         <h2>About</h2>
         
         <p> Sounds have an inherent emotional quality, and vowels
         and consonants convey meaning beyond the words in which they find themselves,
         according to the theory of "sound symbolism." </p>
         
         <p> We analyzed the sounds that make up shakespeare characters' lines to see
         how characters compare to each other purely in terms of the sounds their lines
         consist of.</p>
          
         <p> Each bar represents a vowel; the color of the bar indicates how "light"
         or "dark" the vowel is. From light sounding to dark sounding, the vowels are
         "IH", "IY", "EY", "AY", "AE", "UW", "UH", "AA", "AO".</p>
         
         <p> Bars above the line mean that the character uses more of that vowel than the 
         average character. Bars below the line mean that the character uses less of that
         vowel than the average character.</p>
         
         <p> Hopefully, you can see which characters are "bright"-sounding, "dark"-sounding,
         and which are somewhere in the middle. Use this tool to analyze your favorite characters.</p>
         
         <p> <b>Note:</b> Characters with fewer lines will distort the scales of major
         characters. Filter by number of lines, or uncheck characters using the sidebar.
