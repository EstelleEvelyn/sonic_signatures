class BaseClass(object):
    """
    A very light-weight base class for all Ity classes. Its specific purpose is
    to provide the very simple label and full_label properties, which are
    useful for tracking the provenance of the return values of various Ity
    classes. For example, if two rules returned by two different Taggers' tag()
    methods had the same "name" value, we would be able to determine that they
    do not, in fact, refer to the same rule, because the rules' "full_name"
    values would have swizzled in their Tagger class's full_label properties.
    In general, self._label should be used to set a "human-readable" label for
    the class, while self._full_label should contain additional, non-redundant
    information about the class's return value/s which make it unique. For
    example, we could infer if the output of two classes **should** be
    identical if the class's full_label properties are equal. It's up to those
    classes to swizzle in additional information that will affect its return
    values::
        tokenizer_one = RegexTokenizer(case_sensitive=True)
        tokenizer_two = RegexTokenizer(case_sensitive=False)
        if tokenizer_one.full_label == tokenizer_two.full_label:
            raise StandardError("tokenizer_two's tokenizer() method could\
            produce different output than tokenizer_one.tokenize(), but we\
            can't tell because the implementer didn't update self._full_label.")
        else:
            print "Looks like tokenizer_one and tokenizer_two could have\
            different output, as expected."

        nasty str which swizzles in all possible settings that might affect the
