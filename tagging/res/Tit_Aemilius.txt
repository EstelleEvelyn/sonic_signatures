


Arm my lords Rome never had more cause

The Goths have gathered head and with a power

Of high-resolvd men bent to the spoil

They hither march amain under conduct

Of Lucius son to old Andronicus

Who threats in course of this revenge to do

As much as ever Coriolanus did

Your bidding shall I do effectually

Lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths

The Roman Emperor greets you all by me

And for he understands you are in arms

He craves a parley at your father's house

Willing you to demand your hostages

And they shall be immediately delivered

Come come thou reverend man of Rome

And bring our emperor gently in thy hand

Lucius our emperor for well I know

The common voice do cry it shall be so
