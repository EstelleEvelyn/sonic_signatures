


Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield

Thy crazd title to my certain right

I love thee not therefore pursue me not

Where is Lysander and fair Hermia

The one I'll stay the other stayeth me

Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood

And here am I and wood within this wood

Because I cannot meet my Hermia

Hence get thee gone and follow me no more

Do I entice you Do I speak you fair

Or rather do I not in plainest truth

Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you

Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit

For I am sick when I do look on thee

You do impeach your modesty too much

To leave the city and commit yourself

Into the hands of one that loves you not

To trust the opportunity of night

And the ill counsel of a desert place

With the rich worth of your virginity

I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes

And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts

I will not stay thy questions Let me go

Or if thou follow me do not believe

But I shall do thee mischief in the wood

I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus

Stay on thy peril I alone will go

O why rebuke you him that loves you so

Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe

So should the murdered look and so should I

Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty

Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear

As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere

I had rather give his carcass to my hounds

You spend your passion on a misprised mood

I am not guilty of Lysander's blood

Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell

An if I could what should I get therefor

There is no following her in this fierce vein

Here therefore for a while I will remain

So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow

For debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe

Which now in some slight measure it will pay

If for his tender here I make some stay

O Helen goddess nymph perfect divine

To what my love shall I compare thine eyne

Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show

Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow

That pure congeald white high Taurus' snow

Fanned with the eastern wind turns to a crow

When thou hold'st up thy hand O let me kiss

This princess of pure white this seal of bliss

Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none

If e'er I loved her all that love is gone

My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned

And now to Helen is it home returned

There to remain

Disparage not the faith thou dost not know

Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear

Look where thy love comes Yonder is thy dear

If she cannot entreat I can compel

I say I love thee more than he can do

Quick come

 No no He'll

Seem to break loose Take on as you would follow

But yet come not You are a tame man go

I would I had your bond For I perceive

A weak bond holds you I'll not trust your word

No sir she shall not though you take her part

You are too officious

In her behalf that scorns your services

Let her alone Speak not of Helena

Take not her part For if thou dost intend

Never so little show of love to her

Thou shalt aby it

Follow Nay I'll go with thee cheek by jowl

Lysander speak again

Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled

Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head

Yea art thou there

Abide me if thou dar'st for well I wot

Thou runn'st before me shifting every place

And dar'st not stand nor look me in the face

Where art thou now

Nay then thou mock'st me Thou shalt buy this dear

If ever I thy face by daylight see

Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me

To measure out my length on this cold bed

By day's approach look to be visited

My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth

Of this their purpose hither to this wood

And I in fury hither followed them

Fair Helena in fancy following me

But my good lord I wot not by what power

But by some power it is my love to Hermia

Melted as the snow seems to me now

As the remembrance of an idle gaud

Which in my childhood I did dote upon

And all the faith the virtue of my heart

The object and the pleasure of mine eye

Is only Helena To her my lord

Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia

But like a sickness did I loathe this food

But as in health come to my natural taste

Now I do wish it love it long for it

And will forevermore be true to it

These things seem small and undistinguishable

Like far-off mountains turnd into clouds

Are you sure

That we are awake It seems to me

That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think

The Duke was here and bid us follow him

Why then we are awake Let's follow him

And by the way let us recount our dreams

No wonder my lord One lion may when

many asses do

It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard

discourse my lord

No remedy my lord when walls are so

willful to hear without warning

The very best at a beast my lord that e'er I

saw

Not so my lord for his valor cannot carry

his discretion and the fox carries the goose

He should have worn the horns on his

head

He dares not come there for the candle

for you see it is already in snuff

Why all these should be in the lanthorn

for all these are in the moon But silence Here

comes Thisbe

Well roared Lion

And then came Pyramus

No die but an ace for him for he is but

one

A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus

which Thisbe is the better he for a man God

warrant us she for a woman God bless us

And thus she means videlicet

Ay and Wall too
