He is at hand and Pindarus is come

To do you salutation from his master

With courtesy and with respect enough

But not with such familiar instances

Nor with such free and friendly conference

As he hath used of old

They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered

The greater part the horse in general

Are come with Cassius

You shall not come to them

My lord

And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I

Brutus my country's friend Know me for Brutus

O young and noble Cato art thou down

Why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius

And mayst be honored being Cato's son

Only I yield to die

There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight

Kill Brutus and be honored in his death

Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough

I dare assure thee that no enemy

Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus

The gods defend him from so great a shame

When you do find him or alive or dead

He will be found like Brutus like himself

So Brutus should be foundI thank thee Brutus

That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true
