testimony of a good conscience.

Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are

sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least. But, sir, I

assure you, it was a buck of the first head.

Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book.

He hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk

ink. His intellect is not replenished. He is only an

animal, only sensible in the duller parts.

And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be—

Which we of taste and feeling are—for those parts that do fructify in us more than he.

For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,

So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school.

But omne bene, say I, being of an old father’s mind:

Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.

A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.

Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it

shall please you to abrogate scurrility.

A rare talent.

Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may

my parishioners, for their sons are well tutored by

you, and their daughters profit very greatly under

you. You are a good member of the

commonwealth.

Ay, sir, and very learned.

If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?

Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed!

Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll faithful prove.

Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.

Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,

Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend.

If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice.

Well-learnèd is that tongue that well can thee commend.

All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;

Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire.

Thy eye Jove’s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,

Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.

Celestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong,

That sings heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.

Sir, you have done this in the fear of God

very religiously; and, as a certain Father saith—

Marvelous well for the pen.

And thank you too; for society, saith the

text, is the happiness of life.

I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at

dinner have been sharp and sententious, pleasant

without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious

without impudency, learned without opinion,

and strange without heresy. I did converse this

quondam day with a companion of the King’s, who

is intituled, nominated, or called Don Adriano de

Armado.

A most singular and choice epithet.

Laus Deo, bone intelligo.

Videsne quis venit?

Where will you find men worthy enough to

present them?

When in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander.

By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might.

My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander—

When in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander—
