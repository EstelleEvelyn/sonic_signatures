


The good time of day to you sir

Upon that were my thoughts tiring when

we encountered I hope it is not so low with him as

he made it seem in the trial of his several friends

I should think so He hath sent me an

earnest inviting which many my near occasions

did urge me to put off but he hath conjured me

beyond them and I must needs appear

I am sick of that grief too as I understand

how all things go

A thousand pieces

What of you

Ever at the best hearing well of your

Lordship

I hope it remains not unkindly with your

Lordship that I returned you an empty messenger

Royal cheer I warrant you

How do you What's the news

Alcibiades banished

How How

How now my lords

He's but a mad lord and naught but

humors sways him He gave me a jewel th' other

day and now he has beat it out of my hat Did you

see my jewel

Let's make no stay
