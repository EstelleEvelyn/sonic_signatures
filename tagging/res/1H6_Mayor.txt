


Fie lords that you being supreme magistrates

Thus contumeliously should break the peace

Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife

But to make open proclamation

Come officer as loud as e'er thou canst cry

I'll call for clubs if you will not away

This cardinal's more haughty than the devil

See the coast cleared and then we will depart

Good God these nobles should such stomachs bear

I myself fight not once in forty year

O my good lords and virtuous Henry

Pity the city of London pity us

The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men

Forbidden late to carry any weapon

Have filled their pockets full of pebble stones

And banding themselves in contrary parts

Do pelt so fast at one another's pate

That many have their giddy brains knocked out

Our windows are broke down in every street

And we for fear compelled to shut our shops
