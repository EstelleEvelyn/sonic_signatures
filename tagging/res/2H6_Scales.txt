


How now Is Jack Cade slain

Such aid as I can spare you shall command

But I am troubled here with them myself

The rebels have essayed to win the Tower

But get you to Smithfield and gather head

And thither I will send you Matthew Gough

Fight for your king your country and your lives

And so farewell for I must hence again
