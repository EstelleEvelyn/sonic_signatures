Renownèd Lucius, from our troops I strayed

To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,

And as I earnestly did fix mine eye

Upon the wasted building, suddenly

I heard a child cry underneath a wall.

I made unto the noise, when soon I heard

The crying babe controlled with this discourse:

“Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame!

Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,

Had nature lent thee but thy mother’s look,

Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.

But where the bull and cow are both milk white,

They never do beget a coal-black calf.

Peace, villain, peace!”—even thus he rates the babe—

“For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth

Who, when he knows thou art the Empress’ babe,

Will hold thee dearly for thy mother’s sake.”

With this, my weapon drawn, I rushed upon him,

Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither

To use as you think needful of the man.
