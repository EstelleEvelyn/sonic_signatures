If it might please you to enforce no further

The griefs between you to forget them quite

Were to remember that the present need

Speaks to atone you

Welcome from Egypt sir

We have cause to be glad that matters are so

well digested You stayed well by 't in Egypt

Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast

and but twelve persons there Is this true

She's a most triumphant lady if report be

square to her

Now Antony must leave her utterly

If beauty wisdom modesty can settle

The heart of Antony Octavia is

A blessd lottery to him

We shall

As I conceive the journey be at the Mount

Before you Lepidus

Sir good success

Show 's the way sir

Cup us till the world go round

Cup us till the world go round

This in the public eye

Let Rome be thus informed

He'll never yield to that

Welcome dear madam

Each heart in Rome does love and pity you

Only th' adulterous Antony most large

In his abominations turns you off

And gives his potent regiment to a trull

That noises it against us

Caesar must think

When one so great begins to rage he's hunted

Even to falling Give him no breath but now

Make boot of his distraction Never anger

Made good guard for itself

His taints and honors

Waged equal with him

When such a spacious mirror's set before him

He needs must see himself

Dolabella

Make way there Caesar

A way there a way for Caesar
