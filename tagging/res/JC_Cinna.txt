


To find out you Who's that Metellus Cimber

I am glad on 't What a fearful night is this

There's two or three of us have seen strange sights

Yes you are O Cassius if you could

But win the noble Brutus to our party

All but Metellus Cimber and he's gone

To seek you at your house Well I will hie

And so bestow these papers as you bade me

O pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines

That fret the clouds are messengers of day

No by no means

Be that the uttermost and fail not then

Casca you are the first that rears your hand

O Caesar

Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead

Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets

Here quite confounded with this mutiny
