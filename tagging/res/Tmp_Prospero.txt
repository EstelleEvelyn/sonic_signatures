
Be collected

No more amazement Tell your piteous heart

There's no harm done

No harm

I have done nothing but in care of thee

Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who

Art ignorant of what thou art naught knowing

Of whence I am nor that I am more better

Than Prospero master of a full poor cell

And thy no greater father

'Tis time

I should inform thee farther Lend thy hand

And pluck my magic garment from me  So

Lie there my artWipe thou thine eyes Have comfort

The direful spectacle of the wrack which touched

The very virtue of compassion in thee

I have with such provision in mine art

So safely ordered that there is no soul

No not so much perdition as an hair

Betid to any creature in the vessel

Which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink Sit down

For thou must now know farther

The hour's now come

The very minute bids thee ope thine ear

Obey and be attentive Canst thou remember

A time before we came unto this cell

I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not

Out three years old

By what By any other house or person

Of anything the image tell me that

Hath kept with thy remembrance

Thou hadst and more Miranda But how is it

That this lives in thy mind What seest thou else

In the dark backward and abysm of time

If thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here

How thou cam'st here thou mayst

Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since

Thy father was the Duke of Milan and

A prince of power

Thy mother was a piece of virtue and

She said thou wast my daughter And thy father

Was Duke of Milan and his only heir

And princess no worse issued

Both both my girl

By foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence

But blessedly holp hither

My brother and thy uncle called Antonio

I pray thee mark methat a brother should

Be so perfidioushe whom next thyself

Of all the world I loved and to him put

The manage of my state as at that time

Through all the signories it was the first

And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed

In dignity and for the liberal arts

Without a parallel Those being all my study

The government I cast upon my brother

And to my state grew stranger being transported

And rapt in secret studies Thy false uncle

Dost thou attend me

Being once perfected how to grant suits

How to deny them who t' advance and who

To trash for overtopping new created

The creatures that were mine I say or changed 'em

Or else new formed 'em having both the key

Of officer and office set all hearts i' th' state

To what tune pleased his ear that now he was

The ivy which had hid my princely trunk

And sucked my verdure out on 't Thou attend'st not

I pray thee mark me

I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated

To closeness and the bettering of my mind

With that which but by being so retired

O'erprized all popular rate in my false brother

Awaked an evil nature and my trust

Like a good parent did beget of him

A falsehood in its contrary as great

As my trust was which had indeed no limit

A confidence sans bound He being thus lorded

Not only with what my revenue yielded

But what my power might else exact like one

Who having into truth by telling of it

Made such a sinner of his memory

To credit his own lie he did believe

He was indeed the Duke out o' th' substitution

And executing th' outward face of royalty

With all prerogative Hence his ambition growing

Dost thou hear

To have no screen between this part he played

And him he played it for he needs will be

Absolute Milan Me poor man my library

Was dukedom large enough Of temporal royalties

He thinks me now incapable confederates

So dry he was for sway wi' th' King of Naples

To give him annual tribute do him homage

Subject his coronet to his crown and bend

The dukedom yet unbowedalas poor Milan

To most ignoble stooping

Mark his condition and th' event Then tell me

If this might be a brother

Now the condition

This King of Naples being an enemy

To me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit

Which was that he in lieu o' th' premises

Of homage and I know not how much tribute

Should presently extirpate me and mine

Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan

With all the honors on my brother whereon

A treacherous army levied one midnight

Fated to th' purpose did Antonio open

The gates of Milan and i' th' dead of darkness

The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence

Me and thy crying self

Hear a little further

And then I'll bring thee to the present business

Which now 's upon 's without the which this story

Were most impertinent

Well demanded wench

My tale provokes that question Dear they durst not

So dear the love my people bore me nor set

A mark so bloody on the business but

With colors fairer painted their foul ends

In few they hurried us aboard a bark

Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared

A rotten carcass of a butt not rigged

Nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats

Instinctively have quit it There they hoist us

To cry to th' sea that roared to us to sigh

To th' winds whose pity sighing back again

Did us but loving wrong

O a cherubin

Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile

Infusd with a fortitude from heaven

When I have decked the sea with drops full salt

Under my burden groaned which raised in me

An undergoing stomach to bear up

Against what should ensue

By providence divine

Some food we had and some fresh water that

A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo

Out of his charity who being then appointed

Master of this design did give us with

Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries

Which since have steaded much So of his gentleness

Knowing I loved my books he furnished me

From mine own library with volumes that

I prize above my dukedom

Now I arise

Sit still and hear the last of our sea-sorrow

Here in this island we arrived and here

Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit

Than other princes can that have more time

For vainer hours and tutors not so careful

Know thus far forth

By accident most strange bountiful Fortune

Now my dear lady hath mine enemies

Brought to this shore and by my prescience

I find my zenith doth depend upon

A most auspicious star whose influence

If now I court not but omit my fortunes

Will ever after droop Here cease more questions

Thou art inclined to sleep 'Tis a good dullness

And give it way I know thou canst not choose

Come away servant come I am ready now

Approach my Ariel Come

Hast thou spirit

Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee

My brave spirit

Who was so firm so constant that this coil

Would not infect his reason

Why that's my spirit

But was not this nigh shore

But are they Ariel safe

Of the King's ship

The mariners say how thou hast disposed

And all the rest o' th' fleet

Ariel thy charge

Exactly is performed But there's more work

What is the time o' th' day

At least two glasses The time 'twixt six and now

Must by us both be spent most preciously

How now Moody

What is 't thou canst demand

Before the time be out No more

Dost thou forget

From what a torment I did free thee

Thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze

Of the salt deep

To run upon the sharp wind of the North

To do me business in the veins o' th' Earth

When it is baked with frost

Thou liest malignant thing Hast thou forgot

The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy

Was grown into a hoop Hast thou forgot her

Thou hast Where was she born Speak Tell me

O was she so I must

Once in a month recount what thou hast been

Which thou forget'st This damned witch Sycorax

For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible

To enter human hearing from Argier

Thou know'st was banished For one thing she did

They would not take her life Is not this true

This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child

And here was left by th' sailors Thou my slave

As thou report'st thyself was then her servant

And for thou wast a spirit too delicate

To act her earthy and abhorred commands

Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee

By help of her more potent ministers

And in her most unmitigable rage

Into a cloven pine within which rift

Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain

A dozen years within which space she died

And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans

As fast as mill wheels strike Then was this island

Save for the son that she did litter here

A freckled whelp hag-born not honored with

A human shape

Dull thing I say so he that Caliban

Whom now I keep in service Thou best know'st

What torment I did find thee in Thy groans

Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts

Of ever-angry bears It was a torment

To lay upon the damned which Sycorax

Could not again undo It was mine art

When I arrived and heard thee that made gape

The pine and let thee out

If thou more murmur'st I will rend an oak

And peg thee in his knotty entrails till

Thou hast howled away twelve winters

Do so and after two days

I will discharge thee

Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea Be subject

To no sight but thine and mine invisible

To every eyeball else Go take this shape

And hither come in 't Go hence with diligence

Awake dear heart awake Thou hast slept well

Awake

Shake it off Come on

We'll visit Caliban my slave who never

Yields us kind answer

But as 'tis

We cannot miss him He does make our fire

Fetch in our wood and serves in offices

That profit usWhat ho slave Caliban

Thou earth thou speak

Come forth I say There's other business for thee

Come thou tortoise When

Fine apparition My quaint Ariel

Hark in thine ear

Thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself

Upon thy wicked dam come forth

For this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps

Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up Urchins

Shall forth at vast of night that they may work

All exercise on thee Thou shalt be pinched

As thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging

Than bees that made 'em

Thou most lying slave

Whom stripes may move not kindness I have used thee

Filth as thou art with humane care and lodged thee

In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate

The honor of my child

Hagseed hence

Fetch us in fuel and be quick thou 'rt best

To answer other business Shrugg'st thou malice

If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly

What I command I'll rack thee with old cramps

Fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar

That beasts shall tremble at thy din

So slave hence

The fringd curtains of thine eye advance

And say what thou seest yond

No wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses

As we have such This gallant which thou seest

Was in the wrack and but he's something stained

With griefthat's beauty's cankerthou might'st call him

A goodly person He hath lost his fellows

And strays about to find 'em

It goes on I see

As my soul prompts it Spirit fine spirit I'll free thee

Within two days for this

How The best

What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee

The Duke of Milan

And his more braver daughter could control thee

If now 'twere fit to do 't At the first sight

They have changed eyesDelicate Ariel

I'll set thee free for this A word good sir

I fear you have done yourself some wrong A word

Soft sir one word more

They are both in either's powers But this swift business

I must uneasy make lest too light winning

Make the prize light One word more I charge thee

That thou attend me Thou dost here usurp

The name thou ow'st not and hast put thyself

Upon this island as a spy to win it

From me the lord on 't

Follow me

Speak not you for him He's a traitor Come

I'll manacle thy neck and feet together

Sea water shalt thou drink Thy food shall be

The fresh-brook mussels withered roots and husks

Wherein the acorn cradled Follow

What I say

My foot my tutorPut thy sword up traitor

Who mak'st a show but dar'st not strike thy conscience

Is so possessed with guilt Come from thy ward

For I can here disarm thee with this stick

And make thy weapon drop

Hence Hang not on my garments

Silence One word more

Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee What

An advocate for an impostor Hush

Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he

Having seen but him and Caliban Foolish wench

To th' most of men this is a Caliban

And they to him are angels

Come on obey

Thy nerves are in their infancy again

And have no vigor in them

It worksCome on

Thou hast done well fine ArielFollow me

Hark what thou else shalt do me

Thou shalt be as free

As mountain winds but then exactly do

All points of my command

Come follow Speak not for him

Poor worm thou art infected

This visitation shows it

Fair encounter

Of two most rare affections Heavens rain grace

On that which breeds between 'em

So glad of this as they I cannot be

Who are surprised withal but my rejoicing

At nothing can be more I'll to my book

For yet ere suppertime must I perform

Much business appertaining

Honest lord

Thou hast said well for some of you there present

Are worse than devils

Praise in departing

Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou

Performed my Ariel A grace it had devouring

Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated

In what thou hadst to say So with good life

And observation strange my meaner ministers

Their several kinds have done My high charms work

And these mine enemies are all knit up

In their distractions They now are in my power

And in these fits I leave them while I visit

Young Ferdinand whom they suppose is drowned

And his and mine loved darling

If I have too austerely punished you

Your compensation makes amends for I

Have given you here a third of mine own life

Or that for which I live who once again

I tender to thy hand All thy vexations

Were but my trials of thy love and thou

Hast strangely stood the test Here afore heaven

I ratify this my rich gift O Ferdinand

Do not smile at me that I boast of her

For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise

And make it halt behind her

Then as my gift and thine own acquisition

Worthily purchased take my daughter But

If thou dost break her virgin-knot before

All sanctimonious ceremonies may

With full and holy rite be ministered

No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall

To make this contract grow but barren hate

Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew

The union of your bed with weeds so loathly

That you shall hate it both Therefore take heed

As Hymen's lamps shall light you

Fairly spoke

Sit then and talk with her She is thine own

What Ariel my industrious servant Ariel

Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service

Did worthily perform and I must use you

In such another trick Go bring the rabble

O'er whom I give thee power here to this place

Incite them to quick motion for I must

Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple

Some vanity of mine art It is my promise

And they expect it from me

Ay with a twink

Dearly my delicate Ariel Do not approach

Till thou dost hear me call

Look thou be true do not give dalliance

Too much the rein The strongest oaths are straw

To th' fire i' th' blood Be more abstemious

Or else goodnight your vow

Well

Now come my Ariel Bring a corollary

Rather than want a spirit Appear and pertly

No tongue All eyes Be silent

Spirits which by mine art

I have from their confines called to enact

My present fancies

Sweet now silence

Juno and Ceres whisper seriously

There's something else to do Hush and be mute

Or else our spell is marred

I had forgot that foul conspiracy

Of the beast Caliban and his confederates

Against my life The minute of their plot

Is almost comeWell done Avoid No more

You do look my son in a moved sort

As if you were dismayed Be cheerful sir

Our revels now are ended These our actors

As I foretold you were all spirits and

Are melted into air into thin air

And like the baseless fabric of this vision

The cloud-capped towers the gorgeous palaces

The solemn temples the great globe itself

Yea all which it inherit shall dissolve

And like this insubstantial pageant faded

Leave not a rack behind We are such stuff

As dreams are made on and our little life

Is rounded with a sleep Sir I am vexed

Bear with my weakness My old brain is troubled

Be not disturbed with my infirmity

If you be pleased retire into my cell

And there repose A turn or two I'll walk

To still my beating mind

Come with a thought I thank thee Ariel Come

Spirit

We must prepare to meet with Caliban

Say again where didst thou leave these varlets

This was well done my bird

Thy shape invisible retain thou still

The trumpery in my house go bring it hither

For stale to catch these thieves

A devil a born devil on whose nature

Nurture can never stick on whom my pains

Humanely taken all all lost quite lost

And as with age his body uglier grows

So his mind cankers I will plague them all

Even to roaring    Come hang them on this line

Hey Mountain hey

Fury Fury There Tyrant there Hark hark

Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints

With dry convulsions shorten up their sinews

With agd cramps and more pinch-spotted make them

Than pard or cat o' mountain

Let them be hunted soundly At this hour

Lies at my mercy all mine enemies

Shortly shall all my labors end and thou

Shalt have the air at freedom For a little

Follow and do me service

Now does my project gather to a head

My charms crack not my spirits obey and time

Goes upright with his carriageHow's the day

I did say so

When first I raised the tempest Say my spirit

How fares the King and 's followers

Dost thou think so spirit

And mine shall

Hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling

Of their afflictions and shall not myself

One of their kind that relish all as sharply

Passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art

Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick

Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury

Do I take part The rarer action is

In virtue than in vengeance They being penitent

The sole drift of my purpose doth extend

Not a frown further Go release them Ariel

My charms I'll break their senses I'll restore

And they shall be themselves

You elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves

And you that on the sands with printless foot

Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him

When he comes back you demi-puppets that

By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make

Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime

Is to make midnight mushrumps that rejoice

To hear the solemn curfew by whose aid

Weak masters though you be I have bedimmed

The noontide sun called forth the mutinous winds

And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault

Set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder

Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak

With his own bolt the strong-based promontory

Have I made shake and by the spurs plucked up

The pine and cedar graves at my command

Have waked their sleepers oped and let 'em forth

By my so potent art But this rough magic

I here abjure and when I have required

Some heavenly music which even now I do

To work mine end upon their senses that

This airy charm is for I'll break my staff

Bury it certain fathoms in the earth

And deeper than did ever plummet sound

I'll drown my book

A solemn air and the best comforter

To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains

Now useless boiled within thy skull There stand

For you are spell-stopped

Holy Gonzalo honorable man

Mine eyes e'en sociable to the show of thine

Fall fellowly dropsThe charm dissolves apace

And as the morning steals upon the night

Melting the darkness so their rising senses

Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle

Their clearer reasonO good Gonzalo

My true preserver and a loyal sir

To him thou follow'st I will pay thy graces

Home both in word and deedMost cruelly

Didst thou Alonso use me and my daughter

Thy brother was a furtherer in the act

Thou art pinched for 't now SebastianFlesh and blood

You brother mine that entertained ambition

Expelled remorse and nature whom with Sebastian

Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong

Would here have killed your king I do forgive thee

Unnatural though thou artTheir understanding

Begins to swell and the approaching tide

Will shortly fill the reasonable shore

That now lies foul and muddy Not one of them

That yet looks on me or would know meAriel

Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell

I will discase me and myself present

As I was sometime MilanQuickly spirit

Thou shalt ere long be free

Why that's my dainty Ariel I shall miss

Thee but yet thou shalt have freedom So so so

To the King's ship invisible as thou art

There shalt thou find the mariners asleep

Under the hatches The master and the boatswain

Being awake enforce them to this place

And presently I prithee

Behold sir king

The wrongd Duke of Milan Prospero

For more assurance that a living prince

Does now speak to thee I embrace thy body

And to thee and thy company I bid

A hearty welcome

First noble friend

Let me embrace thine age whose honor cannot

Be measured or confined

You do yet taste

Some subtleties o' th' isle that will not let you

Believe things certain Welcome my friends all

But you my brace of lords were I so minded

I here could pluck his Highness' frown upon you

And justify you traitors At this time

I will tell no tales

No

For you most wicked sir whom to call brother

Would even infect my mouth I do forgive

Thy rankest fault all of them and require

My dukedom of thee which perforce I know

Thou must restore

I am woe for 't sir

I rather think

You have not sought her help of whose soft grace

For the like loss I have her sovereign aid

And rest myself content

As great to me as late and supportable

To make the dear loss have I means much weaker

Than you may call to comfort you for I

Have lost my daughter

In this last tempest I perceive these lords

At this encounter do so much admire

That they devour their reason and scarce think

Their eyes do offices of truth their words

Are natural breathBut howsoe'er you have

Been justled from your senses know for certain

That I am Prospero and that very duke

Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely

Upon this shore where you were wracked was landed

To be the lord on 't No more yet of this

For 'tis a chronicle of day by day

Not a relation for a breakfast nor

Befitting this first meeting Welcome sir

This cell's my court Here have I few attendants

And subjects none abroad Pray you look in

My dukedom since you have given me again

I will requite you with as good a thing

At least bring forth a wonder to content you

As much as me my dukedom

'Tis new to thee

There sir stop

Let us not burden our remembrances with

A heaviness that's gone

My tricksy spirit

Bravely my diligence Thou shalt be free

Sir my liege

Do not infest your mind with beating on

The strangeness of this business At picked leisure

Which shall be shortly single I'll resolve you

Which to you shall seem probable of every

These happened accidents till when be cheerful

And think of each thing well Come hither spirit

Set Caliban and his companions free

Untie the spell How fares my gracious sir

There are yet missing of your company

Some few odd lads that you remember not

Mark but the badges of these men my lords

Then say if they be true This misshapen knave

His mother was a witch and one so strong

That could control the moon make flows and ebbs

And deal in her command without her power

These three have robbed me and this demi-devil

For he's a bastard one had plotted with them

To take my life Two of these fellows you

Must know and own This thing of darkness I

Acknowledge mine

You'd be king o' the isle sirrah

He is as disproportioned in his manners

As in his shape Go sirrah to my cell

Take with you your companions As you look

To have my pardon trim it handsomely

Go to away

Sir I invite your Highness and your train

To my poor cell where you shall take your rest

For this one night which part of it I'll waste

With such discourse as I not doubt shall make it

Go quick away the story of my life

And the particular accidents gone by

Since I came to this isle And in the morn

I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples

Where I have hope to see the nuptial

Of these our dear-belovd solemnized

And thence retire me to my Milan where

Every third thought shall be my grave

I'll deliver all

And promise you calm seas auspicious gales

And sail so expeditious that shall catch

Your royal fleet far off My Ariel chick

That is thy charge Then to the elements

Be free and fare thou wellPlease you draw near

Now my charms are all o'erthrown

And what strength I have 's mine own

Which is most faint Now 'tis true

I must be here confined by you

Or sent to Naples Let me not

Since I have my dukedom got

And pardoned the deceiver dwell

In this bare island by your spell

But release me from my bands

With the help of your good hands

Gentle breath of yours my sails

Must fill or else my project fails

Which was to please Now I want

Spirits to enforce art to enchant

And my ending is despair

Unless I be relieved by prayer

Which pierces so that it assaults

Mercy itself and frees all faults

As you from crimes would pardoned be

Let your indulgence set me free
