She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens

as you are Would we could see you at Corinth

Look you here comes my master's page

Will you leave me there

Are you three usurers' men

I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant

My mistress is one and I am her Fool When men

come to borrow of your masters they approach

sadly and go away merry but they enter my master's

house merrily and go away sadly The reason

of this

A fool in good clothes and something like thee

'Tis a spirit sometime 't appears like a lord sometime

like a lawyer sometime like a philosopher

with two stones more than 's artificial one He is

very often like a knight and generally in all shapes

that man goes up and down in from fourscore to

thirteen this spirit walks in

Nor thou altogether a wise man As much foolery

as I have so much wit thou lack'st

I do not always follow lover elder brother and

woman sometime the philosopher
