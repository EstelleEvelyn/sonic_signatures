
You have fought together

It is your former promise

Noble Martius

Breathe you my friends Well fought We are come off

Like Romans neither foolish in our stands

Nor cowardly in retire Believe me sirs

We shall be charged again Whiles we have struck

By interims and conveying gusts we have heard

The charges of our friends The Roman gods

Lead their successes as we wish our own

That both our powers with smiling fronts encount'ring

May give you thankful sacrifice    Thy news

Though thou speakest truth

Methinks thou speak'st not well How long is 't since

'Tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums

How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour

And bring thy news so late

Who's yonder

That does appear as he were flayed O gods

He has the stamp of Martius and I have

Before-time seen him thus

The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor

More than I know the sound of Martius' tongue

From every meaner man

Ay if you come not in the blood of others

But mantled in your own

Flower of warriors how is 't with Titus Lartius

Where is that slave

Which told me they had beat you to your trenches

Where is he Call him hither

But how prevailed you

Martius we have at disadvantage fought

And did retire to win our purpose

As I guess Martius

Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates

Of their best trust o'er them Aufidius

Their very heart of hope

Though I could wish

You were conducted to a gentle bath

And balms applied to you yet dare I never

Deny your asking Take your choice of those

That best can aid your action

March on my fellows

Make good this ostentation and you shall

Divide in all with us

If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work

Thou 't not believe thy deeds But I'll report it

Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles

Where great patricians shall attend and shrug

I' th' end admire where ladies shall be frighted

And gladly quaked hear more where the dull tribunes

That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honors

Shall say against their hearts We thank the gods

Our Rome hath such a soldier

Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast

Having fully dined before

You shall not be

The grave of your deserving Rome must know

The value of her own 'Twere a concealment

Worse than a theft no less than a traducement

To hide your doings and to silence that

Which to the spire and top of praises vouched

Would seem but modest Therefore I beseech you

In sign of what you are not to reward

What you have donebefore our army hear me

Should they not

Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude

And tent themselves with death Of all the horses

Whereof we have ta'en good and good storeof all

The treasure in this field achieved and city

We render you the tenth to be ta'en forth

Before the common distribution

At your only choice

Too modest are you

More cruel to your good report than grateful

To us that give you truly By your patience

If 'gainst yourself you be incensed we'll put you

Like one that means his proper harm in manacles

Then reason safely with you Therefore be it known

As to us to all the world that Caius Martius

Wears this war's garland in token of the which

My noble steed known to the camp I give him

With all his trim belonging And from this time

For what he did before Corioles call him

With all th' applause and clamor of the host

Martius Caius Coriolanus Bear

Th' addition nobly ever

So to our tent

Where ere we do repose us we will write

To Rome of our successYou Titus Lartius

Must to Corioles back Send us to Rome

The best with whom we may articulate

For their own good and ours

Take 't 'tis yours What is 't

O well begged

Were he the butcher of my son he should

Be free as is the windDeliver him Titus

Go we to our tent

The blood upon your visage dries 'tis time

It should be looked to Come

Look sir your mother

Ever right

On to the Capitol

I shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus

Should not be uttered feebly It is held

That valor is the chiefest virtue and

Most dignifies the haver if it be

The man I speak of cannot in the world

Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years

When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought

Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator

Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight

When with his Amazonian chin he drove

The bristled lips before him He bestrid

An o'erpressed Roman and i' th' Consul's view

Slew three opposers Tarquin's self he met

And struck him on his knee In that day's feats

When he might act the woman in the scene

He proved best man i' th' field and for his meed

Was brow-bound with the oak His pupil age

Man-entered thus he waxd like a sea

And in the brunt of seventeen battles since

He lurched all swords of the garland For this last

Before and in Corioles let me say

I cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers

And by his rare example made the coward

Turn terror into sport As weeds before

A vessel under sail so men obeyed

And fell below his stem His sword Death's stamp

Where it did mark it took from face to foot

He was a thing of blood whose every motion

Was timed with dying cries Alone he entered

The mortal gate o' th' city which he painted

With shunless destiny aidless came off

And with a sudden reinforcement struck

Corioles like a planet Now all's his

When by and by the din of war gan pierce

His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit

Requickened what in flesh was fatigate

And to the battle came he where he did

Run reeking o'er the lives of men as if

'Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called

Both field and city ours he never stood

To ease his breast with panting

Our spoils he kicked at

And looked upon things precious as they were

The common muck of the world He covets less

Than misery itself would give rewards

His deeds with doing them and is content

To spend the time to end it

They are worn lord consul so

That we shall hardly in our ages see

Their banners wave again

Hath he not passed the noble and the common

You are like to do such business

The people are abused set on This palt'ring

Becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus

Deserved this so dishonored rub laid falsely

I' th' plain way of his merit

'Twas from the canon

Well on to th' marketplace

Agd sir hands off

Peace peace peace Stay hold peace

Come sir along with us

But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic

And manhood is called foolery when it stands

Against a falling fabric Will you hence

Before the tag return whose rage doth rend

Like interrupted waters and o'erbear

What they are used to bear

Nay come away

I have been i' th' marketplace and sir 'tis fit

You make strong party or defend yourself

By calmness or by absence All's in anger

I think 'twill serve if he

Can thereto frame his spirit

Come come we'll prompt you

Away The Tribunes do attend you Arm yourself

To answer mildly for they are prepared

With accusations as I hear more strong

Than are upon you yet

Well well no more

Know I pray you

Hear me my masters and my common friends

Let me speak

I have been consul and can show for Rome

Her enemies' marks upon me I do love

My country's good with a respect more tender

More holy and profound than mine own life

My dear wife's estimate her womb's increase

And treasure of my loins Then if I would

Speak that

I'll follow thee a month devise with thee

Where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us

And we of thee so if the time thrust forth

A cause for thy repeal we shall not send

O'er the vast world to seek a single man

And lose advantage which doth ever cool

I' th' absence of the needer

O you have made good work

You have holp to ravish your own daughters and

To melt the city leads upon your pates

To see your wives dishonored to your noses

Your temples burnd in their cement and

Your franchises whereon you stood confined

Into an auger's bore

If

He is their god he leads them like a thing

Made by some other deity than Nature

That shapes man better and they follow him

Against us brats with no less confidence

Than boys pursuing summer butterflies

Or butchers killing flies

He'll shake your Rome about your ears

Ay and you'll look pale

Before you find it other All the regions

Do smilingly revolt and who resists

Are mocked for valiant ignorance

And perish constant fools Who is 't can blame him

Your enemies and his find something in him

Who shall ask it

The Tribunes cannot do 't for shame the people

Deserve such pity of him as the wolf

Does of the shepherds For his best friends if they

Should say Be good to Rome they charged him even

As those should do that had deserved his hate

And therein showed like enemies

You have brought

A trembling upon Rome such as was never

S' incapable of help

But I fear

They'll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius

The second name of men obeys his points

As if he were his officer Desperation

Is all the policy strength and defense

That Rome can make against them

You're goodly things you voices

O ay what else

He would not seem to know me

Yet one time he did call me by my name

I urged our old acquaintance and the drops

That we have bled together Coriolanus

He would not answer to forbade all names

He was a kind of nothing titleless

Till he had forged himself a name o' th' fire

Of burning Rome

I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon

When it was less expected He replied

It was a bare petition of a state

To one whom they had punished

I offered to awaken his regard

For 's private friends His answer to me was

He could not stay to pick them in a pile

Of noisome musty chaff He said 'twas folly

For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt

And still to nose th' offense

He'll never hear him

I tell you he does sit in gold his eye

Red as 'twould burn Rome and his injury

The jailor to his pity I kneeled before him

'Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissed me

Thus with his speechless hand What he would do

He sent in writing after me what he

Would not bound with an oath to yield to his

Conditions So that all hope is vain

Unless his noble mother and his wife

Who as I hear mean to solicit him

For mercy to his country Therefore let's hence

And with our fair entreaties haste them on
