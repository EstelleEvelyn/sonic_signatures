


I was by at the opening of the fardel

heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he

found it whereupon after a little amazedness we

were all commanded out of the chamber Only this

methought I heard the shepherd say he found the

child

I make a broken delivery of the

business but the changes I perceived in the King

and Camillo were very notes of admiration They

seemed almost with staring on one another to tear

the cases of their eyes There was speech in their

dumbness language in their very gesture They

looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or

one destroyed A notable passion of wonder appeared

in them but the wisest beholder that knew

no more but seeing could not say if th' importance

were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it

must needs be

Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more

The news Rogero

What became of his bark and his

followers

The dignity of this act was worth the

audience of kings and princes for by such was it

acted

Are they returned to the court

Who would be thence that has the

benefit of access Every wink of an eye some new

grace will be born Our absence makes us unthrifty

to our knowledge Let's along
