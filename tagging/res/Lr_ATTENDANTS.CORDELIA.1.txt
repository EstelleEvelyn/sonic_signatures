Your most dear daughter

You shall have anything

You are a royal one and we obey you

A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch

Past speaking of in a king Thou hast a daughter

Who redeems nature from the general curse

Which twain have brought her to

Sir speed you What's your will

Most sure and vulgar Everyone hears that

Which can distinguish sound

Near and on speedy foot The main descry

Stands on the hourly thought

Though that the Queen on special cause is here

Her army is moved on

Ay madam In the heaviness of sleep

We put fresh garments on him

Holds it true sir that the Duke of Cornwall

was so slain

Who is conductor of his people

They say Edgar his banished son is with

the Earl of Kent in Germany

The arbitrament is like to be bloody Fare

you well sir

'Tis true my lords he did
