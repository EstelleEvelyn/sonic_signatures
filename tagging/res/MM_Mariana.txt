


Break off thy song and haste thee quick away

Here comes a man of comfort whose advice

Hath often stilled my brawling discontent

I cry you mercy sir and well could wish

You had not found me here so musical

Let me excuse me and believe me so

My mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe

You have not been inquired after I have sat

here all day

I am always bound to you

Good friar I know you do and have found it

Will 't please you walk aside

Fear me not

Be ruled by him

I would Friar Peter

Pardon my lord I will not show my face

Until my husband bid me

No my lord

No my lord

Neither my lord

My lord I do confess I ne'er was married

And I confess besides I am no maid

I have known my husband yet my husband

Knows not that ever he knew me

Now I come to 't my lord

She that accuses him of fornication

In selfsame manner doth accuse my husband

And charges him my lord with such a time

When I'll depose I had him in mine arms

With all th' effect of love

Not that I know

Why just my lord and that is Angelo

Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body

But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's

My husband bids me Now I will unmask

This is that face thou cruel Angelo

Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on

This is the hand which with a vowed contract

Was fast belocked in thine This is the body

That took away the match from Isabel

And did supply thee at thy garden house

In her imagined person

Noble prince

As there comes light from heaven and words from breath

As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue

I am affianced this man's wife as strongly

As words could make up vows And my good lord

But Tuesday night last gone in 's garden house

He knew me as a wife As this is true

Let me in safety raise me from my knees

Or else forever be confixd here

A marble monument

O my most gracious lord

I hope you will not mock me with a husband

O my dear lord

I crave no other nor no better man

Gentle my liege

O my good lordSweet Isabel take my part

Lend me your knees and all my life to come

I'll lend you all my life to do you service

Isabel

Sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me

Hold up your hands say nothing I'll speak all

They say best men are molded out of faults

And for the most become much more the better

For being a little bad So may my husband

O Isabel will you not lend a knee

Merely my lord
