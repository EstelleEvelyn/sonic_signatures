Come on Since the youth will not be

entreated his own peril on his forwardness

How now daughter and cousin Are

you crept hither to see the wrestling

You will take little delight in it I can

tell you there is such odds in the man In pity of the

challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him but

he will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if

you can move him

Do so I'll not be by

You shall try but

one fall

No more no more

How dost thou Charles

Bear him away

What is thy name young man

I would thou hadst been son to some man else

The world esteemed thy father honorable

But I did find him still mine enemy

Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed

Hadst thou descended from another house

But fare thee well Thou art a gallant youth

I would thou hadst told me of another father

Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste

And get you from our court

You cousin

Within these ten days if that thou beest found

So near our public court as twenty miles

Thou diest for it

Thus do all traitors

If their purgation did consist in words

They are as innocent as grace itself

Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not

Thou art thy father's daughter There's enough

Ay Celia we stayed her for your sake

Else had she with her father ranged along

She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness

Her very silence and her patience

Speak to the people and they pity her

Thou art a fool She robs thee of thy name

And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous

When she is gone Then open not thy lips

Firm and irrevocable is my doom

Which I have passed upon her She is banished

You are a foolYou niece provide yourself

If you outstay the time upon mine honor

And in the greatness of my word you die

Can it be possible that no man saw them

It cannot be Some villains of my court

Are of consent and sufferance in this

Send to his brother Fetch that gallant hither

If he be absent bring his brother to me

I'll make him find him Do this suddenly

And let not search and inquisition quail

To bring again these foolish runaways

Not see him since Sir sir that cannot be

But were I not the better part made mercy

I should not seek an absent argument

Of my revenge thou present But look to it

Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is

Seek him with candle Bring him dead or living

Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more

To seek a living in our territory

Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine

Worth seizure do we seize into our hands

Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth

Of what we think against thee

More villain thouWell push him out of doors

And let my officers of such a nature

Make an extent upon his house and lands

Do this expediently and turn him going
