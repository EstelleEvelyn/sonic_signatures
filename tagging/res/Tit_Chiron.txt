


Was never Scythia half so barbarous

Demetrius thou dost overween in all

And so in this to bear me down with braves

'Tis not the difference of a year or two

Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate

I am as able and as fit as thou

To serve and to deserve my mistress' grace

And that my sword upon thee shall approve

And plead my passions for Lavinia's love

Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have

Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare

For that I am prepared and full resolved

Foul-spoken coward that thund'rest with thy tongue

And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform

I care not I knew she and all the world

I love Lavinia more than all the world

Aaron a thousand deaths

Would I propose to achieve her whom I love

Ay so the turn were served

Faith not me

Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice

And this for me struck home to show my strength

And if she do I would I were an eunuch

Drag hence her husband to some secret hole

And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust

I warrant you madam we will make that sure

Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy

That nice-preservd honesty of yours

What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard

Nay then I'll stop your mouthBring thou her husband

This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him

Write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so

An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe

Go home Call for sweet water wash thy hands

An 'twere my cause I should go hang myself

Demetrius here's the son of Lucius

He hath some message to deliver us

O 'tis a verse in Horace I know it well

I read it in the grammar long ago

A charitable wish and full of love

And that would she for twenty thousand more

Belike for joy the Emperor hath a son

Thou hast undone our mother

It shall not live

Rome will despise her for this foul escape

I blush to think upon this ignomy

Aaron I see thou wilt not trust the air

With secrets

Show me a villain that hath done a rape

And I am sent to be revenged on him

Tell us old man how shall we be employed

Villains forbear We are the Empress' sons
