


Many years of happy days befall

My gracious sovereign my most loving liege

Firstheaven be the record to my speech

In the devotion of a subject's love

Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince

And free from other misbegotten hate

Come I appellant to this princely presence

Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee

And mark my greeting well for what I speak

My body shall make good upon this earth

Or my divine soul answer it in heaven

Thou art a traitor and a miscreant

Too good to be so and too bad to live

Since the more fair and crystal is the sky

The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly

Once more the more to aggravate the note

With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat

And wish so please my sovereign ere I move

What my tongue speaks my right-drawn sword may prove

Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage

Disclaiming here the kindred of the King

And lay aside my high blood's royalty

Which fear not reverence makes thee to except

If guilty dread have left thee so much strength

As to take up mine honor's pawn then stoop

By that and all the rites of knighthood else

Will I make good against thee arm to arm

What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise

Look what I speak my life shall prove it true

That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles

In name of lendings for your Highness' soldiers

The which he hath detained for lewd employments

Like a false traitor and injurious villain

Besides I say and will in battle prove

Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge

That ever was surveyed by English eye

That all the treasons for these eighteen years

Complotted and contrivd in this land

Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring

Further I say and further will maintain

Upon his bad life to make all this good

That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death

Suggest his soon-believing adversaries

And consequently like a traitor coward

Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood

Which blood like sacrificing Abel's cries

Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth

To me for justice and rough chastisement

And by the glorious worth of my descent

This arm shall do it or this life be spent

O God defend my soul from such deep sin

Shall I seem crestfallen in my father's sight

Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height

Before this out-dared dastard Ere my tongue

Shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong

Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear

The slavish motive of recanting fear

And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace

Where shame doth harbor even in Mowbray's face

Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby

Am I who ready here do stand in arms

To prove by God's grace and my body's valor

In lists on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk

That he is a traitor foul and dangerous

To God of heaven King Richard and to me

And as I truly fight defend me heaven

Lord Marshal let me kiss my sovereign's hand

And bow my knee before his Majesty

For Mowbray and myself are like two men

That vow a long and weary pilgrimage

Then let us take a ceremonious leave

And loving farewell of our several friends

O let no noble eye profane a tear

For me if I be gored with Mowbray's spear

As confident as is the falcon's flight

Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight

My loving lord I take my leave of you

Of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle

Not sick although I have to do with death

But lusty young and cheerly drawing breath

Lo as at English feasts so I regreet

The daintiest last to make the end most sweet

O thou the earthly author of my blood

Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate

Doth with a twofold vigor lift me up

To reach at victory above my head

Add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers

And with thy blessings steel my lance's point

That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat

And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt

Even in the lusty havior of his son

Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive

Strong as a tower in hope I cry Amen

Your will be done This must my comfort be

That sun that warms you here shall shine on me

And those his golden beams to you here lent

Shall point on me and gild my banishment

I swear

Norfolk so far as to mine enemy

By this time had the King permitted us

One of our souls had wandered in the air

Banished this frail sepulcher of our flesh

As now our flesh is banished from this land

Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm

Since thou hast far to go bear not along

The clogging burden of a guilty soul

How long a time lies in one little word

Four lagging winters and four wanton springs

End in a word such is the breath of kings

I have too few to take my leave of you

When the tongue's office should be prodigal

To breathe the abundant dolor of the heart

Joy absent grief is present for that time

To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten

My heart will sigh when I miscall it so

Which finds it an enforcd pilgrimage

Nay rather every tedious stride I make

Will but remember me what a deal of world

I wander from the jewels that I love

Must I not serve a long apprenticehood

To foreign passages and in the end

Having my freedom boast of nothing else

But that I was a journeyman to grief

O who can hold a fire in his hand

By thinking on the frosty Caucasus

Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite

By bare imagination of a feast

Or wallow naked in December snow

By thinking on fantastic summer's heat

O no the apprehension of the good

Gives but the greater feeling to the worse

Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more

Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore

Then England's ground farewell sweet soil adieu

My mother and my nurse that bears me yet

Where'er I wander boast of this I can

Though banished yet a trueborn Englishman

How far is it my lord to Berkeley now

Of much less value is my company

Than your good words But who comes here

I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure

I count myself in nothing else so happy

As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends

And as my fortune ripens with thy love

It shall be still thy true love's recompense

My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it

Welcome my lords I wot your love pursues

A banished traitor All my treasury

Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enriched

Shall be your love and labor's recompense

Evermore thank's the exchequer of the poor

Which till my infant fortune comes to years

Stands for my bounty But who comes here

My lord my answer isto Lancaster

And I am come to seek that name in England

And I must find that title in your tongue

Before I make reply to aught you say

I shall not need transport my words by you

Here comes his Grace in person My noble uncle

My gracious uncle

My gracious uncle let me know my fault

On what condition stands it and wherein

As I was banished I was banished Hereford

But as I come I come for Lancaster

And noble uncle I beseech your Grace

Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye

You are my father for methinks in you

I see old Gaunt alive O then my father

Will you permit that I shall stand condemned

A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties

Plucked from my arms perforce and given away

To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born

If that my cousin king be king in England

It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster

You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin

Had you first died and he been thus trod down

He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father

To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay

I am denied to sue my livery here

And yet my letters patents give me leave

My father's goods are all distrained and sold

And these and all are all amiss employed

What would you have me do I am a subject

And I challenge law Attorneys are denied me

And therefore personally I lay my claim

To my inheritance of free descent

An offer uncle that we will accept

But we must win your Grace to go with us

To Bristow Castle which they say is held

By Bushy Bagot and their complices

The caterpillars of the commonwealth

Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away

Bring forth these men

Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls

Since presently your souls must part your bodies

With too much urging your pernicious lives

For 'twere no charity yet to wash your blood

From off my hands here in the view of men

I will unfold some causes of your deaths

You have misled a prince a royal king

A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments

By you unhappied and disfigured clean

You have in manner with your sinful hours

Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him

Broke the possession of a royal bed

And stained the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks

With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs

Myself a prince by fortune of my birth

Near to the King in blood and near in love

Till you did make him misinterpret me

Have stooped my neck under your injuries

And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds

Eating the bitter bread of banishment

Whilst you have fed upon my seigniories

Disparked my parks and felled my forest woods

From my own windows torn my household coat

Rased out my imprese leaving me no sign

Save men's opinions and my living blood

To show the world I am a gentleman

This and much more much more than twice all this

Condemns you to the deathSee them delivered over

To execution and the hand of death

My Lord Northumberland see them dispatched

Uncle you say the Queen is at your house

For God's sake fairly let her be entreated

Tell her I send to her my kind commends

Take special care my greetings be delivered

Thanks gentle uncleCome lords away

To fight with Glendower and his complices

A while to work and after holiday

So that by this intelligence we learn

The Welshmen are dispersed and Salisbury

Is gone to meet the King who lately landed

With some few private friends upon this coast

Mistake not uncle further than you should

I know it uncle and oppose not myself

Against their will But who comes here

Welcome Harry What will not this castle yield

Royally Why it contains no king

Noble lord

Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle

Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley

Into his ruined ears and thus deliver

Henry Bolingbroke

On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand

And sends allegiance and true faith of heart

To his most royal person hither come

Even at his feet to lay my arms and power

Provided that my banishment repealed

And lands restored again be freely granted

If not I'll use the advantage of my power

And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood

Rained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen

The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke

It is such crimson tempest should bedrench

The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land

My stooping duty tenderly shall show

Go signify as much while here we march

Upon the grassy carpet of this plain

Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum

That from this castle's tottered battlements

Our fair appointments may be well perused

Methinks King Richard and myself should meet

With no less terror than the elements

Of fire and water when their thund'ring shock

At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven

Be he the fire I'll be the yielding water

The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain

My waterson the earth and not on him

March on and mark King Richard how he looks

See see King Richard doth himself appear

As doth the blushing discontented sun

From out the fiery portal of the east

When he perceives the envious clouds are bent

To dim his glory and to stain the track

Of his bright passage to the occident

What says his Majesty

Stand all apart

And show fair duty to his Majesty

My gracious lord

My gracious lord I come but for mine own

So far be mine my most redoubted lord

As my true service shall deserve your love

Yea my good lord

Call forth Bagot

Now Bagot freely speak thy mind

What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death

Who wrought it with the King and who performed

The bloody office of his timeless end

Cousin stand forth and look upon that man

Bagot forbear Thou shalt not take it up

These differences shall all rest under gage

Till Norfolk be repealed Repealed he shall be

And though mine enemy restored again

To all his lands and seigniories When he is returned

Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial

Why bishop is Norfolk dead

Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom

Of good old Abraham Lords appellants

Your differences shall all rest under gage

Till we assign you to your days of trial

In God's name I'll ascend the regal throne

Fetch hither Richard that in common view

He may surrender So we shall proceed

Without suspicion

Lords you that here are under our arrest

Procure your sureties for your days of answer

Little are we beholding to your love

And little looked for at your helping hands

I thought you had been willing to resign

Part of your cares you give me with your crown

Are you contented to resign the crown

Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass

Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland

The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed

The shadow of your face

Name it fair cousin

Yet ask

You shall

Whither

Go some of you convey him to the Tower

On Wednesday next we solemnly set down

Our coronation Lords prepare yourselves

Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son

'Tis full three months since I did see him last

If any plague hang over us 'tis he

I would to God my lords he might be found

Inquire at London 'mongst the taverns there

For there they say he daily doth frequent

With unrestraind loose companions

Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes

And beat our watch and rob our passengers

While he young wanton and effeminate boy

Takes on the point of honor to support

So dissolute a crew

And what said the gallant

As dissolute as desperate Yet through both

I see some sparks of better hope which elder years

May happily bring forth But who comes here

What means our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly

Withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone

What is the matter with our cousin now

Intended or committed was this fault

If on the first how heinous e'er it be

To win thy after-love I pardon thee

Have thy desire

Villain I'll make thee safe

What is the matter uncle Speak

Recover breath Tell us how near is danger

That we may arm us to encounter it

O heinous strong and bold conspiracy

O loyal father of a treacherous son

Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain

From whence this stream through muddy passages

Hath held his current and defiled himself

Thy overflow of good converts to bad

And thy abundant goodness shall excuse

This deadly blot in thy digressing son

What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry

Our scene is altered from a serious thing

And now changed to The Beggar and the King

My dangerous cousin let your mother in

I know she is come to pray for your foul sin

Rise up good aunt

Good aunt stand up

Good aunt stand up

I pardon him as God shall pardon me

I pardon him with all my heart

But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot

With all the rest of that consorted crew

Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels

Good uncle help to order several powers

To Oxford or where'er these traitors are

They shall not live within this world I swear

But I will have them if I once know where

Uncle farewelland cousin adieu

Your mother well hath prayed and prove you true

Kind uncle York the latest news we hear

Is that the rebels have consumed with fire

Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire

But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not

Welcome my lord What is the news

We thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains

And to thy worth will add right worthy gains

Thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot

Right noble is thy merit well I wot

Carlisle this is your doom

Choose out some secret place some reverend room

More than thou hast and with it joy thy life

So as thou liv'st in peace die free from strife

For though mine enemy thou hast ever been

High sparks of honor in thee have I seen

Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought

A deed of slander with thy fatal hand

Upon my head and all this famous land

They love not poison that do poison need

Nor do I thee Though I did wish him dead

I hate the murderer love him murderd

The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor

But neither my good word nor princely favor

With Cain go wander through shades of night

And never show thy head by day nor light

Lords I protest my soul is full of woe

That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow

Come mourn with me for what I do lament

And put on sullen black incontinent

I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land

To wash this blood off from my guilty hand

March sadly after Grace my mournings here

In weeping after this untimely bier
