


One that gives out himself Prince Florizell

Son of Polixenes with his princessshe

The fairest I have yet behelddesires access

To your high presence

But few

And those but mean

Ay the most peerless piece of earth I think

That e'er the sun shone bright on

Pardon madam

The one I have almost forgotyour pardon

The other when she has obtained your eye

Will have your tongue too This is a creature

Would she begin a sect might quench the zeal

Of all professors else make proselytes

Of who she but bid follow

Women will love her that she is a woman

More worth than any man men that she is

The rarest of all women
