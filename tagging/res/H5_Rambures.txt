your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?

Who will go to hazard with me for twenty

prisoners?

He longs to eat the English.

That island of England breeds very valiant

creatures. Their mastiffs are of unmatchable

courage.

What, will you have them weep our horses’ blood?

How shall we then behold their natural tears?
