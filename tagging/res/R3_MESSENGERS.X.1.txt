


Such news my lord as grieves me to report

Well madam and in health

Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret

And with them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisoners

The mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham

The sum of all I can I have disclosed

Why or for what the nobles were committed

Is all unknown to me my gracious lord
