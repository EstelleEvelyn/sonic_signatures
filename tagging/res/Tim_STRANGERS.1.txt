


We know him for no less though we

are but strangers to him But I can tell you one

thing my lord and which I hear from common

rumors now Lord Timon's happy hours are done

and past and his estate shrinks from him

Do you observe this Hostilius

Why this is the world's soul and just of the same piece

Is every flatterer's sport Who can call him his friend

That dips in the same dish For in my knowing

Timon has been this lord's father

And kept his credit with his purse

Supported his estate nay Timon's money

Has paid his men their wages He ne'er drinks

But Timon's silver treads upon his lip

And yetO see the monstrousness of man

When he looks out in an ungrateful shape

He does deny him in respect of his

What charitable men afford to beggars

For mine own part

I never tasted Timon in my life

Nor came any of his bounties over me

To mark me for his friend Yet I protest

For his right noble mind illustrious virtue

And honorable carriage

Had his necessity made use of me

I would have put my wealth into donation

And the best half should have returned to him

So much I love his heart But I perceive

Men must learn now with pity to dispense

For policy sits above conscience
