
Sir

I'll follow you at heels The feast's solemnity

Shall want till your return

No further

Though I know

His ocean needs not my poor drops yet they

Must yield their tribute thereMy precious maid

Those best affections that the heavens infuse

In their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned

In your dear heart

Peace be to you

As I pursue this war which shall be then

Beyond further requiring

Upon my soul a proper man

How do you like him lady

Mark how his virtue like a hidden sun

Breaks through his baser garments

All his words are worthy

Thanks Theseus

Whate'er you are you're mine and I shall give you

To a most noble service to this lady

This bright young virgin  Pray observe her goodness

You have honored her fair birthday with your virtues

And as your due you're hers Kiss her fair hand sir

I'll see you furnished and because you say

You are a horseman I must needs entreat you

This afternoon to ridebut 'tis a rough one

Some country sport upon my life sir

Produce

And here's something to paint your pole withal

O heaven

What more than man is this

Nay then I'll in too

By all our friendship sir by all our dangers

By all you love most wars and this sweet lady

To crown all this by your most noble soul

Which cannot want due mercy I beg first

For mercy

Urge it home brave lady

These are men

Let it not fall again sir

I awhile

Yet a great deal short

Methinks of him that's first with Palamon

I guess he is a prince too

And if it may be greater for his show

Has all the ornament of honor in 't

He's somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of

But of a face far sweeter his complexion

Is as a ripe grape ruddy He has felt

Without doubt what he fights for and so apter

To make this cause his own In 's face appears

All the fair hopes of what he undertakes

And when he's angry then a settled valor

Not tainted with extremes runs through his body

And guides his arm to brave things Fear he cannot

He shows no such soft temper His head's yellow

Hard-haired and curled thick-twined like ivy tods

Not to undo with thunder In his face

The livery of the warlike maid appears

Pure red and white for yet no beard has blessed him

And in his rolling eyes sits Victory

As if she ever meant to crown his valor

His nose stands high a character of honor

His red lips after fights are fit for ladies

When he speaks his tongue

Sounds like a trumpet All his lineaments

Are as a man would wish 'em strong and clean

He wears a well-steeled axe the staff of gold

His age some five-and-twenty

O he that's freckle-faced

Yes they are well

They are all the sons of honor

Yes sir

There shall want no bravery

Sir they enter

Honor crown the worthiest

Will you lose this sight

Sir my good lord

Your sister will no further

Hold ho It is a cursd haste you made

If you have done so quicklyNoble Palamon

The gods will show their glory in a life

That thou art yet to lead

Arise great sir and give the tidings ear

That are most dearly sweet and bitter

List then your cousin

Mounted upon a steed that Emily

Did first bestow on hima black one owing

Not a hair worth of white which some will say

Weakens his price and many will not buy

His goodness with this note which superstition

Here finds allowanceon this horse is Arcite

Trotting the stones of Athenswhich the calkins

Did rather tell than trample for the horse

Would make his length a mile if 't pleased his rider

To put pride in him As he thus went counting

The flinty pavement dancing as 'twere to th' music

His own hooves madefor as they say from iron

Came music's originwhat envious flint

Cold as old Saturn and like him possessed

With fire malevolent darted a spark

Or what fierce sulphur else to this end made

I comment not the hot horse hot as fire

Took toy at this and fell to what disorder

His power could give his will bounds comes on end

Forgets school-doing being therein trained

And of kind manage Pig-like he whines

At the sharp rowel which he frets at rather

Than any jot obeys seeks all foul means

Of boist'rous and rough jadery to disseat

His lord that kept it bravely When naught served

When neither curb would crack girth break nor diff'ring plunges

Disroot his rider whence he grew but that

He kept him 'tween his legs on his hind hoofs

On end he stands

That Arcite's legs being higher than his head

Seemed with strange art to hang His victor's wreath

Even then fell off his head and presently

Backward the jade comes o'er and his full poise

Becomes the rider's load Yet is he living

But such a vessel 'tis that floats but for

The surge that next approaches He much desires

To have some speech with you Lo he appears
