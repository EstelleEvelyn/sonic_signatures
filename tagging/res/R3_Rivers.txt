


Have patience madam There's no doubt his Majesty

Will soon recover his accustomed health

Is it concluded he shall be Protector

She may my lord for

What marry may she

My lord of Gloucester in those busy days

Which here you urge to prove us enemies

We followed then our lord our sovereign king

So should we you if you should be our king

Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported

Were you well served you would be taught your duty

And so doth mine I muse why she's at liberty

A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion

To pray for them that have done scathe to us

We wait upon your Grace

By heaven my soul is purged from grudging hate

And with my hand I seal my true heart's love

And I as I love Hastings with my heart

Madam bethink you like a careful mother

Of the young prince your son Send straight for him

Let him be crowned In him your comfort lives

Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave

And plant your joys in living Edward's throne

Why with some little train my lord of Buckingham

And so in me and so I think in all

Yet since it is but green it should be put

To no apparent likelihood of breach

Which haply by much company might be urged

Therefore I say with noble Buckingham

That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince

Sir Richard Ratcliffe let me tell thee this

Today shalt thou behold a subject die

For truth for duty and for loyalty

O Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison

Fatal and ominous to noble peers

Within the guilty closure of thy walls

Richard the Second here was hacked to death

And for more slander to thy dismal seat

We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink

Then cursed she Richard Then cursed she Buckingham

Then cursed she Hastings O remember God

To hear her prayer for them as now for us

And for my sister and her princely sons

Be satisfied dear God with our true blood

Which as thou know'st unjustly must be spilt

Come Grey Come Vaughan Let us here embrace

Farewell until we meet again in heaven

Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow

Rivers that died at Pomfret Despair and die

Awake and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom

Will conquer him Awake and win the day
