That in such haste I sent to seek his master?

Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.

Why should their liberty than ours be more?

Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

There’s none but asses will be bridled so.

This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

How if your husband start some otherwhere?

Patience unmoved! No marvel though she pause;

They can be meek that have no other cause.

A wretched soul bruised with adversity

We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,

But were we burdened with like weight of pain,

As much or more we should ourselves complain.

So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,

With urging helpless patience would relieve me;

But if thou live to see like right bereft,

This fool-begged patience in thee will be left.

Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

Say, didst thou speak with him? Know’st thou his mind?

But say, I prithee, is he coming home?

It seems he hath great care to please his wife.

Horn mad, thou villain?

Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

Hence, prating peasant. Fetch thy master home.

His company must do his minions grace,

Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.

Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took

From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.

Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?

If voluble and sharp discourse be marred,

Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.

Do their gay vestments his affections bait?

That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state.

What ruins are in me that can be found

By him not ruined? Then is he the ground

Of my defeatures. My decayèd fair

A sunny look of his would soon repair.

But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale

And feeds from home. Poor I am but his stale.

Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.

I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,

Or else what lets it but he would be here?

Sister, you know he promised me a chain.

Would that alone o’ love he would detain,

So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.

I see the jewel best enamelèd

Will lose his beauty. Yet the gold bides still

That others touch, and often touching will

Wear gold; yet no man that hath a name

By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.

Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,

I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.

Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.

Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects.

I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.

The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow

That never words were music to thine ear,

That never object pleasing in thine eye,

That never touch well welcome to thy hand,

That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste,

Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to thee.

How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it

That thou art then estrangèd from thyself?

“Thyself” I call it, being strange to me,

That, undividable, incorporate,

Am better than thy dear self’s better part.

Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!

For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall

A drop of water in the breaking gulf,

And take unmingled thence that drop again

Without addition or diminishing,

As take from me thyself and not me too.

How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,

Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious

And that this body, consecrate to thee,

By ruffian lust should be contaminate!

Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,

And hurl the name of husband in my face,

And tear the stained skin off my harlot brow,

And from my false hand cut the wedding ring,

And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?

I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.

I am possessed with an adulterate blot;

My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;

For if we two be one, and thou play false,

I do digest the poison of thy flesh,

Being strumpeted by thy contagion.

Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,

I live distained, thou undishonorèd.

By thee; and this thou didst return from him:

That he did buffet thee and, in his blows,

Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

How ill agrees it with your gravity

To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,

Abetting him to thwart me in my mood.

Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,

But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.

Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine.

Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,

Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,

Makes me with thy strength to communicate.

If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,

Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,

Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion

Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,

To put the finger in the eye and weep

Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.

Come, sir, to dinner.—Dromio, keep the gate.—

Husband, I’ll dine above with you today,

And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.

Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,

Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.—

Come, sister.—Dromio, play the porter well.

Ay, and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?

Your wife, sir knave? Go, get you from the door.

Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?

Might’st thou perceive austerely in his eye

That he did plead in earnest, yea or no?

Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?

What observation mad’st thou in this case

Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?

He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

And what said he?

With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

Did’st speak him fair?

I cannot, nor I will not hold me still.

My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.

He is deformèd, crooked, old, and sere,

Ill-faced, worse-bodied, shapeless everywhere,

Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,

Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

Ah, but I think him better than I say,

And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse.

Far from her nest the lapwing cries away.

My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?

Why, man, what is the matter?

What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

Go fetch it, sister. This I wonder at,

That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.

Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

What, the chain?

The hours come back. That did I never hear.

As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou reason!

Go, Dromio. There’s the money. Bear it straight,

And bring thy master home immediately.

Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit:

Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

His incivility confirms no less.—

Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;

Establish him in his true sense again,

And I will please you what you will demand.

O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul!

O husband, God doth know you dined at home,

Where would you had remained until this time,

Free from these slanders and this open shame.

Is ’t good to soothe him in these contraries?

Alas, I sent you money to redeem you

By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

He came to me, and I delivered it.

I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

Dissembling villain, thou speak’st false in both.

O bind him, bind him! Let him not come near me.

What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?

Hast thou delight to see a wretched man

Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.

Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,

And knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.—

Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed

Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

Go bear him hence.  Sister, go you with me.

Say now whose suit is he arrested at.

I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

Say, how grows it due?

He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not.

It may be so, but I did never see it.—

Come, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is.

I long to know the truth hereof at large.

And come with naked swords. Let’s call more help

To have them bound again.

Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake. He is mad.—

Some get within him; take his sword away.

Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house!

To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.

Let us come in, that we may bind him fast

And bear him home for his recovery.

This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,

And much different from the man he was.

But till this afternoon his passion

Ne’er brake into extremity of rage.

To none of these, except it be the last,

Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

Why, so I did.

As roughly as my modesty would let me.

And in assemblies too.

It was the copy of our conference.

In bed he slept not for my urging it;

At board he fed not for my urging it.

Alone, it was the subject of my theme;

In company I often glancèd it.

Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

She did betray me to my own reproof.—

Good people, enter and lay hold on him.

Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

I will attend my husband, be his nurse,

Diet his sickness, for it is my office

And will have no attorney but myself;

And therefore let me have him home with me.

I will not hence and leave my husband here;

And ill it doth beseem your holiness

To separate the husband and the wife.

Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet

And never rise until my tears and prayers

Have won his grace to come in person hither

And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.

Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess.

May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,

Who I made lord of me and all I had

At your important letters, this ill day

A most outrageous fit of madness took him,

That desp’rately he hurried through the street,

With him his bondman, all as mad as he,

Doing displeasure to the citizens

By rushing in their houses, bearing thence

Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.

Once did I get him bound and sent him home

Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went

That here and there his fury had committed.

Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,

He broke from those that had the guard of him,

And with his mad attendant and himself,

Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,

Met us again and, madly bent on us,

Chased us away, till raising of more aid,

We came again to bind them. Then they fled

Into this abbey, whither we pursued them,

And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us

And will not suffer us to fetch him out,

Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.

Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command

Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

Peace, fool. Thy master and his man are here,

And that is false thou dost report to us.

Ay me, it is my husband. Witness you

That he is borne about invisible.

Even now we housed him in the abbey here,

And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.

No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister

Today did dine together. So befall my soul

As this is false he burdens me withal.

I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

Which of you two did dine with me today?

And are not you my husband?

I sent you money, sir, to be your bail

By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.
