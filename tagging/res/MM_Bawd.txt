carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio.

Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw

him carried away; and, which is more, within these

three days his head to be chopped off.

I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam

Julietta with child.

Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat,

what with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am

custom-shrunk.

How now? What’s the news with you?

Well, what has he done?

But what’s his offense?

What? Is there a maid with child by him?

What proclamation, man?

And what shall become of those in the city?

But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs

be pulled down?

Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth!

What shall become of me?

What’s to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let’s

withdraw.

Good my lord, be good to me. Your Honor is

accounted a merciful man, good my lord.

My lord, this is one Lucio’s information

against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was

with child by him in the Duke’s time; he promised

her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old

come Philip and Jacob. I have kept it myself, and see

how he goes about to abuse me.
