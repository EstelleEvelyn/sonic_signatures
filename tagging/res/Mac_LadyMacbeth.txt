


They met me in the

day of success and I have learned by the perfect'st

report they have more in them than mortal knowledge

When I burned in desire to question them further they

made themselves air into which they vanished

Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives

from the King who all-hailed me Thane of Cawdor

by which title before these Werd Sisters saluted me

and referred me to the coming on of time with Hail

king that shalt be This have I thought good to deliver

thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou

might'st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant

of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy

heart and farewell

Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be

What thou art promised Yet do I fear thy nature

It is too full o' th' milk of human kindness

To catch the nearest way Thou wouldst be great

Art not without ambition but without

The illness should attend it What thou wouldst highly

That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false

And yet wouldst wrongly win Thou 'dst have great Glamis

That which cries Thus thou must do if thou have it

And that which rather thou dost fear to do

Than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither

That I may pour my spirits in thine ear

And chastise with the valor of my tongue

All that impedes thee from the golden round

Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem

To have thee crowned withal   What is your tidings

Thou 'rt mad to say it

Is not thy master with him who were 't so

Would have informed for preparation

Give him tending

He brings great news The raven himself is hoarse

That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan

Under my battlements Come you spirits

That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here

And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full

Of direst cruelty Make thick my blood

Stop up th' access and passage to remorse

That no compunctious visitings of nature

Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between

Th' effect and it Come to my woman's breasts

And take my milk for gall you murd'ring ministers

Wherever in your sightless substances

You wait on nature's mischief Come thick night

And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell

That my keen knife see not the wound it makes

Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark

To cry Hold hold    Great Glamis worthy Cawdor

Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter

Thy letters have transported me beyond

This ignorant present and I feel now

The future in the instant

And when goes hence

O never

Shall sun that morrow see

Your face my thane is as a book where men

May read strange matters To beguile the time

Look like the time Bear welcome in your eye

Your hand your tongue Look like th' innocent flower

But be the serpent under 't He that's coming

Must be provided for and you shall put

This night's great business into my dispatch

Which shall to all our nights and days to come

Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom

Only look up clear

To alter favor ever is to fear

Leave all the rest to me

All our service

In every point twice done and then done double

Were poor and single business to contend

Against those honors deep and broad wherewith

Your Majesty loads our house For those of old

And the late dignities heaped up to them

We rest your hermits

Your servants ever

Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt

To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure

Still to return your own

He has almost supped Why have you left the chamber

Know you not he has

Was the hope drunk

Wherein you dressed yourself Hath it slept since

And wakes it now to look so green and pale

At what it did so freely From this time

Such I account thy love Art thou afeard

To be the same in thine own act and valor

As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that

Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life

And live a coward in thine own esteem

Letting I dare not wait upon I would

Like the poor cat i' th' adage

What beast was 't then

That made you break this enterprise to me

When you durst do it then you were a man

And to be more than what you were you would

Be so much more the man Nor time nor place

Did then adhere and yet you would make both

They have made themselves and that their fitness now

Does unmake you I have given suck and know

How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me

I would while it was smiling in my face

Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums

And dashed the brains out had I so sworn as you

Have done to this

We fail

But screw your courage to the sticking place

And we'll not fail When Duncan is asleep

Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey

Soundly invite him his two chamberlains

Will I with wine and wassail so convince

That memory the warder of the brain

Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason

A limbeck only When in swinish sleep

Their drenchd natures lies as in a death

What cannot you and I perform upon

Th' unguarded Duncan What not put upon

His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt

Of our great quell

Who dares receive it other

As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar

Upon his death

That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold

What hath quenched them hath given me fire HarkPeace

It was the owl that shrieked the fatal bellman

Which gives the stern'st good-night He is about it

The doors are open and the surfeited grooms

Do mock their charge with snores I have drugged their possets

That death and nature do contend about them

Whether they live or die

Alack I am afraid they have awaked

And 'tis not done Th' attempt and not the deed

Confounds us HarkI laid their daggers ready

He could not miss 'em Had he not resembled

My father as he slept I had done 't

My husband

I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry

Did not you speak

Now

Ay

Donalbain

A foolish thought to say a sorry sight

There are two lodged together

Consider it not so deeply

These deeds must not be thought

After these ways so it will make us mad

What do you mean

Who was it that thus cried Why worthy thane

You do unbend your noble strength to think

So brainsickly of things Go get some water

And wash this filthy witness from your hand

Why did you bring these daggers from the place

They must lie there Go carry them and smear

The sleepy grooms with blood

Infirm of purpose

Give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead

Are but as pictures 'Tis the eye of childhood

That fears a painted devil If he do bleed

I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal

For it must seem their guilt

My hands are of your color but I shame

To wear a heart so white I hear a knocking

At the south entry Retire we to our chamber

A little water clears us of this deed

How easy is it then Your constancy

Hath left you unattended Hark more knocking

Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us

And show us to be watchers Be not lost

So poorly in your thoughts

What's the business

That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley

The sleepers of the house Speak speak

Woe alas

What in our house

Help me hence ho

If he had been forgotten

It had been as a gap in our great feast

And all-thing unbecoming

Is Banquo gone from court

Say to the King I would attend his leisure

For a few words

Naught's had all's spent

Where our desire is got without content

'Tis safer to be that which we destroy

Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy

How now my lord why do you keep alone

Of sorriest fancies your companions making

Using those thoughts which should indeed have died

With them they think on Things without all remedy

Should be without regard What's done is done

Come on gentle my lord

Sleek o'er your rugged looks Be bright and jovial

Among your guests tonight

You must leave this

But in them nature's copy's not eterne

What's to be done

Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends

For my heart speaks they are welcome

My royal lord

You do not give the cheer The feast is sold

That is not often vouched while 'tis a-making

'Tis given with welcome To feed were best at home

From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony

Meeting were bare without it

Sit worthy friends My lord is often thus

And hath been from his youth Pray you keep seat

The fit is momentary upon a thought

He will again be well If much you note him

You shall offend him and extend his passion

Feed and regard him not Are you a man

O proper stuff

This is the very painting of your fear

This is the air-drawn dagger which you said

Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts

Impostors to true fear would well become

A woman's story at a winter's fire

Authorized by her grandam Shame itself

Why do you make such faces When all's done

You look but on a stool

What quite unmanned in folly

Fie for shame

My worthy lord

Your noble friends do lack you

Think of this good peers

But as a thing of custom 'Tis no other

Only it spoils the pleasure of the time

You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting

With most admired disorder

I pray you speak not He grows worse and worse

Question enrages him At once good night

Stand not upon the order of your going

But go at once

A kind good night to all

Almost at odds with morning which is which

Did you send to him sir

You lack the season of all natures sleep

Yet here's a spot

Out damned spot out I say One Two

Why then 'tis time to do 't Hell is murky Fie my

lord fie a soldier and afeard What need we fear

who knows it when none can call our power to

account Yet who would have thought the old man

to have had so much blood in him

The Thane of Fife had a wife Where is

she now What will these hands ne'er be clean No

more o' that my lord no more o' that You mar all

with this starting

Here's the smell of the blood still All

the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little

hand O O O

Wash your hands Put on your nightgown

Look not so pale I tell you yet again Banquo's

buried he cannot come out on 's grave

To bed to bed There's knocking at the

gate Come come come come Give me your

hand What's done cannot be undone To bed to

bed to bed
