Tell him that by his license Fortinbras

Craves the conveyance of a promised march

Over his kingdom You know the rendezvous

If that his Majesty would aught with us

We shall express our duty in his eye

And let him know so

Go softly on

Where is this sight

This quarry cries on havoc O proud Death

What feast is toward in thine eternal cell

That thou so many princes at a shot

So bloodily hast struck

Let us haste to hear it

And call the noblest to the audience

For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune

I have some rights of memory in this kingdom

Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me

Let four captains

Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage

For he was likely had he been put on

To have proved most royal and for his passage

The soldier's music and the rite of war

Speak loudly for him

Take up the bodies Such a sight as this

Becomes the field but here shows much amiss

Go bid the soldiers shoot
