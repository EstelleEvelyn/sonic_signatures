


Is my name Talbot And am I your son

And shall I fly O if you love my mother

Dishonor not her honorable name

To make a bastard and a slave of me

The world will say He is not Talbot's blood

That basely fled when noble Talbot stood

He that flies so will ne'er return again

Then let me stay and father do you fly

Your loss is great so your regard should be

My worth unknown no loss is known in me

Upon my death the French can little boast

In yours they will in you all hopes are lost

Flight cannot stain the honor you have won

But mine it will that no exploit have done

You fled for vantage everyone will swear

But if I bow they'll say it was for fear

There is no hope that ever I will stay

If the first hour I shrink and run away

Here on my knee I beg mortality

Rather than life preserved with infamy

Ay rather than I'll shame my mother's womb

To fight I will but not to fly the foe

No part of him but will be shame in me

Yes your renownd name shall flight abuse it

You cannot witness for me being slain

If death be so apparent then both fly

And shall my youth be guilty of such blame

No more can I be severed from your side

Than can yourself yourself in twain divide

Stay go do what you will the like do I

For live I will not if my father die

O twice my father twice am I thy son

The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done

Till with thy warlike sword despite of fate

To my determined time thou gav'st new date

The sword of Orleance hath not made me smart

These words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart

On that advantage bought with such a shame

To save a paltry life and slay bright fame

Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly

The coward horse that bears me fall and die

And like me to the peasant boys of France

To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance

Surely by all the glory you have won

An if I fly I am not Talbot's son

Then talk no more of flight it is no boot

If son to Talbot die at Talbot's foot
