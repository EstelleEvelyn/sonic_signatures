


Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.—

Give me the map there. Know that we have divided

In three our kingdom, and ’tis our fast intent

To shake all cares and business from our age,

Conferring them on younger strengths, while we

Unburdened crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall

And you, our no less loving son of Albany,

We have this hour a constant will to publish

Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife

May be prevented now.

The two great princes, France and Burgundy,

Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,

Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn

And here are to be answered. Tell me, my daughters—

Since now we will divest us both of rule,

Interest of territory, cares of state—

Which of you shall we say doth love us most,

That we our largest bounty may extend

Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,

Our eldest born, speak first.

Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,

With shadowy forests and with champains riched,

With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,

We make thee lady. To thine and Albany’s issue

Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,

Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.

To thee and thine hereditary ever

Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,

No less in space, validity, and pleasure

Than that conferred on Goneril.—Now, our joy,

Although our last and least, to whose young love

The vines of France and milk of Burgundy

Strive to be interessed, what can you say to draw

A third more opulent than your sisters’? Speak.

Nothing?

Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.

How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,

Lest you may mar your fortunes.

But goes thy heart with this?

So young and so untender?

Let it be so. Thy truth, then, be thy dower,

For by the sacred radiance of the sun,

The mysteries of Hecate and the night,

By all the operation of the orbs

From whom we do exist and cease to be,

Here I disclaim all my paternal care,

Propinquity, and property of blood,

And as a stranger to my heart and me

Hold thee from this forever. The barbarous Scythian,

Or he that makes his generation messes

To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom

Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved

As thou my sometime daughter.

Peace, Kent.

Come not between the dragon and his wrath.

I loved her most and thought to set my rest

On her kind nursery. Hence and avoid my sight!—

So be my grave my peace as here I give

Her father’s heart from her.—Call France. Who stirs?

Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,

With my two daughters’ dowers digest the third.

Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.

I do invest you jointly with my power,

Preeminence, and all the large effects

That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,

With reservation of an hundred knights

By you to be sustained, shall our abode

Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain

The name and all th’ addition to a king.

The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,

Belovèd sons, be yours, which to confirm,

This coronet part between you.

The bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft.

Kent, on thy life, no more.

Out of my sight!

Now, by Apollo—

O vassal! Miscreant!

Hear me, recreant; on thine allegiance, hear me!

That thou hast sought to make us break our vows—

Which we durst never yet—and with strained pride

To come betwixt our sentence and our power,

Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,

Our potency made good, take thy reward:

Five days we do allot thee for provision

To shield thee from disasters of the world,

And on the sixth to turn thy hated back

Upon our kingdom. If on the tenth day following

Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions,

The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,

This shall not be revoked.

My lord of Burgundy,

We first address toward you, who with this king

Hath rivaled for our daughter. What in the least

Will you require in present dower with her,

Or cease your quest of love?

Right noble Burgundy,

When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,

But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands.

If aught within that little seeming substance,

Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced

And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,

She’s there, and she is yours.

Will you, with those infirmities she owes,

Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,

Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath,

Take her or leave her?

Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me

I tell you all her wealth.—For you, great king,

I would not from your love make such a stray

To match you where I hate. Therefore beseech you

T’ avert your liking a more worthier way

Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed

Almost t’ acknowledge hers.

Better thou

Hadst not been born than not t’ have pleased me better.

Nothing. I have sworn. I am firm.

Thou hast her, France. Let her be thine, for we

Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see

That face of hers again. Therefore begone

Without our grace, our love, our benison.—

Come, noble Burgundy.

Let me not stay a jot for dinner. Go get it ready.

How now, what art thou?

What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with

us?

What art thou?

If thou be’st as poor for a subject as he’s for a

king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?

Who wouldst thou serve?

Dost thou know me, fellow?

What’s that?

What services canst do?

How old art thou?

Follow me. Thou shalt serve me—if I like thee

no worse after dinner. I will not part from thee

yet.—Dinner, ho, dinner!—Where’s my knave, my

Fool? Go you and call my Fool hither.

You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?

What says the fellow there? Call the clotpole

back. Where’s my Fool? Ho! I think

the world’s asleep.

How now? Where’s that mongrel?

Why came not the slave back to me when I

called him?

He would not?

Ha? Sayst thou so?

Thou but remembrest me of mine own conception.

I have perceived a most faint neglect of late,

which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous

curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of

unkindness. I will look further into ’t. But where’s

my Fool? I have not seen him this two days.

No more of that. I have noted it well.—Go you

and tell my daughter I would speak with her.

Go you call hither my Fool.

O you, sir, you, come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?

“My lady’s father”? My lord’s knave! You whoreson

dog, you slave, you cur!

Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv’st me, and I’ll

love thee.

Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There’s

earnest of thy service.

How now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?

Why, my boy?

Why, my boy?

Take heed, sirrah—the whip.

A pestilent gall to me!

Do.

Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of

nothing.

A bitter Fool!

No, lad, teach me.

Dost thou call me “fool,” boy?

What two crowns shall they be?

When were you wont to be so full of songs,

sirrah?

An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.

How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on?

Methinks you are too much of late i’ th’ frown.

Are you our daughter?

Does any here know me? This is not Lear.

Does Lear walk thus, speak thus? Where are his eyes?

Either his notion weakens, his discernings

Are lethargied—Ha! Waking? ’Tis not so.

Who is it that can tell me who I am?

I would learn that, for, by the marks of sovereignty,

Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded

I had daughters.

Your name, fair gentlewoman?

Darkness and devils!—

Saddle my horses. Call my train together.

Degenerate bastard, I’ll not trouble thee.

Yet have I left a daughter.

Woe that too late repents!—O, sir, are you come?

Is it your will? Speak, sir.—Prepare my horses.

Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,

More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child

Than the sea monster!

Detested kite, thou liest.

My train are men of choice and rarest parts,

That all particulars of duty know

And in the most exact regard support

The worships of their name. O most small fault,

How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show,

Which, like an engine, wrenched my frame of nature

From the fixed place, drew from my heart all love

And added to the gall! O Lear, Lear, Lear!

Beat at this gate that let thy folly in

And thy dear judgment out. Go, go, my people.

It may be so, my lord.—

Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!

Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend

To make this creature fruitful.

Into her womb convey sterility.

Dry up in her the organs of increase,

And from her derogate body never spring

A babe to honor her. If she must teem,

Create her child of spleen, that it may live

And be a thwart disnatured torment to her.

Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,

With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,

Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits

To laughter and contempt, that she may feel

How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is

To have a thankless child.—Away, away!

What, fifty of my followers at a clap?

Within a fortnight?

I’ll tell thee. Life and death! I am ashamed

That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,

That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,

Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!

Th’ untented woundings of a father’s curse

Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,

Beweep this cause again, I’ll pluck you out

And cast you, with the waters that you loose,

To temper clay. Yea, is ’t come to this?

Ha! Let it be so. I have another daughter

Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable.

When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails

She’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find

That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think

I have cast off forever.

Go you before to Gloucester with these

letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything

you know than comes from her demand out of

the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be

there afore you.

Ay, boy.

Ha, ha, ha!

What canst tell, boy?

No.

I did her wrong.

No.

Why?

I will forget my nature. So kind a father!—Be

my horses ready?

Because they are not eight.

To take ’t again perforce! Monster ingratitude!

How’s that?

O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!

Keep me in temper. I would not be mad!

How now, are the horses ready?

Come, boy.

’Tis strange that they should so depart from home

And not send back my messenger.

Ha?

Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?

What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook

To set thee here?

No.

No, I say.

By Jupiter, I swear no.

They durst not do ’t.

They could not, would not do ’t. ’Tis worse than murder

To do upon respect such violent outrage.

Resolve me with all modest haste which way

Thou might’st deserve or they impose this usage,

Coming from us.

O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!

Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow!

Thy element’s below.—Where is this daughter?

Follow me not. Stay here.

Deny to speak with me? They are sick? They are weary?

They have traveled all the night? Mere fetches,

The images of revolt and flying off.

Fetch me a better answer.

Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!

“Fiery”? What “quality”? Why Gloucester, Gloucester,

I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

“Informed them”? Dost thou understand me, man?

The King would speak with Cornwall. The dear father

Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends service.

Are they “informed” of this? My breath and blood!

“Fiery”? The “fiery” duke? Tell the hot duke that—

No, but not yet. Maybe he is not well.

Infirmity doth still neglect all office

Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves

When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind

To suffer with the body. I’ll forbear,

And am fallen out with my more headier will,

To take the indisposed and sickly fit

For the sound man. Death on my state! Wherefore

Should he sit here? This act persuades me

That this remotion of the Duke and her

Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.

Go tell the Duke and ’s wife I’d speak with them.

Now, presently, bid them come forth and hear me,

Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum

Till it cry sleep to death.

O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!

Good morrow to you both.

Regan, I think you are. I know what reason

I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,

I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb,

Sepulch’ring an adult’ress. O, are you free?

Some other time for that.—Belovèd Regan,

Thy sister’s naught. O Regan, she hath tied

Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.

I can scarce speak to thee. Thou ’lt not believe

With how depraved a quality—O Regan!

Say? How is that?

My curses on her.

Ask her forgiveness?

Do you but mark how this becomes the house:

“Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.

Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg

That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.”

Never, Regan.

She hath abated me of half my train,

Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue

Most serpentlike upon the very heart.

All the stored vengeances of heaven fall

On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,

You taking airs, with lameness!

You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames

Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,

You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun

To fall and blister!

No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.

Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give

Thee o’er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but thine

Do comfort and not burn. ’Tis not in thee

To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,

To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,

And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt

Against my coming in. Thou better know’st

The offices of nature, bond of childhood,

Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.

Thy half o’ th’ kingdom hast thou not forgot,

Wherein I thee endowed.

Who put my man i’ th’ stocks?

This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride

Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.—

Out, varlet, from my sight!

Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope

Thou didst not know on ’t.    Who comes here? O heavens,

If you do love old men, if your sweet sway

Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,

Make it your cause. Send down and take my part.

Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?

O Regan, will you take her by the hand?

O sides, you are too tough!

Will you yet hold?—How came my man i’ th’ stocks?

You? Did you?

Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?

No! Rather I abjure all roofs, and choose

To wage against the enmity o’ th’ air,

To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,

Necessity’s sharp pinch. Return with her?

Why the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took

Our youngest born—I could as well be brought

To knee his throne and, squire-like, pension beg

To keep base life afoot. Return with her?

Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter

To this detested groom.

I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.

I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell.

We’ll no more meet, no more see one another.

But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter,

Or, rather, a disease that’s in my flesh,

Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,

A plague-sore or embossèd carbuncle

In my corrupted blood. But I’ll not chide thee.

Let shame come when it will; I do not call it.

I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,

Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.

Mend when thou canst. Be better at thy leisure.

I can be patient. I can stay with Regan,

I and my hundred knights.

Is this well spoken?

I gave you all—

Made you my guardians, my depositaries,

But kept a reservation to be followed

With such a number. What, must I come to you

With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?

Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favored

When others are more wicked. Not being the worst

Stands in some rank of praise. I’ll go with thee.

Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,

And thou art twice her love.

O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars

Are in the poorest thing superfluous.

Allow not nature more than nature needs,

Man’s life is cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady;

If only to go warm were gorgeous,

Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st,

Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need—

You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!

You see me here, you gods, a poor old man

As full of grief as age, wretched in both.

If it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts

Against their father, fool me not so much

To bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger,

And let not women’s weapons, water drops,

Stain my man’s cheeks.—No, you unnatural hags,

I will have such revenges on you both

That all the world shall—I will do such things—

What they are yet I know not, but they shall be

The terrors of the Earth! You think I’ll weep.

No, I’ll not weep.

I have full cause of weeping, but this heart

Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws

Or ere I’ll weep.—O Fool, I shall go mad!

Blow winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!

You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout

Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks.

You sulph’rous and thought-executing fires,

Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,

Singe my white head. And thou, all-shaking thunder,

Strike flat the thick rotundity o’ th’ world.

Crack nature’s molds, all germens spill at once

That makes ingrateful man.

Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!

Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.

I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.

I never gave you kingdom, called you children;

You owe me no subscription. Then let fall

Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,

A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.

But yet I call you servile ministers,

That will with two pernicious daughters join

Your high-engendered battles ’gainst a head

So old and white as this. O, ho, ’tis foul!

No, I will be the pattern of all patience.

I will say nothing.

Let the great gods

That keep this dreadful pudder o’er our heads

Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,

That hast within thee undivulgèd crimes

Unwhipped of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,

Thou perjured, and thou simular of virtue

That art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,

That under covert and convenient seeming

Has practiced on man’s life. Close pent-up guilts,

Rive your concealing continents and cry

These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man

More sinned against than sinning.

My wits begin to turn.—

Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?

I am cold myself.—Where is this straw, my fellow?

The art of our necessities is strange

And can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.—

Poor Fool and knave, I have one part in my heart

That’s sorry yet for thee.

True, my good boy.—Come, bring us to this hovel.

Let me alone.

Wilt break my heart?

Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm

Invades us to the skin. So ’tis to thee.

But where the greater malady is fixed,

The lesser is scarce felt. Thou ’dst shun a bear,

But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,

Thou ’dst meet the bear i’ th’ mouth. When the mind’s free,

The body’s delicate. This tempest in my mind

Doth from my senses take all feeling else

Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!

Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand

For lifting food to ’t? But I will punish home.

No, I will weep no more. In such a night

To shut me out? Pour on. I will endure.

In such a night as this? O Regan, Goneril,

Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all!

O, that way madness lies. Let me shun that;

No more of that.

Prithee, go in thyself. Seek thine own ease.

This tempest will not give me leave to ponder

On things would hurt me more. But I’ll go in.—

In, boy; go first.—You houseless poverty—

Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep.

Poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you are,

That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,

How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,

Your looped and windowed raggedness defend you

From seasons such as these? O, I have ta’en

Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp.

Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,

That thou may’st shake the superflux to them

And show the heavens more just.

Didst thou give all to thy daughters? And art thou

come to this?

Has his daughters brought him to this pass?—

Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give ’em all?

Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air

Hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters!

Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature

To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.

Is it the fashion that discarded fathers

Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?

Judicious punishment! ’Twas this flesh begot

Those pelican daughters.

What hast thou been?

Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with

thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.—Is

man no more than this? Consider him well.—Thou

ow’st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep

no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha, here’s three on ’s

are sophisticated. Thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated

man is no more but such a poor, bare,

forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!

Come, unbutton here.

What’s he?

First let me talk with this philosopher.

What is the cause of thunder?

I’ll talk a word with this same learnèd Theban.—

What is your study?

Let me ask you one word in private.

O, cry you mercy, sir.

Noble philosopher, your company.

Come, let’s in all.

With him.

I will keep still with my philosopher.

Come, good Athenian.

A king, a king!

To have a thousand with red burning spits

Come hissing in upon ’em!

It shall be done. I will arraign them straight.

Come, sit thou here, most learnèd justice.

Thou sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes—

I’ll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.

Thou robèd man of justice, take thy place,

And thou, his yokefellow of equity,

Bench by his side. You are o’ th’ commission;

Sit you, too.

Arraign her first; ’tis Goneril. I here take my oath

before this honorable assembly, kicked the poor

king her father.

She cannot deny it.

And here’s another whose warped looks proclaim

What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!

Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!

False justicer, why hast thou let her ’scape?

The little dogs and all,

Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.

Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds

about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that

make these hard hearts? You, sir, I

entertain for one of my hundred; only I do not like

the fashion of your garments. You will say they are

Persian, but let them be changed.

Make no noise, make no noise.

Draw the curtains. So, so, we’ll go to supper i’ th’

morning.

No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the

King himself.

Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your

press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a

crowkeeper. Draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look,

a mouse! Peace, peace! This piece of toasted cheese

will do ’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a

giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!

I’ th’ clout, i’ th’ clout! Hewgh! Give the word.

Pass.

Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flattered

me like a dog and told me I had the white hairs in

my beard ere the black ones were there. To say “ay”

and “no” to everything that I said “ay” and “no” to

was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me

once and the wind to make me chatter, when the

thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I

found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to. They are

not men o’ their words; they told me I was everything.

’Tis a lie. I am not ague-proof.

Ay, every inch a king.

When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.

I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?

Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.

The wren goes to ’t, and the small gilded fly does

lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for

Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father

than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets. To

’t, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers. Behold yond

simp’ring dame, whose face between her forks

presages snow, that minces virtue and does shake

the head to hear of pleasure’s name. The fitchew

nor the soiled horse goes to ’t with a more riotous

appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs,

though women all above. But to the girdle do the

gods inherit; beneath is all the fiend’s. There’s hell,

there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning,

scalding, stench, consumption! Fie, fie, fie, pah,

pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary;

sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.

Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou

squinny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, I’ll

not love. Read thou this challenge. Mark but the

penning of it.

Read.

O ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your

head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in

a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how

this world goes.

What, art mad? A man may see how this world

goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how

yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in

thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which

is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a

farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?

And the creature run from the cur? There thou

might’st behold the great image of authority: a

dog’s obeyed in office.

Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!

Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back.

Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind

For which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.

Through tattered clothes small vices do appear.

Robes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,

And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.

Arm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it.

None does offend, none, I say, none; I’ll able ’em.

Take that of me, my friend, who have the power

To seal th’ accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,

And like a scurvy politician

Seem to see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now.

Pull off my boots. Harder, harder. So.

If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.

I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.

Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;

Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air

We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.

When we are born, we cry that we are come

To this great stage of fools.—This’ a good block.

It were a delicate stratagem to shoe

A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put ’t in proof,

And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,

Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even

The natural fool of Fortune. Use me well.

You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;

I am cut to th’ brains.

No seconds? All myself?

Why, this would make a man a man of salt,

To use his eyes for garden waterpots,

Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.

I will die bravely like a smug bridegroom. What?

I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king,

Masters, know you that?

Then there’s life in ’t. Come, an you get it, you

shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.

You do me wrong to take me out o’ th’ grave.

Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound

Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears

Do scald like molten lead.

You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die?

Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?

I am mightily abused; I should e’en die with pity

To see another thus. I know not what to say.

I will not swear these are my hands. Let’s see.

I feel this pinprick. Would I were assured

Of my condition!

Pray do not mock:

I am a very foolish fond old man,

Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less,

And to deal plainly,

I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

Methinks I should know you and know this man,

Yet I am doubtful, for I am mainly ignorant

What place this is, and all the skill I have

Remembers not these garments; nor I know not

Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me,

For, as I am a man, I think this lady

To be my child Cordelia.

Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray, weep not.

If you have poison for me, I will drink it.

I know you do not love me, for your sisters

Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.

You have some cause; they have not.

Am I in France?

Do not abuse me.

You must bear with me.

Pray you now, forget, and forgive. I am old and foolish.

No, no, no, no. Come, let’s away to prison.

We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage.

When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down

And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,

And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh

At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues

Talk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too—

Who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out—

And take upon ’s the mystery of things,

As if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out,

In a walled prison, packs and sects of great ones

That ebb and flow by th’ moon.

Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,

The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?

He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven

And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.

The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell,

Ere they shall make us weep. We’ll see ’em starved first.

Come.

Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!

Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so

That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone forever.

I know when one is dead and when one lives.

She’s dead as earth.—Lend me a looking glass.

If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,

Why, then she lives.

This feather stirs. She lives. If it be so,

It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows

That ever I have felt.

Prithee, away.

A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!

I might have saved her. Now she’s gone forever.—

Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!

What is ’t thou sayst?—Her voice was ever soft,

Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.

I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.

Did I not, fellow?

I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion

I would have made him skip. I am old now,

And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?

Mine eyes are not o’ th’ best. I’ll tell you straight.

This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that.

He’ll strike and quickly too. He’s dead and rotten.

I’ll see that straight.

You are welcome hither.

Ay, so I think.

And my poor fool is hanged. No, no, no life?

Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,

And thou no breath at all? Thou ’lt come no more,

Never, never, never, never, never.—

Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.

Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,

Look there, look there!
