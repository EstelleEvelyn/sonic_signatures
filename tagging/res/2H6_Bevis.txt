


Come and get thee a sword though made of a

lath They have been up these two days

I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress

the commonwealth and turn it and set a new nap

upon it

O miserable age Virtue is not regarded in

handicraftsmen

Nay more the King's Council are no good

workmen

Thou hast hit it for there's no better sign of a

brave mind than a hard hand

He shall have the skins of our enemies to make

dog's leather of

Then is sin struck down like an ox and iniquity's

throat cut like a calf

Argo their thread of life is spun

God save your Majesty

He hath confessed Away with him He's a villain

and a traitor

Ay marry will we Therefore get you gone

No no and therefore we'll have his head

O brave

God save the King God save the King

We'll follow Cade We'll follow Cade

 Clifford  Clifford We'll follow the King and Clifford
