


Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance

You are a lover Borrow Cupid's wings

And soar with them above a common bound

And to sink in it should you burden love

Too great oppression for a tender thing

If love be rough with you be rough with love

Prick love for pricking and you beat love down

Give me a case to put my visage in

A visor for a visor What care I

What curious eye doth cote deformities

Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me

Tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word

If thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire

Or save your reverence lovewherein thou stickest

Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho

I mean sir in delay

We waste our lights in vain light lights by day

Take our good meaning for our judgment sits

Five times in that ere once in our five wits

Why may one ask

And so did I

That dreamers often lie

O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you

She is the fairies' midwife and she comes

In shape no bigger than an agate stone

On the forefinger of an alderman

Drawn with a team of little atomi

Over men's noses as they lie asleep

Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs

The cover of the wings of grasshoppers

Her traces of the smallest spider web

Her collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams

Her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film

Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat

Not half so big as a round little worm

Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid

Her chariot is an empty hazelnut

Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub

Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers

And in this state she gallops night by night

Through lovers' brains and then they dream of love

On courtiers' knees that dream on cur'sies straight

O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees

O'er ladies' lips who straight on kisses dream

Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues

Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are

Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose

And then dreams he of smelling out a suit

And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail

Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep

Then he dreams of another benefice

Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck

And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats

Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades

Of healths five fathom deep and then anon

Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes

And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two

And sleeps again This is that very Mab

That plats the manes of horses in the night

And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs

Which once untangled much misfortune bodes

This is the hag when maids lie on their backs

That presses them and learns them first to bear

Making them women of good carriage

This is she

True I talk of dreams

Which are the children of an idle brain

Begot of nothing but vain fantasy

Which is as thin of substance as the air

And more inconstant than the wind who woos

Even now the frozen bosom of the north

And being angered puffs away from thence

Turning his side to the dew-dropping south

He is wise

And on my life hath stol'n him home to bed

Nay I'll conjure too

Romeo Humors Madman Passion Lover

Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh

Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied

Cry but Ay me pronounce but love and dove

Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word

One nickname for her purblind son and heir

Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so trim

When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid

He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not

The ape is dead and I must conjure him

I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes

By her high forehead and her scarlet lip

By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh

And the demesnes that there adjacent lie

That in thy likeness thou appear to us

This cannot anger him 'Twould anger him

To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle

Of some strange nature letting it there stand

Till she had laid it and conjured it down

That were some spite My invocation

Is fair and honest In his mistress' name

I conjure only but to raise up him

If love be blind love cannot hit the mark

Now will he sit under a medlar tree

And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit

As maids call medlars when they laugh alone

O Romeo that she were O that she were

An open-arse thou a pop'rin pear

Romeo good night I'll to my truckle bed

This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep

Come shall we go

Where the devil should this Romeo be

Came he not home tonight

Why that same pale hard-hearted wench that Rosaline

Torments him so that he will sure run mad

A challenge on my life

Any man that can write may answer a letter

Alas poor Romeo he is already dead

stabbed with a white wench's black eye run

through the ear with a love-song the very pin of his

heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt shaft And

is he a man to encounter Tybalt

More than prince of cats O he's the courageous

captain of compliments He fights as you sing

prick-song keeps time distance and proportion

He rests his minim rests one two and the third in

your bosomthe very butcher of a silk button a

duelist a duelist a gentleman of the very first house

of the first and second cause Ah the immortal

passado the punto reverso the hay

The pox of such antic lisping affecting

phantasimes these new tuners of accent By

Jesu a very good blade A very tall man A very good

whore Why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire

that we should be thus afflicted with these

strange flies these fashion-mongers these  's

who stand so much on the new form

that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench O their

bones their bones

Without his roe like a dried herring O

flesh flesh how art thou fishified Now is he for the

numbers that Petrarch flowed in Laura to his lady

was a kitchen wench marry she had a better love

to berhyme her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gypsy

Helen and Hero hildings and harlots Thisbe a gray

eye or so but not to the purposeSignior Romeo

bonjour There's a French salutation to your French

slop You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night

The slip sir the slip Can you not conceive

That's as much as to say such a case as

yours constrains a man to bow in the hams

Thou hast most kindly hit it

Nay I am the very pink of courtesy

Right

Sure wit follow me this jest now till thou

hast worn out thy pump that when the single sole

of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing

solely singular

Come between us good Benvolio My wits

faints

Nay if our wits run the wild-goose chase I

am done for thou hast more of the wild goose in

one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole

five Was I with you there for the goose

I will bite thee by the ear for that jest

Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most

sharp sauce

O here's a wit of cheveril that stretches

from an inch narrow to an ell broad

Why is not this better now than groaning

for love Now art thou sociable now art thou

Romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as

by nature For this driveling love is like a great

natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his

bauble in a hole

Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against

the hair

O thou art deceived I would have made it

short for I was come to the whole depth of my tale

and meant indeed to occupy the argument no

longer

Two twoa shirt and a smock

Good Peter to hide her face for her fan's

the fairer face

God you good e'en fair gentlewoman

'Tis no less I tell you for the bawdy hand of

the dial is now upon the prick of noon

Yea is the worst well Very well took i'

faith wisely wisely

A bawd a bawd a bawd So ho

No hare sir unless a hare sir in a Lenten

pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent

An old hare hoar

And an old hare hoar

Is very good meat in Lent

But a hare that is hoar

Is too much for a score

When it hoars ere it be spent

Romeo will you come to your father's We'll to

dinner thither

Farewell ancient lady Farewell lady lady

lady

Thou art like one of these fellows that when

he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his

sword upon the table and says God send me no

need of thee and by the operation of the second

cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is

no need

Come come thou art as hot a jack in thy

mood as any in Italy and as soon moved to be

moody and as soon moody to be moved

Nay an there were two such we should

have none shortly for one would kill the other

Thouwhy thou wilt quarrel with a man that

hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than

thou hast Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking

nuts having no other reason but because thou

hast hazel eyes What eye but such an eye would spy

out such a quarrel Thy head is as full of quarrels as

an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been

beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling Thou hast

quarreled with a man for coughing in the street

because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain

asleep in the sun Didst thou not fall out with a tailor

for wearing his new doublet before Easter With

another for tying his new shoes with old ribbon

And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling

The fee simple O simple

By my heel I care not

And but one word with one of us Couple it

with something Make it a word and a blow

Could you not take some occasion without

giving

Consort What dost thou make us minstrels

An thou make minstrels of us look to hear

nothing but discords Here's my fiddlestick here's

that shall make you dance Zounds consort

Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze

I will not budge for no man's pleasure I

But I'll be hanged sir if he wear your livery

Marry go before to field he'll be your follower

Your Worship in that sense may call him man

O calm dishonorable vile submission

Alla stoccato carries it away

Tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk

Good king of cats nothing but one of your

nine lives that I mean to make bold withal and as

you shall use me hereafter dry-beat the rest of the

eight Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher

by the ears Make haste lest mine be about your

ears ere it be out

Come sir your passado

I am hurt

A plague o' both houses I am sped

Is he gone and hath nothing

Ay ay a scratch a scratch Marry 'tis enough

Where is my pageGo villain fetch a surgeon

No 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as

a church door but 'tis enough 'Twill serve Ask for

am peppered I warrant for this world A plague o'

both your houses Zounds a dog a rat a mouse a

cat to scratch a man to death A braggart a rogue a

villain that fights by the book of arithmetic Why the

devil came you between us I was hurt under your

arm

Help me into some house Benvolio

Or I shall faint A plague o' both your houses
