Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,

Expedient manage must be made, my liege,

Ere further leisure yield them further means

For their advantage and your Highness’ loss.

Amen!

God save your Majesty!—And well met, gentlemen.

I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland.

That he, our hope, might have retired his power

And driven into despair an enemy’s hope,

Who strongly hath set footing in this land.

The banished Bolingbroke repeals himself

And with uplifted arms is safe arrived

At Ravenspurgh.

Ah, madam, ’tis too true. And that is worse,

The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy,

The Lords of Ross, Beaumont, and Willoughby,

With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.

We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester

Hath broken his staff, resigned his stewardship,

And all the Household servants fled with him

To Bolingbroke.

Here comes the Duke of York.

Besides, our nearness to the King in love

Is near the hate of those love not the King.

Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.

The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.

Alas, poor duke, the task he undertakes

Is numb’ring sands and drinking oceans dry.

Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.

Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.

My comfort is that heaven will take our souls

And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
