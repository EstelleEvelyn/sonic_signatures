Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.

Help, grandsire, help! My aunt Lavinia

Follows me everywhere, I know not why.—

Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes!—

Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.

Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.

My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,

Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;

For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,

Extremity of griefs would make men mad,

And I have read that Hecuba of Troy

Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear,

Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt

Loves me as dear as e’er my mother did,

And would not but in fury fright my youth,

Which made me down to throw my books and fly,

Causeless, perhaps.—But pardon me, sweet aunt.

And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,

I will most willingly attend your Ladyship.

Grandsire, ’tis Ovid’s Metamorphosis.

My mother gave it me.

I say, my lord, that if I were a man,

Their mother’s bedchamber should not be safe

For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.

And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.

Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.

My lords, with all the humbleness I may,

I greet your Honors from Andronicus—

And pray the Roman gods confound you both.

That you are both deciphered, that’s the news,

For villains marked with rape.—May it please you,

My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me

The goodliest weapons of his armory

To gratify your honorable youth,

The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say,

And so I do, and with his gifts present

Your Lordships, that, whenever you have need,

You may be armèd and appointed well,

And so I leave you both—like bloody villains.

O grandsire, grandsire, ev’n with all my heart

Would I were dead so you did live again!

O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping.

My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.
