


You shall find of the King a husband madam

you sir a father He that so generally is at all times

good must of necessity hold his virtue to you

whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted

rather than lack it where there is such abundance

He hath abandoned his physicians madam

under whose practices he hath persecuted time

with hope and finds no other advantage in the

process but only the losing of hope by time

How called you the man you speak of

madam

He was excellent indeed madam The King

very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly

He was skillful enough to have lived still if

knowledge could be set up against mortality

A fistula my lord

I would it were not notoriousWas this gentlewoman

the daughter of Gerard de Narbon

Your commendations madam get from her

tears

Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead

excessive grief the enemy to the living

How understand we that

He cannot want the best that shall

Attend his love

Farewell pretty lady You must hold the credit

of your father

Pardon my lord for me and for my tidings

Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon

I would you had kneeled my lord to ask me mercy

And that at my bidding you could so stand up

Good faith across

But my good lord 'tis thus will you be cured

Of your infirmity

O will you eat

No grapes my royal fox Yes but you will

My noble grapes an if my royal fox

Could reach them I have seen a medicine

That's able to breathe life into a stone

Quicken a rock and make you dance canary

With sprightly fire and motion whose simple touch

Is powerful to araise King Pippen nay

To give great Charlemagne a pen in 's hand

And write to her a love line

Why Doctor She My lord there's one arrived

If you will see her Now by my faith and honor

If seriously I may convey my thoughts

In this my light deliverance I have spoke

With one that in her sex her years profession

Wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more

Than I dare blame my weakness Will you see her

For that is her demandand know her business

That done laugh well at me

Nay I'll fit you

And not be all day neither

Nay come your ways

Nay come your ways

This is his Majesty Say your mind to him

A traitor you do look like but such traitors

His Majesty seldom fears I am Cressid's uncle

That dare leave two together Fare you well

They say miracles are past and we have our

philosophical persons to make modern and familiar

things supernatural and causeless Hence is it

that we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves

into seeming knowledge when we should

submit ourselves to an unknown fear

To be relinquished of the artists

Of all the learned and authentic fellows

That gave him out incurable

Not to be helped

Uncertain life and sure death

I may truly say it is a novelty to the world

A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly

actor

Why your dolphin is not lustier 'Fore me I

speak in respect

Very hand of heaven

In a most weak

Generally thankful

Lustig as the Dutchman says I'll like a maid

the better whilst I have a tooth in my head Why

he's able to lead her a coranto

'Fore God I think so

I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture

My mouth no more were broken than these boys'

And writ as little beard

I had rather be in this choice than

throw ambs-ace for my life

Do all they deny her An they were sons

of mine I'd have them whipped or I would send

them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of

These boys are boys of ice they'll none

have her Sure they are bastards to the English

the French ne'er got 'em

There's one grape yet I am sure thy

father drunk wine But if thou be'st not an ass I

am a youth of fourteen I have known thee already

Do you hear monsieur A word with you

Your lord and master did well to make his

recantation

Ay Is it not a language I speak

Are you companion to the Count Rossillion

To what is count's man Count's master is of

another style

I must tell thee sirrah I write man to which

title age cannot bring thee

I did think thee for two ordinaries to be a

pretty wise fellow thou didst make tolerable vent

of thy travel it might pass Yet the scarves and the

bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me

from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden

I have now found thee When I lose thee again I

care not Yet art thou good for nothing but taking

up and that thou 'rt scarce worth

Do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou

hasten thy trial which ifLord have mercy on

thee for a hen So my good window of lattice fare

thee well thy casement I need not open for I look

through thee Give me thy hand

Ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it

Yes good faith ev'ry dram of it and I will not

bate thee a scruple

Ev'n as soon as thou canst for thou hast to

pull at a smack o' th' contrary If ever thou be'st

bound in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find

what it is to be proud of thy bondage I have a

desire to hold my acquaintance with thee or

rather my knowledge that I may say in the default

He is a man I know

I would it were hell pains for thy sake and my

poor doing eternal for doing I am past as I will by

thee in what motion age will give me leave

Sirrah your lord and master's married There's

news for you you have a new mistress

Who God

The devil it is that's thy master Why dost thou

garter up thy arms o' this fashion Dost make hose

of thy sleeves Do other servants so Thou wert

best set thy lower part where thy nose stands By

mine honor if I were but two hours younger I'd

beat thee Methink'st thou art a general offense

and every man should beat thee I think thou wast

created for men to breathe themselves upon thee

Go to sir You were beaten in Italy for picking a

kernel out of a pomegranate You are a vagabond

and no true traveler You are more saucy with

lords and honorable personages than the commission

of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry

You are not worth another word else I'd call you

knave I leave you

But I hope your Lordship thinks not him a

soldier

You have it from his own deliverance

Then my dial goes not true I took this lark for

a bunting

I have then sinned against his experience and

transgressed against his valor and my state that

way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my

heart to repent Here he comes I pray you make us

friends I will pursue the amity

Pray you sir who's his tailor

O I know him well Ay sir he sir 's a good

workman a very good tailor

A good traveler is something at the latter

end of a dinner but one that lies three thirds

and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings

with should be once heard and thrice beaten

God save you captain

You have made shift to run into 't boots and

spurs and all like him that leapt into the custard

and out of it you'll run again rather than suffer

question for your residence

And shall do so ever though I took him at 's

prayers Fare you well my lord and believe this of

me there can be no kernel in this light nut The

soul of this man is his clothes Trust him not in

matter of heavy consequence I have kept of them

tame and know their naturesFarewell monsieur

I have spoken better of you than you have or

will to deserve at my hand but we must do good

against evil

No no no your son was misled with a

snipped-taffeta fellow there whose villainous saffron

would have made all the unbaked and doughy

youth of a nation in his color Your daughter-in-law

had been alive at this hour and your son here

at home more advanced by the King than by that

red-tailed humble-bee I speak of

'Twas a good lady 'twas a good lady We may

pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another

herb

They are not herbs you knave They are

nose-herbs

Whether dost thou profess thyself a knave or a

fool

Your distinction

So you were a knave at his service indeed

I will subscribe for thee thou art both knave

and fool

No no no

Who's that a Frenchman

What prince is that

Hold thee there's my

purse I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy

master thou talk'st of Serve him still

Go thy ways I begin to be aweary of thee And

I tell thee so before because I would not fall out

with thee Go thy ways Let my horses be well

looked to without any tricks

A shrewd knave and an unhappy

I like him well 'Tis not amiss And I was about

to tell you since I heard of the good lady's death

and that my lord your son was upon his return

home I moved the King my master to speak in the

behalf of my daughter which in the minority of

them both his Majesty out of a self-gracious

remembrance did first propose His Highness hath

promised me to do it and to stop up the displeasure

he hath conceived against your son there is

no fitter matter How does your Ladyship like it

His Highness comes post from Marseilles of

as able body as when he numbered thirty He will

be here tomorrow or I am deceived by him that in

such intelligence hath seldom failed

Madam I was thinking with what manners I

might safely be admitted

Lady of that I have made a bold charter But I

thank my God it holds yet

A scar nobly got or a noble scar is a good liv'ry

of honor So belike is that

Let us go see your son I pray you I long to talk

with the young noble soldier

And what would you have me to do 'Tis too

late to pare her nails now Wherein have you

played the knave with Fortune that she should

scratch you who of herself is a good lady and

would not have knaves thrive long under her

There's a cardecu for you Let the justices make

you and Fortune friends I am for other business

You beg a single penny more Come you shall

ha 't Save your word

You beg more than a word then Cock's my

passion give me your hand How does your drum

Was I in sooth And I was the first that lost

thee

Out upon thee knave Dost thou put upon me

at once both the office of God and the devil One

brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out

The King's coming I know by

his trumpets Sirrah inquire further after me I

had talk of you last night Though you are a fool

and a knave you shall eat Go to follow

This I must say

But first I beg my pardon the young lord

Did to his Majesty his mother and his lady

Offense of mighty note but to himself

The greatest wrong of all He lost a wife

Whose beauty did astonish the survey

Of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive

Whose dear perfection hearts that scorned to serve

Humbly called mistress

All that he is hath reference to your Highness

He looks well on 't

Come on my son in whom my house's name

Must be digested give a favor from you

To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter

That she may quickly come  By my old beard

And ev'ry hair that's on 't Helen that's dead

Was a sweet creature Such a ring as this

The last that e'er I took her leave at court

I saw upon her finger

I am sure I saw her wear it

I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair and toll for

this I'll none of him

Your reputation comes too short

for my daughter You are no husband for her

I saw the man today if man he be

He's a good drum my lord but a naughty

orator

This woman's an easy glove my lord she goes

off and on at pleasure

Mine eyes smell onions I shall weep anon

Good Tom Drum lend me a handkercher

So I thank thee Wait on me home

I'll make sport with thee Let thy courtesies alone

They are scurvy ones
