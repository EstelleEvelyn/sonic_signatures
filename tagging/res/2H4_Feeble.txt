A woman's tailor sir

I will do my good will sir You can have no

more

I would Wart might have gone sir

It shall suffice sir

By my troth I care not A man can die but

once We owe God a death I'll ne'er bear a base

mind An 't be my destiny so an 't be not so No

man's too good to serve 's prince and let it go

which way it will he that dies this year is quit for

the next

Faith I'll bear no base mind
