Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent

noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than

thou art.

We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.

This wide-chopped rascal—would thou

mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!

Let’s all sink wi’ th’ King.

The visitor will not give him o’er so.

Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue.

Which, of he or Adrian,

for a good wager, first begins to crow?

The cockerel.

A laughter.

Ha, ha, ha.

He could not miss ’t.

Temperance was a delicate wench.

Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.

True, save means to live.

The ground indeed is tawny.

He misses not much.

If but one of his pockets could speak, would

it not say he lies?

Widow? A pox o’ that! How came that “widow”

in? Widow Dido!

His word is more than the miraculous harp.

What impossible matter will he make easy

next?

And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring

forth more islands.

Why, in good time.

And the rarest that e’er came there.

O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.

That “sort” was well fished for.

And most chirurgeonly.

Very foul.

He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.

The latter end of his commonwealth forgets

the beginning.

None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.

Long live Gonzalo!

’Twas you we laughed at.

What a blow was there given!

Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

Go sleep, and hear us.

We two, my lord,

Will guard your person while you take your rest,

And watch your safety.

It is the quality o’ th’ climate.

Nor I. My spirits are nimble.

They fell together all, as by consent.

They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might,

Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more.

And yet methinks I see it in thy face

What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee, and

My strong imagination sees a crown

Dropping upon thy head.

Do you not hear me speak?

Noble Sebastian,

Thou let’st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink’st

Whiles thou art waking.

I am more serious than my custom. You

Must be so too, if heed me; which to do

Trebles thee o’er.

I’ll teach you how to flow.

O,

If you but knew how you the purpose cherish

Whiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it

You more invest it. Ebbing men indeed

Most often do so near the bottom run

By their own fear or sloth.

Thus, sir:

Although this lord of weak remembrance—this,

Who shall be of as little memory

When he is earthed—hath here almost persuaded—

For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only

Professes to persuade—the King his son’s alive,

’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned

As he that sleeps here swims.

O, out of that no hope

What great hope have you! No hope that way is

Another way so high a hope that even

Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,

But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me

That Ferdinand is drowned?

Then tell me,

Who’s the next heir of Naples?

She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells

Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples

Can have no note, unless the sun were post—

The man i’ th’ moon’s too slow—till newborn chins

Be rough and razorable; she that from whom

We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again,

And by that destiny to perform an act

Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come

In yours and my discharge.

A space whose ev’ry cubit

Seems to cry out “How shall that Claribel

Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis

And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death

That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse

Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples

As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate

As amply and unnecessarily

As this Gonzalo. I myself could make

A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore

The mind that I do, what a sleep were this

For your advancement! Do you understand me?

And how does your content

Tender your own good fortune?

True,

And look how well my garments sit upon me,

Much feater than before. My brother’s servants

Were then my fellows; now they are my men.

Ay, sir, where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,

’Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not

This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences

That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they

And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,

No better than the earth he lies upon.

If he were that which now he’s like—that’s dead—

Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,

Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,

To the perpetual wink for aye might put

This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who

Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,

They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.

They’ll tell the clock to any business that

We say befits the hour.

Draw together,

And when I rear my hand, do you the like

To fall it on Gonzalo.

Then let us both be sudden.

O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,

To make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar

Of a whole herd of lions.

I am right glad that he’s so out of hope.

Do not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose

That you resolved t’ effect.

Let it be tonight;

For now they are oppressed with travel, they

Will not nor cannot use such vigilance

As when they are fresh.

I’ll believe both;

And what does else want credit, come to me

And I’ll be sworn ’tis true. Travelers ne’er did lie,

Though fools at home condemn ’em.

I’ll be thy second.

Very like. One of them

Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable.
