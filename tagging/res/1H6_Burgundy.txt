


Traitors have never other company

But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure

Pray God she prove not masculine ere long

If underneath the standard of the French

She carry armor as she hath begun

And I to this

Myself as far as I could well discern

For smoke and dusky vapors of the night

Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull

When arm-in-arm they both came swiftly running

Like to a pair of loving turtledoves

That could not live asunder day or night

After that things are set in order here

We'll follow them with all the power we have

Is it even so Nay then I see our wars

Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport

When ladies crave to be encountered with

You may not my lord despise her gentle suit

Scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtesan

I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own

And make thee curse the harvest of that corn

My vows are equal partners with thy vows

Courageous Bedford let us now persuade you

Warlike and martial Talbot Burgundy

Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects

Thy noble deeds as valor's monuments

What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy

Who craves a parley with the Burgundy

What say'st thou Charlesfor I am marching hence

Speak on but be not over-tedious

Either she hath bewitched me with her words

Or nature makes me suddenly relent

I am vanquishd These haughty words of hers

Have battered me like roaring cannon-shot

And made me almost yield upon my knees

Forgive me country and sweet countrymen

And lords accept this hearty kind embrace

My forces and my power of men are yours

So farewell Talbot I'll no longer trust thee

Doubtless he would have made a noble knight

See where he lies inhearsd in the arms

Of the most bloody nurser of his harms

I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there

Now he is gone my lord you need not fear
