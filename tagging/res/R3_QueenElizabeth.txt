


If he were dead, what would betide on me?

The loss of such a lord includes all harms.

Ah, he is young, and his minority

Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,

A man that loves not me nor none of you.

It is determined, not concluded yet;

But so it must be if the King miscarry.

The Countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby,

To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.

Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wife

And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured

I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

Saw you the King today, my lord of Derby?

What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

God grant him health. Did you confer with him?

Would all were well—but that will never be.

I fear our happiness is at the height.

Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.

The King, on his own royal disposition,

And not provoked by any suitor else,

Aiming belike at your interior hatred

That in your outward action shows itself

Against my children, brothers, and myself,

Makes him to send, that he may learn the ground.

Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester.

You envy my advancement, and my friends’.

God grant we never may have need of you.

By Him that raised me to this careful height

From that contented hap which I enjoyed,

I never did incense his Majesty

Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been

An earnest advocate to plead for him.

My lord, you do me shameful injury

Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

My lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne

Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.

By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty

Of those gross taunts that oft I have endured.

I had rather be a country servant-maid

Than a great queen with this condition,

To be so baited, scorned, and stormèd at.

Small joy have I in being England’s queen.

As little joy, my lord, as you suppose

You should enjoy were you this country’s king,

As little joy you may suppose in me

That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

So just is God to right the innocent.

Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

I never did her any, to my knowledge.

Catesby, I come.—Lords, will you go with me?

There, Hastings, I will never more remember

Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine.

A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.

I would to God all strifes were well compounded.

My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness

To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!

Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,

To chide my fortune and torment myself?

I’ll join with black despair against my soul

And to myself become an enemy.

To make an act of tragic violence.

Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.

Why grow the branches when the root is gone?

Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?

If you will live, lament. If die, be brief,

That our swift-wingèd souls may catch the King’s,

Or, like obedient subjects, follow him

To his new kingdom of ne’er-changing night.

Give me no help in lamentation.

I am not barren to bring forth complaints.

All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,

That I, being governed by the watery moon,

May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.

Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

What stay had I but Edward? And he’s gone.

Was never widow had so dear a loss.

But I hear no; they say my son of York

Has almost overta’en him in his growth.

A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd.

Pitchers have ears.

How doth the Prince?

Ay me! I see the ruin of my house.

The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind.

Insulting tyranny begins to jut

Upon the innocent and aweless throne.

Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre.

I see, as in a map, the end of all.

Come, come, my boy. We will to sanctuary.—

Madam, farewell.

You have no cause.

As much to you, good sister. Whither away?

Kind sister, thanks. We’ll enter all together.

And in good time here the Lieutenant comes.—

Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,

How doth the Prince and my young son of York?

The King? Who’s that?

The Lord protect him from that kingly title!

Hath he set bounds between their love and me?

I am their mother. Who shall bar me from them?

Ah, cut my lace asunder

That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,

Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!

O Dorset, speak not to me. Get thee gone.

Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels.

Thy mother’s name is ominous to children.

If thou wilt outstrip death, go, cross the seas,

And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.

Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughterhouse,

Lest thou increase the number of the dead

And make me die the thrall of Margaret’s curse,

Nor mother, wife, nor England’s counted queen.

Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory.

To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.

Poor heart, adieu. I pity thy complaining.

Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.—

Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes

Whom envy hath immured within your walls—

Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.

Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow

For tender princes, use my babies well.

So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.

Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes,

My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets,

If yet your gentle souls fly in the air

And be not fixed in doom perpetual,

Hover about me with your airy wings

And hear your mother’s lamentation.

Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs

And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?

When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave

As thou canst yield a melancholy seat,

Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.

Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?

O, thou didst prophesy the time would come

That I should wish for thee to help me curse

That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!

O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile,

And teach me how to curse mine enemies.

My words are dull. O, quicken them with thine!

Windy attorneys to their clients’ woes,

Airy succeeders of intestate joys,

Poor breathing orators of miseries,

Let them have scope; though what they will impart

Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.

Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown

Where should be branded, if that right were right,

The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown

And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?

Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?

Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse

Abides in me. I say amen to her.

I have no more sons of the royal blood

For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,

They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,

And therefore level not to hit their lives.

And must she die for this? O, let her live,

And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,

Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed,

Throw over her the veil of infamy.

So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,

I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.

To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.

And only in that safety died her brothers.

No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.

True, when avoided grace makes destiny.

My babes were destined to a fairer death

If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.

Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened

Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.

Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts,

Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.

No doubt the murd’rous knife was dull and blunt

Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,

To revel in the entrails of my lambs.

But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,

My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys

Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes,

And I, in such a desp’rate bay of death,

Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,

Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

What good is covered with the face of heaven,

To be discovered, that can do me good?

Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.

Flatter my sorrow with report of it.

Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor,

Canst thou demise to any child of mine?

Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness

Last longer telling than thy kindness’ date.

My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.

That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.

So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers,

And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it.

Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

What, thou?

How canst thou woo her?

And wilt thou learn of me?

Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,

A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave

“Edward” and “York.” Then haply will she weep.

Therefore present to her—as sometime Margaret

Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland’s blood—

A handkerchief, which say to her did drain

The purple sap from her sweet brother’s body,

And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.

If this inducement move her not to love,

Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;

Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence,

Her uncle Rivers, ay, and for her sake

Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

There is no other way,

Unless thou couldst put on some other shape

And not be Richard, that hath done all this.

Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,

Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

What were I best to say? Her father’s brother

Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?

Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?

Under what title shall I woo for thee,

That God, the law, my honor, and her love

Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.

That, at her hands, which the King’s King forbids.

To vail the title, as her mother doth.

But how long shall that title “ever” last?

But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?

As long as hell and Richard likes of it.

But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

O no, my reasons are too deep and dead—

Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.

Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

Profaned, dishonored, and the third usurped.

By nothing, for this is no oath.

Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honor;

Thy Garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;

Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.

If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,

Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.

Thyself is self-misused.

’Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

Thy life hath it dishonored.

God’s wrong is most of all.

If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,

The unity the King my husband made

Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.

If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him,

Th’ imperial metal circling now thy head

Had graced the tender temples of my child,

And both the Princes had been breathing here,

Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,

Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.

What canst thou swear by now?

That thou hast wrongèd in the time o’erpast;

For I myself have many tears to wash

Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.

The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered,

Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age;

The parents live whose children thou hast butchered,

Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.

Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast

Misused ere used, by times ill-used o’erpast.

Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

Shall I forget myself to be myself?

Yet thou didst kill my children.

Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

I go. Write to me very shortly,

And you shall understand from me her mind.
