


Go bind thou up young dangling apricokes

Which like unruly children make their sire

Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight

Give some supportance to the bending twigs

Go thou and like an executioner

Cut off the heads of -fast-growing sprays

That look too lofty in our commonwealth

All must be even in our government

You thus employed I will go root away

The noisome weeds which without profit suck

The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers

Hold thy peace

He that hath suffered this disordered spring

Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf

The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter

That seemed in eating him to hold him up

Are plucked up root and all by Bolingbroke

I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green

They are And Bolingbroke

Hath seized the wasteful king O what pity is it

That he had not so trimmed and dressed his land

As we this garden We at time of year

Do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees

Lest being overproud in sap and blood

With too much riches it confound itself

Had he done so to great and growing men

They might have lived to bear and he to taste

Their fruits of duty Superfluous branches

We lop away that bearing boughs may live

Had he done so himself had borne the crown

Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down

Depressed he is already and deposed

'Tis doubt he will be Letters came last night

To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's

That tell black tidings

Pardon me madam Little joy have I

To breathe this news yet what I say is true

King Richard he is in the mighty hold

Of Bolingbroke Their fortunes both are weighed

In your lord's scale is nothing but himself

And some few vanities that make him light

But in the balance of great Bolingbroke

Besides himself are all the English peers

And with that odds he weighs King Richard down

Post you to London and you will find it so

I speak no more than everyone doth know

Poor queen so that thy state might be no worse

I would my skill were subject to thy curse

Here did she fall a tear Here in this place

I'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace

Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen

In the remembrance of a weeping queen
