


Set down set down your honorable load

If honor may be shrouded in a hearse

Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament

Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster

Poor key-cold figure of a holy king

Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster

Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood

Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost

To hear the lamentations of poor Anne

Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughtered son

Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds

Lo in these windows that let forth thy life

I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes

O cursd be the hand that made these holes

Cursd the heart that had the heart to do it

Cursd the blood that let this blood from hence

More direful hap betide that hated wretch

That makes us wretched by the death of thee

Than I can wish to wolves to spiders toads

Or any creeping venomed thing that lives

If ever he have child abortive be it

Prodigious and untimely brought to light

Whose ugly and unnatural aspect

May fright the hopeful mother at the view

And that be heir to his unhappiness

If ever he have wife let her be made

More miserable by the death of him

Than I am made by my young lord and thee

Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load

Taken from Paul's to be interrd there

And still as you are weary of this weight

Rest you whiles I lament King Henry's corse

What black magician conjures up this fiend

To stop devoted charitable deeds

What do you tremble Are you all afraid

Alas I blame you not for you are mortal

And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil

Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell

Thou hadst but power over his mortal body

His soul thou canst not have Therefore begone

Foul devil for God's sake hence and trouble us not

For thou hast made the happy Earth thy hell

Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims

If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds

Behold this pattern of thy butcheries

O gentlemen see see dead Henry's wounds

Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh

Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity

For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood

From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells

Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural

Provokes this deluge most unnatural

O God which this blood mad'st revenge his death

O Earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death

Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead

Or Earth gape open wide and eat him quick

As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood

Which his hell-governed arm hath butcherd

Villain thou know'st nor law of God nor man

No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity

O wonderful when devils tell the truth

Vouchsafe defused infection of a man

Of these known evils but to give me leave

By circumstance to curse thy cursd self

Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make

No excuse current but to hang thyself

And by despairing shalt thou stand excused

For doing worthy vengeance on thyself

That didst unworthy slaughter upon others

Then say they were not slain

But dead they are and devilish slave by thee

Why then he is alive

In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw

Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood

The which thou once didst bend against her breast

But that thy brothers beat aside the point

Thou wast provokd by thy bloody mind

That never dream'st on aught but butcheries

Didst thou not kill this king

Dost grant me hedgehog Then God grant me too

Thou mayst be damnd for that wicked deed

O he was gentle mild and virtuous

He is in heaven where thou shalt never come

And thou unfit for any place but hell

Some dungeon

Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest

I hope so

Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect

If I thought that I tell thee homicide

These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks

Black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life

I would I were to be revenged on thee

It is a quarrel just and reasonable

To be revenged on him that killed my husband

His better doth not breathe upon the earth

Name him

Why that was he

Where is he

Would it were mortal poison for thy sake

Never hung poison on a fouler toad

Out of my sight Thou dost infect mine eyes

Would they were basilisks' to strike thee dead

Arise dissembler Though I wish thy death

I will not be thy executioner

I have already

I would I knew thy heart

I fear me both are false

Well well put up your sword

That shalt thou know hereafter

All men I hope live so

To take is not to give

What is it

With all my heart and much it joys me too

To see you are become so penitent

Tressel and Berkeley go along with me

'Tis more than you deserve

But since you teach me how to flatter you

Imagine I have said farewell already

God give your Graces both

A happy and a joyful time of day

No farther than the Tower and as I guess

Upon the like devotion as yourselves

To gratulate the gentle princes there

Their aunt I am in law in love their mother

Then bring me to their sights I'll bear thy blame

And take thy office from thee on my peril

Despiteful tidings O unpleasing news

And I with all unwillingness will go

O would to God that the inclusive verge

Of golden metal that must round my brow

Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains

Anointed let me be with deadly venom

And die ere men can say God save the Queen

No Why When he that is my husband now

Came to me as I followed Henry's corse

When scarce the blood was well washed from his hands

Which issued from my other angel husband

And that dear saint which then I weeping followed

O when I say I looked on Richard's face

This was my wish be thou quoth I accursed

For making me so young so old a widow

And when thou wedd'st let sorrow haunt thy bed

And be thy wife if any be so mad

More miserable by the life of thee

Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death

Lo ere I can repeat this curse again

Within so small a time my woman's heart

Grossly grew captive to his honey words

And proved the subject of mine own soul's curse

Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest

For never yet one hour in his bed

Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep

But with his timorous dreams was still awaked

Besides he hates me for my father Warwick

And will no doubt shortly be rid of me

No more than with my soul I mourn for yours

Adieu poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it

Richard thy wife that wretched Anne thy wife

That never slept a quiet hour with thee

Now fills thy sleep with perturbations

Tomorrow in the battle think on me

And fall thy edgeless sword Despair and die

Thou quiet soul sleep thou a quiet sleep

Dream of success and happy victory

Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee
