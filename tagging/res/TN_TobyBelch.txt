


What a plague means my niece to take the death

of her brother thus I am sure care's an enemy to

life

Why let her except before excepted

Confine I'll confine myself no finer than I am

These clothes are good enough to drink in and so

be these boots too An they be not let them hang

themselves in their own straps

Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek

He's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria

Why he has three thousand ducats a year

Fie that you'll say so He plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys

and speaks three or four languages word

for word without book and hath all the good gifts of

nature

By this hand they are scoundrels and substractors

that say so of him Who are they

With drinking healths to my niece I'll drink to

her as long as there is a passage in my throat and

drink in Illyria He's a coward and a coistrel that

will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th'

toe like a parish top What wench Castiliano vulgo

for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface

Sweet Sir Andrew

Accost Sir Andrew accost

My niece's chambermaid

You mistake knight Accost is front her board

mightst never draw sword again

O knight thou lack'st a cup of canary When did

I see thee so put down

No question

Pourquoi my dear knight

Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair

Past question for thou seest it will not curl by

nature

Excellent It hangs like flax on a distaff and I

hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs

and spin it off

She'll none o' th' Count She'll not match above

her degree neither in estate years nor wit I have

heard her swear 't Tut there's life in 't man

Art thou good at these kickshawses knight

What is thy excellence in a galliard knight

And I can cut the mutton to 't

Wherefore are these things hid Wherefore have

these gifts a curtain before 'em Are they like to

take dust like Mistress Mall's picture Why dost

thou not go to church in a galliard and come home

in a coranto My very walk should be a jig I would

not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace

What dost thou mean Is it a world to hide virtues

in I did think by the excellent constitution of thy

leg it was formed under the star of a galliard

What shall we do else Were we not born under

Taurus

No sir it is legs and thighs Let me see thee

caper Ha higher Ha ha

me faith say I Well it's all one

Approach Sir Andrew Not to be abed after

midnight is to be up betimes and diluculo surgere

thou know'st

A false conclusion I hate it as an unfilled can To

be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early

so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed

betimes Does not our lives consist of the four

elements

Thou 'rt a scholar Let us therefore eat and

drink Marian I say a stoup of wine

Welcome ass Now let's have a catch

Come on there is

sixpence for you Let's have a song

A love song a love song

Good good

A contagious breath

To hear by the nose it is dulcet in contagion

But shall we make the welkin dance indeed Shall

we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw

three souls out of one weaver Shall we do that

My lady's a Cataian we are politicians Malvolio's

Do 't knight I'll write thee a challenge Or I'll

deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth

Possess us possess us tell us something of him

What for being a puritan Thy exquisite reason

dear knight

What wilt thou do

Excellent I smell a device

He shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop

that they come from my niece and that she's in

love with him

Good night Penthesilea

She's a beagle true bred and one that adores

me What o' that

Come come I'll go burn some sack 'Tis too

late to go to bed now Come knight come knight

Come thy ways Signior Fabian

Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly

rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame

To anger him we'll have the bear again and we

will fool him black and blue shall we not Sir

Andrew

Here comes the little villainHow now my

metal of India

Here's an overweening rogue

Peace I say

Ah rogue

Peace peace

O for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye

Fire and brimstone

Bolts and shackles

Shall this fellow live

And does not Toby take you a blow o' the

lips then

What what

Out scab

O peace and the spirit of humors intimate

reading aloud to him

Marry hang thee brock

Excellent wench say I

And with what wing the staniel checks

at it

O ay make up thatHe is now at a cold

scent

Ay or I'll cudgel him and make him cry

O

I could marry this wench for this device

And ask no other dowry with her but such

another jest

Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck

Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become

thy bondslave

Why thou hast put him in such a dream that

when the image of it leaves him he must run mad

Like aqua vitae with a midwife

To the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil

of wit

Save you gentleman

Will you encounter the house My niece is

desirous you should enter if your trade be to her

Taste your legs sir put them to motion

I mean to go sir to enter

Thy reason dear venom give thy reason

Did she see thee the while old boy Tell me

that

And they have been grand-jurymen since before

Noah was a sailor

Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis

of valor Challenge me the Count's youth to fight

with him Hurt him in eleven places My niece shall

take note of it and assure thyself there is no

love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's

commendation with woman than report of valor

Go write it in a martial hand Be curst and

brief It is no matter how witty so it be eloquent

and full of invention Taunt him with the license of

ink If thou -est him some thrice it shall not

be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of

paper although the sheet were big enough for the

bed of Ware in England set 'em down Go about it

Let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou

write with a goose-pen no matter About it

We'll call thee at the cubiculo Go

I have been dear to him lad some two thousand

strong or so

Never trust me then And by all means stir on

the youth to an answer I think oxen and wainropes

cannot hale them together For Andrew if he were

opened and you find so much blood in his liver as

will clog the foot of a flea I'll eat the rest of th'

anatomy

Look where the youngest wren of mine comes

And cross-gartered

Come bring us bring us where he is

Which way is he in the name of sanctity If all

the devils of hell be drawn in little and Legion

himself possessed him yet I'll speak to him

Go to go to Peace peace

We must deal gently with him Let me aloneHow

do you Malvolio How is 't with you What man

defy the devil Consider he's an enemy to mankind

Prithee hold thy peace This is not the way Do

you not see you move him Let me alone with

him

Why how now my bawcock How

dost thou chuck

Ay biddy come with meWhat man 'tis not

for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan Hang

him foul collier

Is 't possible

His very genius hath taken the infection of the

device man

Come we'll have him in a dark room and

bound My niece is already in the belief that he's

mad We may carry it thus for our pleasure and his

penance till our very pastime tired out of breath

prompt us to have mercy on him at which time we

will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a

finder of madmen But see but see

Give me Youth whatsoever thou art

thou art but a scurvy fellow

Wonder not nor admire not in thy mind

why I do call thee so for I will show thee no reason

for 't

Thou com'st to the Lady Olivia and in my

sight she uses thee kindly But thou liest in thy throat

that is not the matter I challenge thee for

I will waylay thee going home where if it be

thy chance to kill me

Thou kill'st me like a rogue and a villain

Fare thee well and God have mercy upon

one of our souls He may have mercy upon mine but

my hope is better and so look to thyself Thy friend as

thou usest him and thy sworn enemy

Andrew Aguecheek

If this letter move him not his legs cannot I'll

give 't him

Go Sir Andrew Scout me for him at the corner

of the orchard like a bum-baily So soon as ever

thou seest him draw and as thou draw'st swear

horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath

with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives

manhood more approbation than ever proof itself

would have earned him Away

Now will not I deliver his letter for the behavior

of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good

capacity and breeding his employment between

his lord and my niece confirms no less Therefore

this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed

no terror in the youth He will find it comes from a

clodpoll But sir I will deliver his challenge by

word of mouth set upon Aguecheek a notable

report of valor and drive the gentleman as I know

his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous

opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity This

will so fright them both that they will kill one

another by the look like cockatrices

I will meditate the while upon some horrid

message for a challenge

Gentleman God save thee

That defense thou hast betake thee to 't Of what

nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know

not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as

the hunter attends thee at the orchard end Dismount

thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy

assailant is quick skillful and deadly

You'll find it otherwise I assure you Therefore

if you hold your life at any price betake you to your

guard for your opposite hath in him what youth

strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal

He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and

on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private

brawl Souls and bodies hath he divorced three and

his incensement at this moment is so implacable

that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death

and sepulcher Hob nob is his word give 't or

take 't

Sir no His indignation derives itself out of a very

competent injury Therefore get you on and give

him his desire Back you shall not to the house

unless you undertake that with me which with as

much safety you might answer him Therefore on

or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you

must that's certain or forswear to wear iron about

you

I will do soSignior Fabian stay you by this

gentleman till my return

Why man he's a very devil I have not seen such

a firago I had a pass with him rapier scabbard

and all and he gives me the stuck-in with such

a mortal motion that it is inevitable and on the

answer he pays you as surely as your feet hits the

ground they step on They say he has been fencer

to the Sophy

Ay but he will not now be pacified Fabian can

scarce hold him yonder

I'll make the motion Stand here make a good

show on 't This shall end without the perdition of

souls Marry I'll ride your horse as well as I

ride you

I have his horse to take up the

quarrel I have persuaded him the youth's a devil

There's no remedy sir he will fight

with you for 's oath sake Marry he hath better

bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now

scarce to be worth talking of Therefore draw for

the supportance of his vow He protests he will not

hurt you

Come Sir Andrew there's no remedy The

gentleman will for his honor's sake have one bout

with you He cannot by the duello avoid it But he

has promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier

he will not hurt you Come on to 't

You sir Why what are you

Nay if you be an undertaker I am for you

I'll be with you anon

Come hither knight come hither Fabian We'll

whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws

A very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward

than a hare His dishonesty appears in leaving his

friend here in necessity and denying him and for

his cowardship ask Fabian

Do cuff him soundly but never draw thy

sword

I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet

Hold sir or I'll throw your dagger o'er the

house

Come on sir hold

Come sir I will not let you go Come my young

soldier put up your iron You are well fleshed

Come on

What what Nay then I must have an ounce or

two of this malapert blood from you

Madam

Jove bless thee Master Parson

To him Sir Topas

The knave counterfeits well A good knave

Well said Master Parson

My most exquisite Sir Topas

To him in thine own voice and bring me word

how thou find'st him I would we were well rid

of this knavery If he may be conveniently delivered

I would he were for I am now so far in

offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with

any safety this sport the upshot Come by and by

to my chamber

That's all one Has hurt me and there's th' end

on 't Sot didst see Dick Surgeon sot

Then he's a rogue and a passy-measures pavin I

hate a drunken rogue

Will you helpan ass-head and a coxcomb

and a knave a thin-faced knave a gull
