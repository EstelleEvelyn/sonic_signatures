


Never was monarch better feared and loved

Than is your Majesty There's not I think a subject

That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness

Under the sweet shade of your government

So may your Highness and yet punish too

I one my lord

Your Highness bade me ask for it today

I do confess my fault

And do submit me to your Highness' mercy

For me the gold of France did not seduce

Although I did admit it as a motive

The sooner to effect what I intended

But God be thankd for prevention

Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice

Beseeching God and you to pardon me
