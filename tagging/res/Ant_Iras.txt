There's a palm

presages chastity if nothing else

Go you wild bedfellow you cannot soothsay

But how but how Give me particulars

Am I not an inch of fortune better than she

Not in my husband's nose

Amen dear goddess hear that prayer of the

people For as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome

man loose-wived so it is a deadly sorrow to

behold a foul knave uncuckolded Therefore dear

Isis keep decorum and fortune him accordingly

The music ho

Do most dear queen

Madam O good empress

Go to him madam speak to him

He's unqualitied with very shame

A heavy sight

She's dead too our sovereign

Madam

Royal Egypt Empress

Royal queen

Finish good lady The bright day is done

And we are for the dark

The gods forbid

O the good gods

I'll never see 't For I am sure mine nails

Are stronger than mine eyes
