


A little more than kin and less than kind

Not so my lord I am too much in the sun

Ay madam it is common

Seems madam Nay it is I know not seems

'Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother

Nor customary suits of solemn black

Nor windy suspiration of forced breath

No nor the fruitful river in the eye

Nor the dejected havior of the visage

Together with all forms moods shapes of grief

That can denote me truly These indeed seem

For they are actions that a man might play

But I have that within which passes show

These but the trappings and the suits of woe

I shall in all my best obey you madam

O that this too too sullied flesh would melt

Thaw and resolve itself into a dew

Or that the Everlasting had not fixed

His canon 'gainst self-slaughter O God God

How weary stale flat and unprofitable

Seem to me all the uses of this world

Fie on 't ah fie 'Tis an unweeded garden

That grows to seed Things rank and gross in nature

Possess it merely That it should come to this

But two months deadnay not so much not two

So excellent a king that was to this

Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother

That he might not beteem the winds of heaven

Visit her face too roughly Heaven and Earth

Must I remember Why she would hang on him

As if increase of appetite had grown

By what it fed on And yet within a month

Let me not think on 't frailty thy name is woman

A little month or ere those shoes were old

With which she followed my poor father's body

Like Niobe all tearswhy she even she

O God a beast that wants discourse of reason

Would have mourned longer married with my uncle

My father's brother but no more like my father

Than I to Hercules Within a month

Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

Had left the flushing in her galld eyes

She married O most wicked speed to post

With such dexterity to incestuous sheets

It is not nor it cannot come to good

But break my heart for I must hold my tongue

I am glad to see you well

Horatioor I do forget myself

Sir my good friend I'll change that name with you

And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio

Marcellus

I am very glad to see you Good even sir

But what in faith make you from Wittenberg

I would not hear your enemy say so

Nor shall you do my ear that violence

To make it truster of your own report

Against yourself I know you are no truant

But what is your affair in Elsinore

We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart

I prithee do not mock me fellow student

I think it was to see my mother's wedding

Thrift thrift Horatio The funeral baked meats

Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables

Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

Or ever I had seen that day Horatio

My fathermethinks I see my father

In my mind's eye Horatio

He was a man Take him for all in all

I shall not look upon his like again

Saw who

The King my father

For God's love let me hear

But where was this

Did you not speak to it

'Tis very strange

Indeed sirs but this troubles me

Hold you the watch tonight

Armed say you

From top to toe

Then saw you not his face

What looked he frowningly

Pale or red

And fixed his eyes upon you

I would I had been there

Very like Stayed it long

His beard was grizzled no

I will watch tonight

Perchance 'twill walk again

If it assume my noble father's person

I'll speak to it though hell itself should gape

And bid me hold my peace I pray you all

If you have hitherto concealed this sight

Let it be tenable in your silence still

And whatsomever else shall hap tonight

Give it an understanding but no tongue

I will requite your loves So fare you well

Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve

I'll visit you

Your loves as mine to you Farewell

My father's spiritin arms All is not well

I doubt some foul play Would the night were come

Till then sit still my soul Foul deeds will rise

Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes

The air bites shrewdly it is very cold

What hour now

The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse

Keeps wassail and the swagg'ring upspring reels

And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down

The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out

The triumph of his pledge

Ay marry is 't

But to my mind though I am native here

And to the manner born it is a custom

More honored in the breach than the observance

This heavy-headed revel east and west

Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations

They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase

Soil our addition And indeed it takes

From our achievements though performed at height

The pith and marrow of our attribute

So oft it chances in particular men

That for some vicious mole of nature in them

As in their birth wherein they are not guilty

Since nature cannot choose his origin

By the o'ergrowth of some complexion

Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason

Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens

The form of plausive mannersthat these men

Carrying I say the stamp of one defect

Being nature's livery or fortune's star

His virtues else be they as pure as grace

As infinite as man may undergo

Shall in the general censure take corruption

From that particular fault The dram of evil

Doth all the noble substance of a doubt

To his own scandal

Angels and ministers of grace defend us

Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned

Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell

Be thy intents wicked or charitable

Thou com'st in such a questionable shape

That I will speak to thee I'll call thee Hamlet

King Father Royal Dane O answer me

Let me not burst in ignorance but tell

Why thy canonized bones hearsd in death

Have burst their cerements why the sepulcher

Wherein we saw thee quietly interred

Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws

To cast thee up again What may this mean

That thou dead corse again in complete steel

Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon

Making night hideous and we fools of nature

So horridly to shake our disposition

With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls

Say why is this Wherefore What should we do

It will not speak Then I will follow it

Why what should be the fear

I do not set my life at a pin's fee

And for my soul what can it do to that

Being a thing immortal as itself

It waves me forth again I'll follow it

It waves me stillGo on I'll follow thee

Hold off your hands

My fate cries out

And makes each petty arture in this body

As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve

Still am I called Unhand me gentlemen

By heaven I'll make a ghost of him that lets me

I say awayGo on I'll follow thee

Whither wilt thou lead me Speak I'll go no further

I will

Alas poor ghost

Speak I am bound to hear

What

O God

Murder

Haste me to know 't that I with wings as swift

As meditation or the thoughts of love

May sweep to my revenge

O my prophetic soul My uncle

O all you host of heaven O Earth What else

And shall I couple hell O fie Hold hold my heart

And you my sinews grow not instant old

But bear me stiffly up Remember thee

Ay thou poor ghost whiles memory holds a seat

In this distracted globe Remember thee

Yea from the table of my memory

I'll wipe away all trivial fond records

All saws of books all forms all pressures past

That youth and observation copied there

And thy commandment all alone shall live

Within the book and volume of my brain

Unmixed with baser matter Yes by heaven

O most pernicious woman

O villain villain smiling damnd villain

My tablesmeet it is I set it down

That one may smile and smile and be a villain

At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark

So uncle there you are Now to my word

It is adieu adieu remember me

I have sworn 't

So be it

Hillo ho ho boy Come bird come

O wonderful

No you will reveal it

How say you then Would heart of man once think it

But you'll be secret

There's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark

But he's an arrant knave

Why right you are in the right

And so without more circumstance at all

I hold it fit that we shake hands and part

You as your business and desire shall point you

For every man hath business and desire

Such as it is and for my own poor part

I will go pray

I am sorry they offend you heartily

Yes faith heartily

Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio

And much offense too Touching this vision here

It is an honest ghostthat let me tell you

For your desire to know what is between us

O'ermaster 't as you may And now good friends

As you are friends scholars and soldiers

Give me one poor request

Never make known what you have seen tonight

Nay but swear 't

Upon my sword

Indeed upon my sword indeed

Ha ha boy sayst thou so Art thou there truepenny

Come on you hear this fellow in the cellarage

Consent to swear

Never to speak of this that you have seen

Swear by my sword

Hic et ubique Then we'll shift our ground

Come hither gentlemen

And lay your hands again upon my sword

Swear by my sword

Never to speak of this that you have heard

Well said old mole Canst work i' th' earth so fast

A worthy pioner Once more remove good friends

And therefore as a stranger give it welcome

There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio

Than are dreamt of in your philosophy But come

Here as before never so help you mercy

How strange or odd some'er I bear myself

As I perchance hereafter shall think meet

To put an antic disposition on

That you at such times seeing me never shall

With arms encumbered thus or this headshake

Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase

As Well well we know or We could an if we would

Or If we list to speak or There be an if they might

Or such ambiguous giving-out to note

That you know aught of methis do swear

So grace and mercy at your most need help you

Rest rest perturbd spiritSo gentlemen

With all my love I do commend me to you

And what so poor a man as Hamlet is

May do t' express his love and friending to you

God willing shall not lack Let us go in together

And still your fingers on your lips I pray

The time is out of joint O cursd spite

That ever I was born to set it right

Nay come let's go together

Well God-a-mercy

Excellent well You are a fishmonger

Then I would you were so honest a man

Ay sir To be honest as this world goes is to

be one man picked out of ten thousand

For if the sun breed maggots in a dead

dog being a good kissing carrionHave you a

daughter

Let her not walk i' th' sun Conception is a

blessing but as your daughter may conceive

friend look to 't

Words words words

Between who

Slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here

that old men have gray beards that their faces are

wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and

plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of

wit together with most weak hams all which sir

though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I

hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for

yourself sir shall grow old as I am if like a crab

you could go backward

Into my grave

You cannot sir take from me anything that I

will more willingly part withalexcept my life

except my life except my life

These tedious old fools

My excellent good friends How dost thou

Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do

you both

Nor the soles of her shoe

Then you live about her waist or in the

middle of her favors

In the secret parts of Fortune O most true

She is a strumpet What news

Then is doomsday near But your news is not

true Let me question more in particular What

have you my good friends deserved at the hands of

Fortune that she sends you to prison hither

Denmark's a prison

A goodly one in which there are many confines

wards and dungeons Denmark being one o'

th' worst

Why then 'tis none to you for there is

nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it

so To me it is a prison

O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and

count myself a king of infinite space were it not

that I have bad dreams

A dream itself is but a shadow

Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs

and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows

Shall we to th' court For by my fay I cannot

reason

No such matter I will not sort you with the

rest of my servants for to speak to you like an

honest man I am most dreadfully attended But

in the beaten way of friendship what make you at

Elsinore

Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks

but I thank you and sure dear friends my thanks

are too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for

Is it your own inclining Is it a free visitation

Come come deal justly with me Come come nay

speak

Anything but to th' purpose You were sent

for and there is a kind of confession in your looks

which your modesties have not craft enough to

color I know the good king and queen have sent for

you

That you must teach me But let me conjure

you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy

of our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved

love and by what more dear a better

proposer can charge you withal be even and direct

with me whether you were sent for or no

Nay then I have an eye of youIf

you love me hold not off

I will tell you why so shall my anticipation

prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the

King and Queen molt no feather I have of late but

wherefore I know not lost all my mirth forgone all

custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily

with my disposition that this goodly frame the

Earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most

excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging

firmament this majestical roof fretted

with golden firewhy it appeareth nothing to me

but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors

What a piece of work is a man how noble in

reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving

how express and admirable in action how like

an angel in apprehension how like a god the

beauty of the world the paragon of animalsand

yet to me what is this quintessence of dust Man

delights not me no nor women neither though by

your smiling you seem to say so

Why did you laugh then when I said man

delights not me

He that plays the king shall be welcomehis

Majesty shall have tribute on me The adventurous

knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall

not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his

part in peace the clown shall make those laugh

whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear and the lady

shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall

halt for 't What players are they

How chances it they travel Their residence

both in reputation and profit was better both ways

Do they hold the same estimation they did

when I was in the city Are they so followed

How comes it Do they grow rusty

What are they children Who maintains 'em

How are they escoted Will they pursue the quality

no longer than they can sing Will they not say

afterwards if they should grow themselves to common

players as it is most like if their means are

no better their writers do them wrong to make

them exclaim against their own succession

Is 't possible

Do the boys carry it away

It is not very strange for my uncle is King of

Denmark and those that would make mouths at

him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty

a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little

'Sblood there is something in this more than natural

if philosophy could find it out

Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore

Your hands come then Th' appurtenance of welcome

is fashion and ceremony Let me comply

with you in this garb lest my extent to the players

which I tell you must show fairly outwards should

more appear like entertainment than yours You are

welcome But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are

deceived

I am but mad north-north-west When the

wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw

Hark you Guildenstern and you tooat

each ear a hearer That great baby you see there is

not yet out of his swaddling clouts

I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the

players mark itYou say right sir a Monday

morning 'twas then indeed

My lord I have news to tell you when Roscius

was an actor in Rome

Buzz buzz

Then came each actor on his ass

O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure

hadst thou

Why

One fair daughter and no more

The which he lovd passing well

Am I not i' th' right old Jephthah

Nay that follows not

Why

As by lot God wot

and then you know

It came to pass as most like it was

the first row of the pious chanson will show you

more for look where my abridgment comes

You are welcome masters welcome allI am glad

to see thee wellWelcome good friendsO my

old friend Why thy face is valanced since I saw thee

last Com'st thou to beard me in DenmarkWhat

my young lady and mistress By 'r Lady your Ladyship

is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by

the altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like a

piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the

ring Masters you are all welcome We'll e'en to 't

like French falconers fly at anything we see We'll

have a speech straight Come give us a taste of your

quality Come a passionate speech

I heard thee speak me a speech once but it

was never acted or if it was not above once for

the play I remember pleased not the million

'twas caviary to the general But it was as I

received it and others whose judgments in such

matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play

well digested in the scenes set down with as much

modesty as cunning I remember one said there

were no sallets in the lines to make the matter

savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict

the author of affection but called it an honest

method as wholesome as sweet and by very much

more handsome than fine One speech in 't I

chiefly loved 'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido and

thereabout of it especially when he speaks of

Priam's slaughter If it live in your memory begin at

this linelet me see let me see

The rugged Pyrrhus like th' Hyrcanian beast

'tis not so it begins with Pyrrhus

The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms

Black as his purpose did the night resemble

When he lay couchd in th' ominous horse

Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared

With heraldry more dismal Head to foot

Now is he total gules horridly tricked

With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons

Baked and impasted with the parching streets

That lend a tyrannous and a damnd light

To their lord's murder Roasted in wrath and fire

And thus o'ersizd with coagulate gore

With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus

Old grandsire Priam seeks

So proceed you

It shall to the barber's with your beard

Prithee say on He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or

he sleeps Say on come to Hecuba

The mobld queen

'Tis well I'll have thee speak out the rest of

this soonGood my lord will you see the players

well bestowed Do you hear let them be well used

for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the

time After your death you were better have a bad

epitaph than their ill report while you live

God's bodykins man much better Use every

man after his desert and who shall 'scape

whipping Use them after your own honor and

dignity The less they deserve the more merit is in

your bounty Take them in

Follow him friends We'll hear a play

tomorrow

Dost thou hear me old friend Can

you play The Murder of Gonzago

We'll ha 't tomorrow night You could for a

need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen

lines which I would set down and insert in 't

could you not

Very well Follow that lordand look you

mock him not My good friends

I'll leave you till night You are welcome to Elsinore

Ay so good-bye to you  Now I am alone

O what a rogue and peasant slave am I

Is it not monstrous that this player here

But in a fiction in a dream of passion

Could force his soul so to his own conceit

That from her working all his visage wanned

Tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect

A broken voice and his whole function suiting

With forms to his conceitand all for nothing

For Hecuba

What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba

That he should weep for her What would he do

Had he the motive and the cue for passion

That I have He would drown the stage with tears

And cleave the general ear with horrid speech

Make mad the guilty and appall the free

Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed

The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I

A dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak

Like John-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause

And can say nothingno not for a king

Upon whose property and most dear life

A damned defeat was made Am I a coward

Who calls me villain breaks my pate across

Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face

Tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i' th' throat

As deep as to the lungs Who does me this

Ha 'Swounds I should take it For it cannot be

But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall

To make oppression bitter or ere this

I should have fatted all the region kites

With this slave's offal Bloody bawdy villain

Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain

O vengeance

Why what an ass am I This is most brave

That I the son of a dear father murdered

Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell

Must like a whore unpack my heart with words

And fall a-cursing like a very drab

A stallion Fie upon 't Foh

About my brainsHum I have heard

That guilty creatures sitting at a play

Have by the very cunning of the scene

Been struck so to the soul that presently

They have proclaimed their malefactions

For murder though it have no tongue will speak

With most miraculous organ I'll have these players

Play something like the murder of my father

Before mine uncle I'll observe his looks

I'll tent him to the quick If he do blench

I know my course The spirit that I have seen

May be a devil and the devil hath power

T' assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps

Out of my weakness and my melancholy

As he is very potent with such spirits

Abuses me to damn me I'll have grounds

More relative than this The play's the thing

Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King

To be or not to bethat is the question

Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles

And by opposing end them To die to sleep

No moreand by a sleep to say we end

The heartache and the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to'tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wished To die to sleep

To sleep perchance to dream Ay there's the rub

For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

When we have shuffled off this mortal coil

Must give us pause There's the respect

That makes calamity of so long life

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time

Th' oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely

The pangs of despised love the law's delay

The insolence of office and the spurns

That patient merit of th' unworthy takes

When he himself might his quietus make

With a bare bodkin Who would fardels bear

To grunt and sweat under a weary life

But that the dread of something after death

The undiscovered country from whose bourn

No traveler returns puzzles the will

And makes us rather bear those ills we have

Than fly to others that we know not of

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all

And thus the native hue of resolution

Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought

And enterprises of great pitch and moment

With this regard their currents turn awry

And lose the name of actionSoft you now

The fair OpheliaNymph in thy orisons

Be all my sins remembered

I humbly thank you well

No not I I never gave you aught

Ha ha are you honest

Are you fair

That if you be honest and fair your honesty

should admit no discourse to your beauty

Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner

transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than

the force of honesty can translate beauty into his

likeness This was sometime a paradox but now

the time gives it proof I did love you once

You should not have believed me for virtue

cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall

relish of it I loved you not

Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be

a breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest

but yet I could accuse me of such things that it

were better my mother had not borne me I am

very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses

at my beck than I have thoughts to put them

in imagination to give them shape or time to act

them in What should such fellows as I do crawling

between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves

all believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery

Where's your father

Let the doors be shut upon him that he may

play the fool nowhere but in 's own house Farewell

If thou dost marry I'll give thee this plague

for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as

snow thou shalt not escape calumny Get thee to a

nunnery farewell Or if thou wilt needs marry

marry a fool for wise men know well enough what

monsters you make of them To a nunnery go and

quickly too Farewell

I have heard of your paintings too well

enough God hath given you one face and you

make yourselves another You jig and amble and

you lisp you nickname God's creatures and make

your wantonness your ignorance Go to I'll no

more on 't It hath made me mad I say we will have

no more marriage Those that are married already

all but one shall live The rest shall keep as they are

To a nunnery go

Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced

it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth

it as many of our players do I had as lief the

town-crier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air

too much with your hand thus but use all gently

for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say

whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and

beget a temperance that may give it smoothness O

it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious

periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very

rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the

most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable

dumb shows and noise I would have such a fellow

whipped for o'erdoing Termagant It out-Herods

Herod Pray you avoid it

Be not too tame neither but let your own

discretion be your tutor Suit the action to the

word the word to the action with this special

observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of

nature For anything so o'erdone is from the purpose

of playing whose end both at the first and

now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to

nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her

own image and the very age and body of the time

his form and pressure Now this overdone or come

tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh

cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure

of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh

a whole theater of others O there be players that I

have seen play and heard others praise and that

highly not to speak it profanely that neither

having th' accent of Christians nor the gait of

Christian pagan nor man have so strutted and

bellowed that I have thought some of nature's

journeymen had made men and not made them

well they imitated humanity so abominably

O reform it altogether And let those that play

your clowns speak no more than is set down for

them for there be of them that will themselves

laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators

to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary

question of the play be then to be considered

That's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition

in the fool that uses it Go make you ready

How now my lord will the King hear this piece of

work

Bid the players make haste

Will you two help to hasten them

What ho Horatio

Horatio thou art e'en as just a man

As e'er my conversation coped withal

Nay do not think I flatter

For what advancement may I hope from thee

That no revenue hast but thy good spirits

To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flattered

No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp

And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee

Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear

Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice

And could of men distinguish her election

Hath sealed thee for herself For thou hast been

As one in suffering all that suffers nothing

A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards

Hast ta'en with equal thanks and blessed are those

Whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled

That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger

To sound what stop she please Give me that man

That is not passion's slave and I will wear him

In my heart's core ay in my heart of heart

As I do theeSomething too much of this

There is a play tonight before the King

One scene of it comes near the circumstance

Which I have told thee of my father's death

I prithee when thou seest that act afoot

Even with the very comment of thy soul

Observe my uncle If his occulted guilt

Do not itself unkennel in one speech

It is a damnd ghost that we have seen

And my imaginations are as foul

As Vulcan's stithy Give him heedful note

For I mine eyes will rivet to his face

And after we will both our judgments join

In censure of his seeming

They are coming to the play I must be idle

Get you a place

Excellent i' faith of the chameleon's dish I

eat the air promise-crammed You cannot feed

capons so

No nor mine now My lord you

played once i' th' university you say

What did you enact

It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a

calf thereBe the players ready

No good mother Here's metal more

attractive

Lady shall I lie in your lap

I mean my head upon your lap

Do you think I meant country matters

That's a fair thought to lie between maids'

legs

Nothing

Who I

O God your only jig-maker What should a

man do but be merry For look you how cheerfully

my mother looks and my father died within 's two

hours

So long Nay then let the devil wear black

for I'll have a suit of sables O heavens die two

months ago and not forgotten yet Then there's

hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half

a year But by 'r Lady he must build churches then

or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the

hobby-horse whose epitaph is For oh for oh the

hobby-horse is forgot

Marry this is miching mallecho It means

mischief

We shall know by this fellow The players

cannot keep counsel they'll tell all

Ay or any show that you will show him Be

not you ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you

what it means

Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring

As woman's love

That's wormwood

If she should break it now

Madam how like you this play

O but she'll keep her word

No no they do but jest poison in jest No

offense i' th' world

The Mousetrap Marry how Tropically

This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna

Gonzago is the duke's name his wife Baptista You

shall see anon 'Tis a knavish piece of work but

what of that Your Majesty and we that have free

souls it touches us not Let the galled jade wince

our withers are unwrung

This is one Lucianus nephew to the king

I could interpret between you and your love

if I could see the puppets dallying

It would cost you a groaning to take off mine

edge

So you mis-take your husbandsBegin

murderer Pox leave thy damnable faces and

begin Come the croaking raven doth bellow for

revenge

He poisons him i' th' garden for his estate His

name's Gonzago The story is extant and written in

very choice Italian You shall see anon how the

murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife

What frighted with false fire

Why let the strucken deer go weep

The hart ungalld play

For some must watch while some must sleep

Thus runs the world away

Would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the

rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me with two

Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a

fellowship in a cry of players

A whole one I

For thou dost know O Damon dear

This realm dismantled was

Of Jove himself and now reigns here

A very verypajock

O good Horatio I'll take the ghost's word for

a thousand pound Didst perceive

Upon the talk of the poisoning

Ah ha Come some music Come the

recorders

For if the King like not the comedy

Why then belike he likes it not perdy

Come some music

Sir a whole history

Ay sir what of him

With drink sir

Your wisdom should show itself more richer

to signify this to the doctor for for me to put him to

his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more

choler

I am tame sir Pronounce

You are welcome

Sir I cannot

Make you a wholesome answer My wit's

diseased But sir such answer as I can make you

shall commandor rather as you say my mother

Therefore no more but to the matter My mother

you say

O wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother

But is there no sequel at the heels of this

mother's admiration Impart

We shall obey were she ten times our mother

Have you any further trade with us

And do still by these pickers and stealers

Sir I lack advancement

Ay sir but While the grass growsthe

proverb is something musty

O the recorders Let me see one

To withdraw

with you why do you go about to recover the wind

of me as if you would drive me into a toil

I do not well understand that Will you play

upon this pipe

I pray you

I do beseech you

It is as easy as lying Govern these ventages

with your fingers and thumb give it breath with

your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent

music Look you these are the stops

Why look you now how unworthy a thing

you make of me You would play upon me you

would seem to know my stops you would pluck

out the heart of my mystery you would sound me

from my lowest note to the top of my compass

and there is much music excellent voice in this

little organ yet cannot you make it speak 'Sblood

do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe

Call me what instrument you will though you can

fret me you cannot play upon me

God bless you sir

Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in

shape of a camel

Methinks it is like a weasel

Or like a whale

Then I will come to my mother by and by

They fool me to the top of my bentI will

come by and by

By and by is easily said Leave me

friends

'Tis now the very witching time of night

When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out

Contagion to this world Now could I drink hot blood

And do such bitter business as the day

Would quake to look on Soft now to my mother

O heart lose not thy nature let not ever

The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom

Let me be cruel not unnatural

I will speak daggers to her but use none

My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites

How in my words somever she be shent

To give them seals never my soul consent

Now might I do it pat now he is a-praying

And now I'll do 't And so he goes to heaven

And so am I revenged That would be scanned

A villain kills my father and for that

I his sole son do this same villain send

To heaven

Why this is hire and salary not revenge

He took my father grossly full of bread

With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May

And how his audit stands who knows save heaven

But in our circumstance and course of thought

'Tis heavy with him And am I then revenged

To take him in the purging of his soul

When he is fit and seasoned for his passage

No

Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent

When he is drunk asleep or in his rage

Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed

At game a-swearing or about some act

That has no relish of salvation in 't

Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven

And that his soul may be as damned and black

As hell whereto it goes My mother stays

This physic but prolongs thy sickly days

Mother mother mother

Now mother what's the matter

Mother you have my father much offended

Go go you question with a wicked tongue

What's the matter now

No by the rood not so

You are the Queen your husband's brother's wife

And would it were not so you are my mother

Come come and sit you down you shall not budge

You go not till I set you up a glass

Where you may see the inmost part of you

How now a rat Dead for a ducat dead

Nay I know not Is it the King

A bloody deedalmost as bad good mother

As kill a king and marry with his brother

Ay lady it was my word

Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell

I took thee for thy better Take thy fortune

Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger

Leave wringing of your hands Peace sit you down

And let me wring your heart for so I shall

If it be made of penetrable stuff

If damnd custom have not brazed it so

That it be proof and bulwark against sense

Such an act

That blurs the grace and blush of modesty

Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose

From the fair forehead of an innocent love

And sets a blister there makes marriage vows

As false as dicers' oathsO such a deed

As from the body of contraction plucks

The very soul and sweet religion makes

A rhapsody of words Heaven's face does glow

O'er this solidity and compound mass

With heated visage as against the doom

Is thought-sick at the act

Look here upon this picture and on this

The counterfeit presentment of two brothers

See what a grace was seated on this brow

Hyperion's curls the front of Jove himself

An eye like Mars' to threaten and command

A station like the herald Mercury

New-lighted on a -kissing hill

A combination and a form indeed

Where every god did seem to set his seal

To give the world assurance of a man

This was your husband Look you now what follows

Here is your husband like a mildewed ear

Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes

Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed

And batten on this moor Ha Have you eyes

You cannot call it love for at your age

The heyday in the blood is tame it's humble

And waits upon the judgment and what judgment

Would step from this to this Sense sure you have

Else could you not have motion but sure that sense

Is apoplexed for madness would not err

Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled

But it reserved some quantity of choice

To serve in such a difference What devil was 't

That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind

Eyes without feeling feeling without sight

Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all

Or but a sickly part of one true sense

Could not so mope O shame where is thy blush

Rebellious hell

If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones

To flaming youth let virtue be as wax

And melt in her own fire Proclaim no shame

When the compulsive ardor gives the charge

Since frost itself as actively doth burn

And reason panders will

Nay but to live

In the rank sweat of an enseamd bed

Stewed in corruption honeying and making love

Over the nasty sty

A murderer and a villain

A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe

Of your precedent lord a vice of kings

A cutpurse of the empire and the rule

That from a shelf the precious diadem stole

And put it in his pocket

A king of shreds and patches

Save me and hover o'er me with your wings

You heavenly guardsWhat would your gracious figure

Do you not come your tardy son to chide

That lapsed in time and passion lets go by

Th' important acting of your dread command

O say

How is it with you lady

On him on him Look you how pale he glares

His form and cause conjoined preaching to stones

Would make them capable Do not look upon me

Lest with this piteous action you convert

My stern effects Then what I have to do

Will want true colortears perchance for blood

Do you see nothing there

Nor did you nothing hear

Why look you there look how it steals away

My father in his habit as he lived

Look where he goes even now out at the portal

Ecstasy

My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time

And makes as healthful music It is not madness

That I have uttered Bring me to the test

And I the matter will reword which madness

Would gambol from Mother for love of grace

Lay not that flattering unction to your soul

That not your trespass but my madness speaks

It will but skin and film the ulcerous place

Whiles rank corruption mining all within

Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven

Repent what's past avoid what is to come

And do not spread the compost on the weeds

To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue

For in the fatness of these pursy times

Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg

Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good

O throw away the worser part of it

And live the purer with the other half

Good night But go not to my uncle's bed

Assume a virtue if you have it not

That monster custom who all sense doth eat

Of habits devil is angel yet in this

That to the use of actions fair and good

He likewise gives a frock or livery

That aptly is put on Refrain tonight

And that shall lend a kind of easiness

To the next abstinence the next more easy

For use almost can change the stamp of nature

And either  the devil or throw him out

With wondrous potency Once more good night

And when you are desirous to be blest

I'll blessing beg of you For this same lord

I do repent but heaven hath pleased it so

To punish me with this and this with me

That I must be their scourge and minister

I will bestow him and will answer well

The death I gave him So again good night

I must be cruel only to be kind

This bad begins and worse remains behind

One word more good lady

Not this by no means that I bid you do

Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed

Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse

And let him for a pair of reechy kisses

Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers

Make you to ravel all this matter out

That I essentially am not in madness

But mad in craft 'Twere good you let him know

For who that's but a queen fair sober wise

Would from a paddock from a bat a gib

Such dear concernings hide Who would do so

No in despite of sense and secrecy

Unpeg the basket on the house's top

Let the birds fly and like the famous ape

To try conclusions in the basket creep

And break your own neck down

I must to England you know that

There's letters sealed and my two schoolfellows

Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged

They bear the mandate they must sweep my way

And marshal me to knavery Let it work

For 'tis the sport to have the enginer

Hoist with his own petard and 't shall go hard

But I will delve one yard below their mines

And blow them at the moon O 'tis most sweet

When in one line two crafts directly meet

This man shall set me packing

I'll lug the guts into the neighbor room

Mother good night indeed This counselor

Is now most still most secret and most grave

Who was in life a foolish prating knave

Come sir to draw toward an end with you

Good night mother

Safely stowed

But soft what noise Who calls on Hamlet

O here they come

Compounded it with dust whereto 'tis kin

Do not believe it

That I can keep your counsel and not mine

own Besides to be demanded of a sponge what

replication should be made by the son of a king

Ay sir that soaks up the King's countenance

his rewards his authorities But such officers do the

King best service in the end He keeps them like an

ape an apple in the corner of his jaw first mouthed

to be last swallowed When he needs what you have

gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you

shall be dry again

I am glad of it A knavish speech sleeps in a

foolish ear

The body is with the King but the King is not

with the body The King is a thing

Of nothing Bring me to him Hide fox and

all after

At supper

Not where he eats but where he is eaten A

certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at

him Your worm is your only emperor for diet We

fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves

for maggots Your fat king and your lean beggar is

but variable servicetwo dishes but to one table

That's the end

A man may fish with the worm that hath eat

of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that

worm

Nothing but to show you how a king may go a

progress through the guts of a beggar

In heaven Send thither to see If your messenger

find him not there seek him i' th' other

place yourself But if indeed you find him not

within this month you shall nose him as you go up

the stairs into the lobby

He will stay till you come

For England

Good

I see a cherub that sees them But come for England

Farewell dear mother

My mother Father and mother is man and wife

Man and wife is one flesh and so my mother

Come for England

Good sir whose powers are these

How purposed sir I pray you

Who commands them sir

Goes it against the main of Poland sir

Or for some frontier

Why then the Polack never will defend it

Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats

Will not debate the question of this straw

This is th' impostume of much wealth and peace

That inward breaks and shows no cause without

Why the man diesI humbly thank you sir

I'll be with you straight Go a little before

How all occasions do inform against me

And spur my dull revenge What is a man

If his chief good and market of his time

Be but to sleep and feed A beast no more

Sure He that made us with such large discourse

Looking before and after gave us not

That capability and godlike reason

To fust in us unused Now whether it be

Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple

Of thinking too precisely on th' event

A thought which quartered hath but one part wisdom

And ever three parts coward I do not know

Why yet I live to say This thing's to do

Sith I have cause and will and strength and means

To do 't Examples gross as Earth exhort me

Witness this army of such mass and charge

Led by a delicate and tender prince

Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed

Makes mouths at the invisible event

Exposing what is mortal and unsure

To all that fortune death and danger dare

Even for an eggshell Rightly to be great

Is not to stir without great argument

But greatly to find quarrel in a straw

When honor's at the stake How stand I then

That have a father killed a mother stained

Excitements of my reason and my blood

And let all sleep while to my shame I see

The imminent death of twenty thousand men

That for a fantasy and trick of fame

Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot

Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause

Which is not tomb enough and continent

To hide the slain O from this time forth

My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth

Has this fellow no feeling of his business He

sings in grave-making

'Tis e'en so The hand of little employment

hath the daintier sense

That skull had a tongue in it and could sing

once How the knave jowls it to the ground as if

'twere Cain's jawbone that did the first murder

This might be the pate of a politician which this ass

now o'erreaches one that would circumvent God

might it not

Or of a courtier which could say Good

morrow sweet lord How dost thou sweet lord

This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my

Lord Such-a-one's horse when he went to beg it

might it not

Why e'en so And now my Lady Worm's

chapless and knocked about the mazard with a

sexton's spade Here's fine revolution an we had

the trick to see 't Did these bones cost no more the

breeding but to play at loggets with them Mine

ache to think on 't

There's another Why may not that be the

skull of a lawyer Where be his quiddities now his

quillities his cases his tenures and his tricks Why

does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him

about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell

him of his action of battery Hum this fellow might

be in 's time a great buyer of land with his statutes

his recognizances his fines his double vouchers

his recoveries Is this the fine of his fines and the

recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full

of fine dirt Will his vouchers vouch him no more

of his purchases and double ones too than the

length and breadth of a pair of indentures The very

conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box

and must th' inheritor himself have no more ha

Is not parchment made of sheepskins

They are sheep and calves which seek out

assurance in that I will speak to this fellow

Whose grave's this sirrah

I think it be thine indeed for thou liest in 't

Thou dost lie in 't to be in 't and say it is thine

'Tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou

liest

What man dost thou dig it for

What woman then

Who is to be buried in 't

How absolute the knave is We must speak by

the card or equivocation will undo us By the

Lord Horatio this three years I have took note of

it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the

peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he

galls his kibeHow long hast thou been

grave-maker

How long is that since

Ay marry why was he sent into England

Why

How came he mad

How strangely

Upon what ground

How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot

Why he more than another

Whose was it

Nay I know not

This

Let me see Alas poor

Yorick I knew him Horatioa fellow of infinite

jest of most excellent fancy He hath bore me on his

back a thousand times and now how abhorred in

my imagination it is My gorge rises at it Here hung

those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft

Where be your gibes now your gambols your

songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to

set the table on a roar Not one now to mock your

own grinning Quite chapfallen Now get you to my

lady's chamber and tell her let her paint an inch

thick to this favor she must come Make her laugh

at thatPrithee Horatio tell me one thing

Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this

fashion i' th' earth

And smelt so Pah

To what base uses we may return Horatio

Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of

Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole

No faith not a jot but to follow him thither

with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as

thus Alexander died Alexander was buried Alexander

returneth to dust the dust is earth of earth

we make loam and why of that loam whereto he

was converted might they not stop a beer barrel

Imperious Caesar dead and turned to clay

Might stop a hole to keep the wind away

O that that earth which kept the world in awe

Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw

But soft but soft awhile Here comes the King

The Queen the courtiers Who is this they follow

And with such maimd rites This doth betoken

The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand

Fordo its own life 'Twas of some estate

Couch we awhile and mark

That is Laertes a very noble youth Mark

What the fair Ophelia

 What is he whose grief

Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow

Conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand

Like wonder-wounded hearers This is I

Hamlet the Dane

Thou pray'st not well

I prithee take thy fingers from my throat

For though I am not splenitive and rash

Yet have I in me something dangerous

Which let thy wisdom fear Hold off thy hand

Why I will fight with him upon this theme

Until my eyelids will no longer wag

I loved Ophelia Forty thousand brothers

Could not with all their quantity of love

Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her

'Swounds show me what thou 't do

Woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself

Woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile

I'll do 't Dost thou come here to whine

To outface me with leaping in her grave

Be buried quick with her and so will I

And if thou prate of mountains let them throw

Millions of acres on us till our ground

Singeing his pate against the burning zone

Make Ossa like a wart Nay an thou 'lt mouth

I'll rant as well as thou

Hear you sir

What is the reason that you use me thus

I loved you ever But it is no matter

Let Hercules himself do what he may

The cat will mew and dog will have his day

So much for this sir Now shall you see the other

You do remember all the circumstance

Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting

That would not let me sleep Methought I lay

Worse than the mutines in the bilboes Rashly

And praised be rashness for it let us know

Our indiscretion sometime serves us well

When our deep plots do pall and that should learn us

There's a divinity that shapes our ends

Rough-hew them how we will

Up from my cabin

My sea-gown scarfed about me in the dark

Groped I to find out them had my desire

Fingered their packet and in fine withdrew

To mine own room again making so bold

My fears forgetting manners to unfold

Their grand commission where I found Horatio

A royal knaveryan exact command

Larded with many several sorts of reasons

Importing Denmark's health and England's too

Withhosuch bugs and goblins in my life

That on the supervise no leisure bated

No not to stay the grinding of the ax

My head should be struck off

Here's the commission Read it at more leisure

But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed

Being thus benetted round with villainies

Or I could make a prologue to my brains

They had begun the play I sat me down

Devised a new commission wrote it fair

I once did hold it as our statists do

A baseness to write fair and labored much

How to forget that learning but sir now

It did me yeoman's service Wilt thou know

Th' effect of what I wrote

An earnest conjuration from the King

As England was his faithful tributary

As love between them like the palm might flourish

As peace should still her wheaten garland wear

And stand a comma 'tween their amities

And many suchlike es of great charge

That on the view and knowing of these contents

Without debatement further more or less

He should those bearers put to sudden death

Not shriving time allowed

Why even in that was heaven ordinant

I had my father's signet in my purse

Which was the model of that Danish seal

Folded the writ up in the form of th' other

Subscribed it gave 't th' impression placed it safely

The changeling never known Now the next day

Was our sea-fight and what to this was sequent

Thou knowest already

Why man they did make love to this employment

They are not near my conscience Their defeat

Does by their own insinuation grow

'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes

Between the pass and fell incensd points

Of mighty opposites

Does it not think thee stand me now upon

He that hath killed my king and whored my mother

Popped in between th' election and my hopes

Thrown out his angle for my proper life

And with such cozenageis 't not perfect conscience

To quit him with this arm And is 't not to be damned

To let this canker of our nature come

In further evil

It will be short The interim's mine

And a man's life's no more than to say one

But I am very sorry good Horatio

That to Laertes I forgot myself

For by the image of my cause I see

The portraiture of his I'll court his favors

But sure the bravery of his grief did put me

Into a tow'ring passion

I humbly thank you sir

Dost know this waterfly

Thy state is the more gracious

for 'tis a vice to know him He hath much

land and fertile Let a beast be lord of beasts and his

crib shall stand at the king's mess 'Tis a chough

but as I say spacious in the possession of dirt

I will receive it sir with all diligence of

spirit Put your bonnet to his right use 'tis for the

head

No believe me 'tis very cold the wind is

northerly

But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for

my complexion

I beseech you remember

Sir his definement suffers no perdition in

you though I know to divide him inventorially

would dozy th' arithmetic of memory and yet but

yaw neither in respect of his quick sail But in the

verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great

article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness

as to make true diction of him his semblable is his

mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage

nothing more

The concernancy sir Why do we wrap the

gentleman in our more rawer breath

What imports the nomination of

this gentleman

Of him sir

I would you did sir Yet in faith if you did it

would not much approve me Well sir

I dare not confess that lest I should compare

with him in excellence But to know a man well

were to know himself

What's his weapon

That's two of his weapons But well

What call you the carriages

The phrase would be more germane to the

matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides I

would it might be hangers till then But on Six

Barbary horses against six French swords their

assigns and three liberal-conceited carriages

that's the French bet against the Danish Why is this

all impawned as you call it

How if I answer no

Sir I will walk here in the hall If it please his

Majesty it is the breathing time of day with me Let

the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the

King hold his purpose I will win for him an I can

If not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd

hits

To this effect sir after what flourish your

nature will

Yours He does well to commend

it himself There are no tongues else for 's

turn

He did comply sir with his dug before he

sucked it Thus has he and many more of the same

breed that I know the drossy age dotes on only got

the tune of the time and out of an habit of

encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries

them through and through the most fanned

and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to

their trial the bubbles are out

I am constant to my purposes They follow

the King's pleasure If his fitness speaks mine is

ready now or whensoever provided I be so able as

now

In happy time

She well instructs me

I do not think so Since he went into France I

have been in continual practice I shall win at the

odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here

about my heart But it is no matter

It is but foolery but it is such a kind of

gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman

Not a whit We defy augury There is a

special providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be

now 'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be

now if it be not now yet it will come The

readiness is all Since no man of aught he leaves

knows what is 't to leave betimes Let be

Give me your pardon sir I have done you wrong

But pardon 't as you are a gentleman This presence knows

And you must needs have heard how I am punished

With a sore distraction What I have done

That might your nature honor and exception

Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness

Was 't Hamlet wronged Laertes Never Hamlet

If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away

And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes

Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it

Who does it then His madness If 't be so

Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged

His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy

Sir in this audience

Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil

Free me so far in your most generous thoughts

That I have shot my arrow o'er the house

And hurt my brother

I embrace it freely

And will this brothers' wager frankly play

Give us the foils Come on

I'll be your foil Laertes in mine ignorance

Your skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night

Stick fiery off indeed

No by this hand

Very well my lord

Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side

This likes me well These foils have all a length

Come on sir

One

Judgment

I'll play this bout first Set it by awhile

Come Another hit What say you

Good madam

I dare not drink yet madamby and by

Come for the third Laertes You do but dally

I pray you pass with your best violence

I am afeard you make a wanton of me

Nay come again

How does the Queen

O villainy Ho Let the door be locked

Treachery Seek it out

The point envenomed too Then venom to thy work

Here thou incestuous murd'rous damnd Dane

Drink off this potion Is thy union here

Follow my mother

Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee

I am dead HoratioWretched queen adieu

You that look pale and tremble at this chance

That are but mutes or audience to this act

Had I but time as this fell sergeant Death

Is strict in his arrest O I could tell you

But let it beHoratio I am dead

Thou livest report me and my cause aright

To the unsatisfied

As thou 'rt a man

Give me the cup Let go By heaven I'll ha 't

O God Horatio what a wounded name

Things standing thus unknown shall I leave behind me

If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart

Absent thee from felicity awhile

And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain

To tell my story  What warlike noise is this

O I die Horatio

The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit

I cannot live to hear the news from England

But I do prophesy th' election lights

On Fortinbras he has my dying voice

So tell him with th' occurrents more and less

Which have solicitedthe rest is silence

O O O O
