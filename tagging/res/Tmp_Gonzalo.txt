


Nay, good, be patient.

Good, yet remember whom thou hast

aboard.

I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks

he hath no drowning mark upon him. His

complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good

Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny

our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be

not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

I’ll warrant him for drowning, though the

ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky

as an unstanched wench.

The King and Prince at prayers. Let’s assist

them, for our case is as theirs.

He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of

water swear against it and gape at wid’st to glut him.

Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea

for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown

furze, anything. The wills above be done, but I

would fain die a dry death.

Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause—

So have we all—of joy, for our escape

Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe

Is common; every day some sailor’s wife,

The masters of some merchant, and the merchant

Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle—

I mean our preservation—few in millions

Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh

Our sorrow with our comfort.

Sir—

When every grief is entertained that’s offered,

comes to th’ entertainer—

Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken

truer than you purposed.

Therefore, my lord—

Well, I have done. But yet—

Here is everything advantageous to life.

How lush and lusty the grass looks! How

green!

But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost

beyond credit—

That our garments, being, as they were,

drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their

freshness and gloss, being rather new-dyed than

stained with salt water.

Methinks our garments are now as fresh as

when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage

of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of

Tunis.

Not since widow Dido’s time.

This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

I assure you, Carthage.

Ay.

Sir, we were talking that our

garments seem now as fresh as when we were at

Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now

queen.

Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as

the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.

When I wore it at your daughter’s

marriage.

My lord Sebastian,

The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness

And time to speak it in. You rub the sore

When you should bring the plaster.

It is foul weather in us all, good sir,

When you are cloudy.

Had I plantation of this isle, my lord—

And were the king on ’t, what would I do?

I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries

Execute all things, for no kind of traffic

Would I admit; no name of magistrate;

Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,

And use of service, none; contract, succession,

Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;

No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;

No occupation; all men idle, all,

And women too, but innocent and pure;

No sovereignty—

All things in common nature should produce

Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,

Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine

Would I not have; but nature should bring forth

Of its own kind all foison, all abundance,

To feed my innocent people.

I would with such perfection govern, sir,

T’ excel the Golden Age.

And do you mark me, sir?

I do well believe your Highness, and did it to

minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of

such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use

to laugh at nothing.

Who in this kind of merry fooling am

nothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at

nothing still.

You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You

would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would

continue in it five weeks without changing.

No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my

discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep?

For I am very heavy.

Now, good angels preserve the

King!

What’s the matter?

Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming,

And that a strange one too, which did awake me.

I shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened,

I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,

That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,

Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons.

Heavens keep him from these beasts,

For he is, sure, i’ th’ island.

By ’r lakin, I can go no further, sir.

My old bones aches. Here’s a maze trod indeed

Through forthrights and meanders. By your patience,

I needs must rest me.

Marvelous sweet music!

If in Naples

I should report this now, would they believe me?

If I should say I saw such islanders—

For, certes, these are people of the island—

Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note

Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of

Our human generation you shall find

Many, nay, almost any.

Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,

Who would believe that there were mountaineers

Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em

Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men

Whose heads stood in their breasts? Which now we find

Each putter-out of five for one will bring us

Good warrant of.

I’ th’ name of something holy, sir, why stand you

In this strange stare?

All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt,

Like poison given to work a great time after,

Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you

That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly

And hinder them from what this ecstasy

May now provoke them to.

All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement

Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us

Out of this fearful country!

Whether this be

Or be not, I’ll not swear.

I have inly wept

Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,

And on this couple drop a blessèd crown,

For it is you that have chalked forth the way

Which brought us hither.

Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue

Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice

Beyond a common joy, and set it down

With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage

Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,

And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife

Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom

In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves

When no man was his own.

Be it so. Amen.

O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.

I prophesied if a gallows were on land,

This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,

That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?

Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
