


My lord ambassador these letters are for you

Sent from your brother Marquess Montague

These from our king unto your Majesty

And madam these for youfrom whom I know not

My sovereign liege no letters and few words

But such as I without your special pardon

Dare not relate

At my depart these were his very words

Go tell false Edward the supposd king

That Lewis of France is sending over maskers

To revel it with him and his new bride

These were her words uttered with mild disdain

Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly

I'll wear the willow garland for his sake

Tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done

And I am ready to put armor on

He more incensed against your Majesty

Than all the rest discharged me with these words

Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong

And therefore I'll uncrown him ere 't be long

Ay gracious sovereign they are so linked in friendship

That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter

That Edward is escapd from your brother

And fled as he hears since to Burgundy

He was conveyed by Richard Duke of Gloucester

And the Lord Hastings who attended him

In secret ambush on the forest side

And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescued him

For hunting was his daily exercise
