
Our hearts receive your warnings

O 'tis brave wars

I am your accessory And so farewell

Sweet Monsieur Parolles

Good my lord

The reasons of our state I cannot yield

But like a common and an outward man

That the great figure of a council frames

By self-unable motion therefore dare not

Say what I think of it since I have found

Myself in my incertain grounds to fail

As often as I guessed

If your Lordship find him not a hilding

hold me no more in your respect

It were fit you knew him lest reposing

too far in his virtue which he hath not he might

at some great and trusty business in a main danger

fail you

None better than to let him fetch off his

drum which you hear him so confidently undertake

to do

O for the love of laughter let him fetch

his drum He says he has a stratagem for 't When

your Lordship sees the bottom of his success in

't and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore

will be melted if you give him not John Drum's

entertainment your inclining cannot be removed

Here he comes

A pox on 't Let it go 'Tis but a drum

That was not to be blamed in the command

of the service It was a disaster of war that

Caesar himself could not have prevented if he had

been there to command

You do not know him my lord as we do

Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's

favor and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries

but when you find him out you have him

ever after

We'll make you some sport with the fox

ere we case him He was first smoked by the old

Lord Lafew When his disguise and he is parted

tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you

shall see this very night

But you say she's honest

With all my heart my lord

I have delivered it an hour since There

is something in 't that stings his nature for on the

reading it he changed almost into another man

Especially he hath incurred the everlasting

displeasure of the King who had even tuned

his bounty to sing happiness to him I will tell you

a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you

He hath perverted a young gentlewoman

here in Florence of a most chaste renown

and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her

honor He hath given her his monumental ring and

thinks himself made in the unchaste composition

Merely our own traitors And as in the

common course of all treasons we still see them

reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred

ends so he that in this action contrives against his

own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows

himself

Not till after midnight for he is dieted to

his hour

We will not meddle with him till he

come for his presence must be the whip of the

other

I hear there is an overture of peace

What will Count Rossillion do then

Will he travel higher or return again into France

Let it be forbid sir So should I be a

great deal of his act

How is this justified

Hath the Count all this intelligence

I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of

this

And how mightily some other times we

drown our gain in tears The great dignity that his

valor hath here acquired for him shall at home be

encountered with a shame as ample

They shall be no more than needful

there if they were more than they can commend

They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness

Here's his Lordship nowHow now my lord Is 't

not after midnight

If the business be of any difficulty and

this morning your departure hence it requires

haste of your Lordship

Bring him forth Has sat i' th' stocks all

night poor gallant knave

I have told your Lordship already the

stocks carry him But to answer you as you would

be understood he weeps like a wench that had

shed her milk He hath confessed himself to Morgan

whom he supposes to be a friar from the time

of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of

his setting i' th' stocks And what think you he hath

confessed

His confession is taken and it shall be

read to his face If your Lordship be in 't as I

believe you are you must have the patience to

hear it

I will never trust a man again for

keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have

everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly

This is your devoted friend sir

the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier

Why does he ask him of me

God bless you Captain Parolles

Captain what greeting will you to my

Lord Lafew I am for France
