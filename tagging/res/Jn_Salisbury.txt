


As true as I believe you think them false

That give you cause to prove my saying true.

What other harm have I, good lady, done

But spoke the harm that is by others done?

Pardon me, madam,

I may not go without you to the Kings.

Therefore, to be possessed with double pomp,

To guard a title that was rich before,

To gild refinèd gold, to paint the lily,

To throw a perfume on the violet,

To smooth the ice or add another hue

Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light

To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,

Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.

In this the antique and well-noted face

Of plain old form is much disfigurèd,

And like a shifted wind unto a sail,

It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,

Startles and frights consideration,

Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected

For putting on so new a fashioned robe.

To this effect, before you were new-crowned,

We breathed our counsel; but it pleased your Highness

To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,

Since all and every part of what we would

Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.

The color of the King doth come and go

Between his purpose and his conscience,

Like heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set.

His passion is so ripe it needs must break.

Indeed, we feared his sickness was past cure.

It is apparent foul play, and ’tis shame

That greatness should so grossly offer it.

So thrive it in your game, and so farewell.

Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;

It is our safety, and we must embrace

This gentle offer of the perilous time.

The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,

Whose private with me of the Dauphin’s love

Is much more general than these lines import.

Or rather then set forward, for ’twill be

Two long days’ journey, lords, or ere we meet.

The King hath dispossessed himself of us.

We will not line his thin bestainèd cloak

With our pure honors, nor attend the foot

That leaves the print of blood where’er it walks.

Return, and tell him so. We know the worst.

Our griefs and not our manners reason now.

This is the prison.  What is he lies here?

Murder, as hating what himself hath done,

Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.

Sir Richard, what think you? You have beheld.

Or have you read or heard, or could you think,

Or do you almost think, although you see,

That you do see? Could thought, without this object,

Form such another? This is the very top,

The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,

Of murder’s arms. This is the bloodiest shame,

The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke

That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage

Presented to the tears of soft remorse.

If that it be the work of any hand?

We had a kind of light what would ensue.

It is the shameful work of Hubert’s hand,

The practice and the purpose of the King,

From whose obedience I forbid my soul,

Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life

And breathing to his breathless excellence

The incense of a vow, a holy vow:

Never to taste the pleasures of the world,

Never to be infected with delight,

Nor conversant with ease and idleness,

Till I have set a glory to this hand

By giving it the worship of revenge.

O, he is bold and blushes not at death!—

Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!

Must I rob the law?

Not till I sheathe it in a murderer’s skin.

Thou art a murderer.

Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.

Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,

For villainy is not without such rheum,

And he, long traded in it, makes it seem

like rivers of remorse and innocency.

Away with me, all you whose souls abhor

Th’ uncleanly savors of a slaughterhouse,

For I am stifled with this smell of sin.

Upon our sides it never shall be broken.

And, noble dauphin, albeit we swear

A voluntary zeal and unurged faith

To your proceedings, yet believe me, prince,

I am not glad that such a sore of time

Should seek a plaster by contemned revolt

And heal the inveterate canker of one wound

By making many. O, it grieves my soul

That I must draw this metal from my side

To be a widow-maker! O, and there

Where honorable rescue and defense

Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!

But such is the infection of the time

That for the health and physic of our right,

We cannot deal but with the very hand

Of stern injustice and confusèd wrong.

And is ’t not pity, O my grievèd friends,

That we, the sons and children of this isle,

Was born to see so sad an hour as this,

Wherein we step after a stranger, march

Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up

Her enemies’ ranks? I must withdraw and weep

Upon the spot of this enforcèd cause,

To grace the gentry of a land remote,

And follow unacquainted colors here.

What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove,

That Neptune’s arms, who clippeth thee about,

Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself

And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,

Where these two Christian armies might combine

The blood of malice in a vein of league,

And not to spend it so unneighborly.

I did not think the King so stored with friends.

That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,

In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.

When we were happy, we had other names.

Wounded to death.

May this be possible? May this be true?

We do believe thee, and beshrew my soul

But I do love the favor and the form

Of this most fair occasion, by the which

We will untread the steps of damnèd flight,

And like a bated and retirèd flood,

Leaving our rankness and irregular course,

Stoop low within those bounds we have o’erlooked

And calmly run on in obedience

Even to our ocean, to our great King John.

My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,

For I do see the cruel pangs of death

Right in thine eye.—Away, my friends! New flight,

And happy newness, that intends old right.

Be of good comfort, prince, for you are born

To set a form upon that indigest

Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.

You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.—

My liege! My lord!—But now a king, now thus.

It seems you know not, then, so much as we.

The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,

Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,

And brings from him such offers of our peace

As we with honor and respect may take,

With purpose presently to leave this war.

Nay, ’tis in a manner done already,

For many carriages he hath dispatched

To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel

To the disposing of the Cardinal,

With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,

If you think meet, this afternoon will post

To consummate this business happily.

And the like tender of our love we make

To rest without a spot forevermore.
