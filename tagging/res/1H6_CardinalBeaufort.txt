


He was a king blest of the King of kings

Unto the French the dreadful Judgment Day

So dreadful will not be as was his sight

The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought

The Church's prayers made him so prosperous

Gloucester whate'er we like thou art Protector

And lookest to command the Prince and realm

Thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe

More than God or religious churchmen may

What Wherein Talbot overcame is 't so

Each hath his place and function to attend

I am left out for me nothing remains

But long I will not be Jack-out-of-office

The King from Eltham I intend to steal

And sit at chiefest stern of public weal

How now ambitious Humphrey what means this

I do thou most usurping proditor

And not Protectorof the King or realm

Nay stand thou back I will not budge a foot

This be Damascus be thou cursd Cain

To slay thy brother Abel if thou wilt

Do what thou dar'st I beard thee to thy face

Gloucester thou wilt answer this before the Pope

Here's Gloucester a foe to citizens

One that still motions war and never peace

O'ercharging your free purses with large fines

That seeks to overthrow religion

Because he is Protector of the realm

And would have armor here out of the Tower

To crown himself king and suppress the Prince

Gloucester we'll meet to thy cost be sure

Thy heartblood I will have for this day's work

Abominable Gloucester guard thy head

For I intend to have it ere long

Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines

With written pamphlets studiously devised

Humphrey of Gloucester if thou canst accuse

Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge

Do it without invention suddenly

As I with sudden and extemporal speech

Purpose to answer what thou canst object

Gloucester I do defy theeLords vouchsafe

To give me hearing what I shall reply

If I were covetous ambitious or perverse

As he will have me how am I so poor

Or how haps it I seek not to advance

Or raise myself but keep my wonted calling

And for dissension who preferreth peace

More than I do except I be provoked

No my good lords it is not that offends

It is not that that hath incensed the Duke

It is because no one should sway but he

No one but he should be about the King

And that engenders thunder in his breast

And makes him roar these accusations forth

But he shall know I am as good

Ay lordly sir for what are you I pray

But one imperious in another's throne

And am not I a prelate of the Church

Unreverent Gloucester

Rome shall remedy this

He shall submit or I will never yield

Well Duke of Gloucester I will yield to thee

Love for thy love and hand for hand I give

So help me God as I intend it not

As will the rest so willeth Winchester

Welcome high prince the mighty Duke of York

God save King Henry of that name the Sixth

Stay my Lord Legate you shall first receive

The sum of money which I promisd

Should be delivered to his Holiness

For clothing me in these grave ornaments

Now Winchester will not submit I trow

Or be inferior to the proudest peer

Humphrey of Gloucester thou shalt well perceive

That neither in birth or for authority

The Bishop will be overborne by thee

I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee

Or sack this country with a mutiny

Lord Regent I do greet your Excellence

With letters of commission from the King

For know my lords the states of Christendom

Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils

Have earnestly implored a general peace

Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French

And here at hand the Dauphin and his train

Approacheth to confer about some matter

Charles and the rest it is enacted thus

That in regard King Henry gives consent

Of mere compassion and of lenity

To ease your country of distressful war

And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace

You shall become true liegemen to his crown

And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear

To pay him tribute and submit thyself

Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him

And still enjoy thy regal dignity
