We did my lord weeping and commenting

Upon the sobbing deer

Who doth ambition shun

And loves to live i' th' sun

Seeking the food he eats

And pleased with what he gets

Come hither come hither come hither

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather

Yes sir

What shall he have that killed the deer

His leather skin and horns to wear

Then sing him home
