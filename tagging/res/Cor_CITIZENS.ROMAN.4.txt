You have deserved nobly of your

country, and you have not deserved nobly.

You have been a scourge to her enemies;

you have been a rod to her friends. You have

not indeed loved the common people.

You have received many wounds for

your country.

The gods give you joy, sir, heartily.

No, no. No man saw ’em.

We will so. Almost all

Repent in their election.
