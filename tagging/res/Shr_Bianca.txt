


Sister content you in my discontent

Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe

My books and instruments shall be my company

On them to look and practice by myself

Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself

To make a bondmaid and a slave of me

That I disdain But for these other goods

Unbind my hands I'll pull them off myself

Yea all my raiment to my petticoat

Or what you will command me will I do

So well I know my duty to my elders

Believe me sister of all the men alive

I never yet beheld that special face

Which I could fancy more than any other

If you affect him sister here I swear

I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him

Is it for him you do envy me so

Nay then you jest and now I well perceive

You have but jested with me all this while

I prithee sister Kate untie my hands

Why gentlemen you do me double wrong

To strive for that which resteth in my choice

I am no breeching scholar in the schools

I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times

But learn my lessons as I please myself

And to cut off all strife here sit we down

Take you your instrument play you the whiles

His lecture will be done ere you have tuned

Where left we last

Conster them

Let's hear Oh fie the treble jars

Now let me see if I can conster it Hic ibat

Simois I know you not hic est Sigeia tellus I trust

you not Hic steterat Priami take heed he hear us

not regia presume not celsa senis despair not

In time I may believe yet I mistrust

I must believe my master else I promise you

I should be arguing still upon that doubt

But let it restNow Litio to you

Good master take it not unkindly pray

That I have been thus pleasant with you both

Why I am past my gamut long ago

Gamut I am the ground of all accord

A re to plead Hortensio's passion

B mi Bianca take him for thy lord

C fa ut that loves with all affection

D sol re one clef two notes have I

E la mi show pity or I die

Call you this gamut Tut I like it not

Old fashions please me best I am not so nice

To change true rules for odd inventions

Farewell sweet masters both I must be gone

That being mad herself she's madly mated

What master read you First resolve me that

And may you prove sir master of your art

Tranio you jest But have you both forsworn me

God give him joy

He says so Tranio

The taming school What is there such a place

Pardon dear father

Cambio is changed into Lucentio

Head and butt An hasty-witted body

Would say your head and butt were head and horn

Ay but not frighted me Therefore I'll sleep again

Am I your bird I mean to shift my bush

And then pursue me as you draw your bow

You are welcome all

Fie what a foolish duty call you this

The more fool you for laying on my duty
