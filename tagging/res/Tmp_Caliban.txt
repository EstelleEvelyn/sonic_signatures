
There's wood enough within

As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed

With raven's feather from unwholesome fen

Drop on you both A southwest blow on you

And blister you all o'er

I must eat my dinner

This island's mine by Sycorax my mother

Which thou tak'st from me When thou cam'st first

Thou strok'st me and made much of me wouldst give me

Water with berries in 't and teach me how

To name the bigger light and how the less

That burn by day and night And then I loved thee

And showed thee all the qualities o' th' isle

The fresh springs brine pits barren place and fertile

Cursed be I that did so All the charms

Of Sycorax toads beetles bats light on you

For I am all the subjects that you have

Which first was mine own king and here you sty me

In this hard rock whiles you do keep from me

The rest o' th' island

O ho O ho Would 't had been done

Thou didst prevent me I had peopled else

This isle with Calibans

You taught me language and my profit on 't

Is I know how to curse The red plague rid you

For learning me your language

No pray thee

I must obey His art is of such power

It would control my dam's god Setebos

And make a vassal of him

All the infections that the sun sucks up

From bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him

By inchmeal a disease His spirits hear me

And yet I needs must curse But they'll nor pinch

Fright me with urchin-shows pitch me i' th' mire

Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark

Out of my way unless he bid 'em But

For every trifle are they set upon me

Sometimes like apes that mow and chatter at me

And after bite me then like hedgehogs which

Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount

Their pricks at my footfall Sometime am I

All wound with adders who with cloven tongues

Do hiss me into madness Lo now lo

Here comes a spirit of his and to torment me

For bringing wood in slowly I'll fall flat

Perchance he will not mind me

Do not torment me O

The spirit torments me O

Do not torment me prithee I'll bring my

wood home faster

Thou dost me yet but little hurt Thou wilt

anon I know it by thy trembling Now Prosper

works upon thee

These be fine things an if they be not

sprites That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor

I will kneel to him

I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true

subject for the liquor is not earthly

Hast thou not dropped from heaven

I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee

My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy

bush

I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island

and I will kiss thy foot I prithee be my god

I'll kiss thy foot I'll swear myself thy subject

I'll show thee the best springs I'll pluck thee berries

I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough

A plague upon the tyrant that I serve

I'll bear him no more sticks but follow thee

Thou wondrous man

I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow

And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts

Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how

To snare the nimble marmoset I'll bring thee

To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee

Young scamels from the rock Wilt thou go with me

Farewell master farewell farewell

No more dams I'll make for fish

Nor fetch in firing

At requiring

Nor scrape trenchering nor wash dish

'Ban 'ban Ca-caliban

Has a new master Get a new man

Freedom high-day High-day freedom Freedom

high-day freedom

How does thy Honor Let me lick thy shoe I'll

not serve him he is not valiant

Lo how he mocks me Wilt thou let him my

lord

Lo lo again Bite him to death I prithee

I thank my noble lord Wilt thou be pleased

to harken once again to the suit I made to thee

As I told thee before I am subject

to a tyrant a sorcerer that by his cunning hath

cheated me of the island

Thou liest thou jesting monkey

thou I would my valiant master would

destroy thee I do not lie

I say by sorcery he got this isle

From me he got it If thy Greatness will

Revenge it on him for I know thou dar'st

But this thing dare not

Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee

Yea yea my lord I'll yield him thee asleep

Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head

What a pied ninny's thisThou scurvy patch

I do beseech thy Greatness give him blows

And take his bottle from him When that's gone

He shall drink naught but brine for I'll not show him

Where the quick freshes are

Ha ha ha

Beat him enough After a little time

I'll beat him too

Why as I told thee 'tis a custom with him

I' th' afternoon to sleep There thou mayst brain him

Having first seized his books or with a log

Batter his skull or paunch him with a stake

Or cut his weasand with thy knife Remember

First to possess his books for without them

He's but a sot as I am nor hath not

One spirit to command They all do hate him

As rootedly as I Burn but his books

He has brave utensilsfor so he calls them

Which when he has a house he'll deck withal

And that most deeply to consider is

The beauty of his daughter He himself

Calls her a nonpareil I never saw a woman

But only Sycorax my dam and she

But she as far surpasseth Sycorax

As great'st does least

Ay lord she will become thy bed I warrant

And bring thee forth brave brood

Within this half hour will he be asleep

Wilt thou destroy him then

Thou mak'st me merry I am full of pleasure

Let us be jocund Will you troll the catch

You taught me but whilere

That's not the tune

Art thou afeard

Be not afeard The isle is full of noises

Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not

Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments

Will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices

That if I then had waked after long sleep

Will make me sleep again and then in dreaming

The clouds methought would open and show riches

Ready to drop upon me that when I waked

I cried to dream again

When Prospero is destroyed

Pray you tread softly that the blind mole

may not hear a footfall We now are near his cell

Good my lord give me thy favor still

Be patient for the prize I'll bring thee to

Shall hoodwink this mischance Therefore speak softly

All's hushed as midnight yet

Prithee my king be quiet Seest thou here

This is the mouth o' th' cell No noise and enter

Do that good mischief which may make this island

Thine own forever and I thy Caliban

For aye thy foot-licker

Let it alone thou fool It is but trash

The dropsy drown this fool What do you mean

To dote thus on such luggage Let 't alone

And do the murder first If he awake

From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches

Make us strange stuff

I will have none on 't We shall lose our time

And all be turned to barnacles or to apes

With foreheads villainous low

O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed How

fine my master is I am afraid he will chastise me

I shall be pinched to death

Ay that I will and I'll be wise hereafter

And seek for grace What a thrice-double ass

Was I to take this drunkard for a god

And worship this dull fool
