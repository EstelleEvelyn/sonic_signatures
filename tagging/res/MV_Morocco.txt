


Mislike me not for my complexion

The shadowed livery of the burnished sun

To whom I am a neighbor and near bred

Bring me the fairest creature northward born

Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles

And let us make incision for your love

To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine

I tell thee lady this aspect of mine

Hath feared the valiant by my love I swear

The best regarded virgins of our clime

Have loved it too I would not change this hue

Except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen

Even for that I thank you

Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets

To try my fortune By this scimitar

That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince

That won three fields of Sultan Solyman

I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look

Outbrave the heart most daring on the Earth

Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear

Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey

To win thee lady But alas the while

If Hercules and Lychas play at dice

Which is the better man the greater throw

May turn by fortune from the weaker hand

So is Alcides beaten by his page

And so may I blind Fortune leading me

Miss that which one unworthier may attain

And die with grieving

Nor will not Come bring me unto my chance

Good fortune then

To make me blestor cursed'st among men

This first of gold who this inscription bears

Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire

The second silver which this promise carries

Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves

This third dull lead with warning all as blunt

Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath

How shall I know if I do choose the right

Some god direct my judgment Let me see

I will survey th' inscriptions back again

What says this leaden casket

Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath

Must givefor what For lead Hazard for lead

This casket threatens Men that hazard all

Do it in hope of fair advantages

A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross

I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead

What says the silver with her virgin hue

Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves

As much as he deservespause there Morocco

And weigh thy value with an even hand

If thou beest rated by thy estimation

Thou dost deserve enough and yet enough

May not extend so far as to the lady

And yet to be afeard of my deserving

Were but a weak disabling of myself

As much as I deservewhy that's the lady

I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes

In graces and in qualities of breeding

But more than these in love I do deserve

What if I strayed no farther but chose here

Let's see once more this saying graved in gold

Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire

Why that's the lady All the world desires her

From the four corners of the Earth they come

To kiss this shrine this mortal breathing saint

The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds

Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now

For princes to come view fair Portia

The watery kingdom whose ambitious head

Spets in the face of heaven is no bar

To stop the foreign spirits but they come

As o'er a brook to see fair Portia

One of these three contains her heavenly picture

Is 't like that lead contains her 'Twere damnation

To think so base a thought It were too gross

To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave

Or shall I think in silver she's immured

Being ten times undervalued to tried gold

O sinful thought Never so rich a gem

Was set in worse than gold They have in England

A coin that bears the figure of an angel

Stamped in gold but that's insculped upon

But here an angel in a golden bed

Lies all withinDeliver me the key

Here do I choose and thrive I as I may

O hell What have we here

A carrion death within whose empty eye

There is a written scroll I'll read the writing

All that glisters is not gold

Often have you heard that told

Many a man his life hath sold

But my outside to behold

Gilded tombs do worms infold

Had you been as wise as bold

Young in limbs in judgment old

Your answer had not been enscrolled

Fare you well your suit is cold

Cold indeed and labor lost

Then farewell heat and welcome frost

Portia adieu I have too grieved a heart

To take a tedious leave Thus losers part
