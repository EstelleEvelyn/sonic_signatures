Thou hast a servant named Lucilius

Most noble Timon call the man before thee

This fellow here Lord Timon this thy creature

By night frequents my house I am a man

That from my first have been inclined to thrift

And my estate deserves an heir more raised

Than one which holds a trencher

One only daughter have I no kin else

On whom I may confer what I have got

The maid is fair o' th' youngest for a bride

And I have bred her at my dearest cost

In qualities of the best This man of thine

Attempts her love I prithee noble lord

Join with me to forbid him her resort

Myself have spoke in vain

Therefore he will be Timon

His honesty rewards him in itself

It must not bear my daughter

She is young and apt

Our own precedent passions do instruct us

What levity's in youth

If in her marriage my consent be missing

I call the gods to witnessI will choose

Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world

And dispossess her all

Three talents on the present in future all

Most noble lord

Pawn me to this your honor she is his
