Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down

And being prostrate thus he bade me say

Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest

Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving

Say I love Brutus and I honor him

Say I feared Caesar honored him and loved him

If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony

May safely come to him and be resolved

How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death

Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead

So well as Brutus living but will follow

The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus

Thorough the hazards of this untrod state

With all true faith So says my master Antony

I'll fetch him presently
