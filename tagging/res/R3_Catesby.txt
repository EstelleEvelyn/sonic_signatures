


Madam his Majesty doth call for you

And for your Graceand yours my gracious lords

He for his father's sake so loves the Prince

That he will not be won to aught against him

He will do all in all as Hastings doth

My good lords both with all the heed I can

You shall my lord

Many good morrows to my noble lord

It is a reeling world indeed my lord

And I believe will never stand upright

Till Richard wear the garland of the realm

Ay my good lord

Ay on my life and hopes to find you forward

Upon his party for the gain thereof

And thereupon he sends you this good news

That this same very day your enemies

The kindred of the Queen must die at Pomfret

God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind

'Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord

When men are unprepared and look not for it

The Princes both make high account of you

For they account his head upon the Bridge

He doth entreat your Grace my noble lord

To visit him tomorrow or next day

He is within with two right reverend fathers

Divinely bent to meditation

And in no worldly suits would he be moved

To draw him from his holy exercise

I'll signify so much unto him straight

He wonders to what end you have assembled

Such troops of citizens to come to him

His Grace not being warned thereof before

He fears my lord you mean no good to him

O make them joyful Grant their lawful suit

Call him again sweet prince Accept their suit

If you deny them all the land will rue it

Amen

The King is angry See he gnaws his lip

Here my good lord

I will my lord with all convenient haste

First mighty liege tell me your Highness' pleasure

What from your Grace I shall deliver to him

I go

My liege the Duke of Buckingham is taken

That is the best news That the Earl of Richmond

Is with a mighty power landed at Milford

Is colder tidings yet they must be told

It's suppertime my lord It's nine o'clock

It is my liege and all things are in readiness

My lord

Rescue my lord of Norfolk rescue rescue

The King enacts more wonders than a man

Daring an opposite to every danger

His horse is slain and all on foot he fights

Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death

Rescue fair lord or else the day is lost

Withdraw my lord I'll help you to a horse
