Alas a black ousel cousin Shallow

Indeed sir to my cost

You were called Lusty Shallow then

cousin

This Sir John cousin that comes hither anon

about soldiers

We shall all follow cousin

By my troth cousin I was not there

Dead sir

Thereafter as they be a score of good ewes

may be worth ten pounds

Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men as I

think

Your good Worship is welcome

That's fifty-five year ago

Ah sirrah quoth he we shall

Do nothing but eat and make good cheer

And praise God for the merry year

When flesh is cheap and females dear

And lusty lads roam here and there

So merrily

And ever among so merrily

Be merry be merry my wife has all

For women are shrews both short and tall

'Tis merry in hall when beards wags all

And welcome merry Shrovetide

Be merry be merry

Who I I have been merry twice and once ere

now

A cup of wine that's brisk and fine

And drink unto thee leman mine

And a merry heart lives long-a

And we shall be merry now comes in the

sweet o' th' night

Fill the cup and let it come

I'll pledge you a mile to th' bottom

Do me right

And dub me knight

Samingo

Is 't not so

Is 't so Why then say an old man can do

somewhat

By 'r Lady I think he be but Goodman Puff of

Barson

And Robin Hood Scarlet and John
