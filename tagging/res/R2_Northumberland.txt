


My liege old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty

Nay nothing all is said

His tongue is now a stringless instrument

Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent

Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead

Richly in both if justice had her right

Nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more

That speaks thy words again to do thee harm

Now afore God 'tis shame such wrongs are borne

In him a royal prince and many more

Of noble blood in this declining land

The King is not himself but basely led

By flatterers and what they will inform

Merely in hate 'gainst any of us all

That will the King severely prosecute

'Gainst us our lives our children and our heirs

Wars hath not wasted it for warred he hath not

But basely yielded upon compromise

That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows

More hath he spent in peace than they in wars

Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him

His noble kinsman Most degenerate king

But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing

Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm

We see the wind sit sore upon our sails

And yet we strike not but securely perish

Not so Even through the hollow eyes of death

I spy life peering but I dare not say

How near the tidings of our comfort is

Then thus I have from Le Port Blanc

A bay in Brittany received intelligence

That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham

That late broke from the Duke of Exeter

His brother archbishop late of Canterbury

Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston

Sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Coint

All these well furnished by the Duke of Brittany

With eight tall ships three thousand men of war

Are making hither with all due expedience

And shortly mean to touch our northern shore

Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay

The first departing of the King for Ireland

If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke

Imp out our drooping country's broken wing

Redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown

Wipe off the dust that hides our scepter's gilt

And make high majesty look like itself

Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh

But if you faint as fearing to do so

Stay and be secret and myself will go

Believe me noble lord

I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire

These high wild hills and rough uneven ways

Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome

And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar

Making the hard way sweet and delectable

But I bethink me what a weary way

From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found

In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company

Which I protest hath very much beguiled

The tediousness and process of my travel

But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have

The present benefit which I possess

And hope to joy is little less in joy

Than hope enjoyed By this the weary lords

Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done

By sight of what I have your noble company

It is my son young Harry Percy

Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever

Harry how fares your uncle

Why is he not with the Queen

What was his reason He was not so resolved

When last we spake together

Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy

Then learn to know him now This is the Duke

How far is it to Berkeley and what stir

Keeps good old York there with his men of war

Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby

Bloody with spurring fiery red with haste

It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess

The noble duke hath been too much abused

The noble duke hath sworn his coming is

But for his own and for the right of that

We all have strongly sworn to give him aid

And let him never see joy that breaks that oath

The news is very fair and good my lord

Richard not far from hence hath hid his head

Your Grace mistakes only to be brief

Left I his title out

O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle

The King of heaven forbid our lord the King

Should so with civil and uncivil arms

Be rushed upon Thy thrice-noble cousin

Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand

And by the honorable tomb he swears

That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones

And by the royalties of both your bloods

Currents that spring from one most gracious head

And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt

And by the worth and honor of himself

Comprising all that may be sworn or said

His coming hither hath no further scope

Than for his lineal royalties and to beg

Enfranchisement immediate on his knees

Which on thy royal party granted once

His glittering arms he will commend to rust

His barbd steeds to stables and his heart

To faithful service of your Majesty

This swears he as he is a prince and just

And as I am a gentleman I credit him

My lord in the base court he doth attend

To speak with you may it please you to come down

Sorrow and grief of heart

Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man

Yet he is come

Well have you argued sir and for your pains

Of capital treason we arrest you here

My Lord of Westminster be it your charge

To keep him safely till his day of trial

May it please you lords to grant the commons' suit

 No more but that you read

These accusations and these grievous crimes

Committed by your person and your followers

Against the state and profit of this land

That by confessing them the souls of men

May deem that you are worthily deposed

My lord dispatch Read o'er these articles

My lord

Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come

The commons will not then be satisfied

My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changed

You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower

And madam there is order ta'en for you

With all swift speed you must away to France

My guilt be on my head and there an end

Take leave and part for you must part forthwith

That were some love but little policy

First to thy sacred state wish I all happiness

The next news is I have to London sent

The heads of Oxford Salisbury Blunt and Kent

The manner of their taking may appear

At large discoursd in this paper here
