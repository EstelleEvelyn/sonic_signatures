given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and

Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.

Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news

abroad?—I mean the whispered ones, for they are

yet but ear-kissing arguments.

Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt

the dukes of Cornwall and Albany?

You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
