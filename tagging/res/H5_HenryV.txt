


Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?

Send for him, good uncle.

Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved,

Before we hear him, of some things of weight

That task our thoughts concerning us and France.

Sure we thank you.

My learnèd lord, we pray you to proceed

And justly and religiously unfold

Why the law Salic that they have in France

Or should or should not bar us in our claim.

And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,

That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,

Or nicely charge your understanding soul

With opening titles miscreate, whose right

Suits not in native colors with the truth;

For God doth know how many now in health

Shall drop their blood in approbation

Of what your reverence shall incite us to.

Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,

How you awake our sleeping sword of war.

We charge you in the name of God, take heed,

For never two such kingdoms did contend

Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops

Are every one a woe, a sore complaint

’Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords

That makes such waste in brief mortality.

Under this conjuration, speak, my lord,

For we will hear, note, and believe in heart

That what you speak is in your conscience washed

As pure as sin with baptism.

May I with right and conscience make this claim?

We must not only arm t’ invade the French,

But lay down our proportions to defend

Against the Scot, who will make road upon us

With all advantages.

We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,

But fear the main intendment of the Scot,

Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.

For you shall read that my great-grandfather

Never went with his forces into France

But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom

Came pouring like the tide into a breach

With ample and brim fullness of his force,

Galling the gleanèd land with hot assays,

Girding with grievous siege castles and towns,

That England, being empty of defense,

Hath shook and trembled at th’ ill neighborhood.

Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.

Now are we well resolved, and by God’s help

And yours, the noble sinews of our power,

France being ours, we’ll bend it to our awe

Or break it all to pieces. Or there we’ll sit,

Ruling in large and ample empery

O’er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,

Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,

Tombless, with no remembrance over them.

Either our history shall with full mouth

Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,

Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,

Not worshiped with a waxen epitaph.

Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure

Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear

Your greeting is from him, not from the King.

We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,

Unto whose grace our passion is as subject

As is our wretches fettered in our prisons.

Therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness

Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.

What treasure, uncle?

We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.

His present and your pains we thank you for.

When we have matched our rackets to these balls,

We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set

Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.

Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler

That all the courts of France will be disturbed

With chases. And we understand him well,

How he comes o’er us with our wilder days,

Not measuring what use we made of them.

We never valued this poor seat of England,

And therefore, living hence, did give ourself

To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common

That men are merriest when they are from home.

But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,

Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness

When I do rouse me in my throne of France,

For that I have laid by my majesty

And plodded like a man for working days;

But I will rise there with so full a glory

That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,

Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.

And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his

Hath turned his balls to gun-stones, and his soul

Shall stand sore chargèd for the wasteful vengeance

That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows

Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,

Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;

And some are yet ungotten and unborn

That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.

But this lies all within the will of God,

To whom I do appeal, and in whose name

Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,

To venge me as I may and to put forth

My rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause.

So get you hence in peace. And tell the Dauphin

His jest will savor but of shallow wit

When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.—

Convey them with safe conduct.—Fare you well.

We hope to make the sender blush at it.

Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour

That may give furth’rance to our expedition;

For we have now no thought in us but France,

Save those to God, that run before our business.

Therefore let our proportions for these wars

Be soon collected, and all things thought upon

That may with reasonable swiftness add

More feathers to our wings. For, God before,

We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door.

Therefore let every man now task his thought,

That this fair action may on foot be brought.

Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.—

My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,

And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.

Think you not that the powers we bear with us

Will cut their passage through the force of France,

Doing the execution and the act

For which we have in head assembled them?

I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded

We carry not a heart with us from hence

That grows not in a fair consent with ours,

Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish

Success and conquest to attend on us.

We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,

And shall forget the office of our hand

Sooner than quittance of desert and merit

According to the weight and worthiness.

We judge no less.—Uncle of Exeter,

Enlarge the man committed yesterday

That railed against our person. We consider

It was excess of wine that set him on,

And on his more advice we pardon him.

O, let us yet be merciful.

Alas, your too much love and care of me

Are heavy orisons ’gainst this poor wretch.

If little faults proceeding on distemper

Shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye

When capital crimes, chewed, swallowed, and digested,

Appear before us? We’ll yet enlarge that man,

Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care

And tender preservation of our person,

Would have him punished. And now to our French causes.

Who are the late commissioners?

Then Richard, Earl of Cambridge, there is yours—

There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham.—And, sir knight,

Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours.—

Read them, and know I know your worthiness.—

My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter,

We will aboard tonight.—Why how now, gentlemen?

What see you in those papers, that you lose

So much complexion?—Look you, how they change.

Their cheeks are paper.—Why, what read you there

That have so cowarded and chased your blood

Out of appearance?

The mercy that was quick in us but late

By your own counsel is suppressed and killed.

You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,

For your own reasons turn into your bosoms

As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.—

See you, my princes and my noble peers,

These English monsters. My Lord of Cambridge here,

You know how apt our love was to accord

To furnish him with all appurtenants

Belonging to his honor, and this man

Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired

And sworn unto the practices of France

To kill us here in Hampton; to the which

This knight, no less for bounty bound to us

Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.—But O,

What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,

Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?

Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,

That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,

That almost mightst have coined me into gold,

Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use—

May it be possible that foreign hire

Could out of thee extract one spark of evil

That might annoy my finger? ’Tis so strange

That, though the truth of it stands off as gross

As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.

Treason and murder ever kept together,

As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,

Working so grossly in a natural cause

That admiration did not whoop at them.

But thou, ’gainst all proportion, didst bring in

Wonder to wait on treason and on murder,

And whatsoever cunning fiend it was

That wrought upon thee so preposterously

Hath got the voice in hell for excellence.

All other devils that suggest by treasons

Do botch and bungle up damnation

With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched

From glist’ring semblances of piety;

But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,

Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,

Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.

If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus

Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,

He might return to vasty Tartar back

And tell the legions “I can never win

A soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”

O, how hast thou with jealousy infected

The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?

Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learnèd?

Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?

Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?

Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,

Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,

Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,

Garnished and decked in modest complement,

Not working with the eye without the ear,

And but in purgèd judgment trusting neither?

Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.

And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot

To mark the full-fraught man and best endued

With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,

For this revolt of thine methinks is like

Another fall of man.—Their faults are open.

Arrest them to the answer of the law,

And God acquit them of their practices.

God quit you in His mercy. Hear your sentence:

You have conspired against our royal person,

Joined with an enemy proclaimed, and from his coffers

Received the golden earnest of our death,

Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,

His princes and his peers to servitude,

His subjects to oppression and contempt,

And his whole kingdom into desolation.

Touching our person, seek we no revenge,

But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender,

Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws

We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,

Poor miserable wretches, to your death,

The taste whereof God of His mercy give

You patience to endure, and true repentance

Of all your dear offenses.—Bear them hence.

Now, lords, for France, the enterprise whereof

Shall be to you as us, like glorious.

We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,

Since God so graciously hath brought to light

This dangerous treason lurking in our way

To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now

But every rub is smoothèd on our way.

Then forth, dear countrymen. Let us deliver

Our puissance into the hand of God,

Putting it straight in expedition.

Cheerly to sea. The signs of war advance.

No king of England if not king of France.

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,

Or close the wall up with our English dead!

In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man

As modest stillness and humility,

But when the blast of war blows in our ears,

Then imitate the action of the tiger:

Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,

Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage,

Then lend the eye a terrible aspect,

Let it pry through the portage of the head

Like the brass cannon, let the brow o’erwhelm it

As fearfully as doth a gallèd rock

O’erhang and jutty his confounded base

Swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.

Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide,

Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit

To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,

Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof,

Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,

Have in these parts from morn till even fought,

And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.

Dishonor not your mothers. Now attest

That those whom you called fathers did beget you.

Be copy now to men of grosser blood

And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,

Whose limbs were made in England, show us here

The mettle of your pasture. Let us swear

That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not,

For there is none of you so mean and base

That hath not noble luster in your eyes.

I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,

Straining upon the start. The game’s afoot.

Follow your spirit, and upon this charge

Cry “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”

How yet resolves the Governor of the town?

This is the latest parle we will admit.

Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves

Or, like to men proud of destruction,

Defy us to our worst. For, as I am a soldier,

A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,

If I begin the batt’ry once again,

I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur

Till in her ashes she lie burièd.

The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,

And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,

In liberty of bloody hand, shall range

With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass

Your fresh fair virgins and your flow’ring infants.

What is it then to me if impious war,

Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends,

Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats

Enlinked to waste and desolation?

What is ’t to me, when you yourselves are cause,

If your pure maidens fall into the hand

Of hot and forcing violation?

What rein can hold licentious wickedness

When down the hill he holds his fierce career?

We may as bootless spend our vain command

Upon th’ enragèd soldiers in their spoil

As send precepts to the Leviathan

To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,

Take pity of your town and of your people

Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command,

Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace

O’erblows the filthy and contagious clouds

Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy.

If not, why, in a moment look to see

The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand

Desire the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters,

Your fathers taken by the silver beards

And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls,

Your naked infants spitted upon pikes

Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused

Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry

At Herod’s bloody-hunting slaughtermen.

What say you? Will you yield and this avoid

Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?

Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,

Go you and enter Harfleur. There remain,

And fortify it strongly ’gainst the French.

Use mercy to them all for us, dear uncle.

The winter coming on and sickness growing

Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.

Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest.

Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.

How now, Fluellen, cam’st thou from the

bridge?

What men have you lost, Fluellen?

We would have all such offenders so cut

off; and we give express charge that in our marches

through the country there be nothing compelled

from the villages, nothing taken but paid for,

none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful

language; for when lenity and cruelty play

for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest

winner.

Well then, I know thee. What shall I know

of thee?

Unfold it.

What is thy name? I know thy quality.

Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,

And tell thy king I do not seek him now

But could be willing to march on to Calais

Without impeachment, for, to say the sooth,

Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much

Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,

My people are with sickness much enfeebled,

My numbers lessened, and those few I have

Almost no better than so many French,

Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,

I thought upon one pair of English legs

Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgive me, God,

That I do brag thus. This your air of France

Hath blown that vice in me. I must repent.

Go therefore, tell thy master: here I am.

My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,

My army but a weak and sickly guard,

Yet, God before, tell him we will come on

Though France himself and such another neighbor

Stand in our way. There’s for thy labor, Montjoy.

Go bid thy master well advise himself:

If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,

We shall your tawny ground with your red blood

Discolor. And so, Montjoy, fare you well.

The sum of all our answer is but this:

We would not seek a battle as we are,

Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.

So tell your master.

We are in God’s hand, brother, not in theirs.

March to the bridge. It now draws toward night.

Beyond the river we’ll encamp ourselves,

And on tomorrow bid them march away.

Gloucester, ’tis true that we are in great danger.

The greater therefore should our courage be.—

Good morrow, brother Bedford. God almighty,

There is some soul of goodness in things evil,

Would men observingly distill it out.

For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers,

Which is both healthful and good husbandry.

Besides, they are our outward consciences

And preachers to us all, admonishing

That we should dress us fairly for our end.

Thus may we gather honey from the weed

And make a moral of the devil himself.

Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.

A good soft pillow for that good white head

Were better than a churlish turf of France.

’Tis good for men to love their present pains

Upon example. So the spirit is eased;

And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt,

The organs, though defunct and dead before,

Break up their drowsy grave and newly move

With casted slough and fresh legerity.

Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.  Brothers both,

Commend me to the princes in our camp,

Do my good morrow to them, and anon

Desire them all to my pavilion.

No, my good knight.

Go with my brothers to my lords of England.

I and my bosom must debate awhile,

And then I would no other company.

God-a-mercy, old heart, thou speak’st cheerfully.

A friend.

I am a gentleman of a company.

Even so. What are you?

Then you are a better than the King.

Harry le Roy.

No, I am a Welshman.

Yes.

Do not you wear your dagger in your cap

that day, lest he knock that about yours.

And his kinsman too.

I thank you. God be with you.

It sorts well with your fierceness.

Though it appear a little out of fashion,

There is much care and valor in this Welshman.

A friend.

Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

Even as men wracked upon a sand, that

look to be washed off the next tide.

No. Nor it is not meet he should, for,

though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a

man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to

me. The element shows to him as it doth to me. All

his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies

laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man,

and though his affections are higher mounted than

ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like

wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we

do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as

ours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him

with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,

should dishearten his army.

By my troth, I will speak my conscience

of the King. I think he would not wish himself

anywhere but where he is.

I dare say you love him not so ill to wish

him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel

other men’s minds. Methinks I could not die anywhere

so contented as in the King’s company, his

cause being just and his quarrel honorable.

So, if a son that is by his father sent about

merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea,

the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,

should be imposed upon his father that sent him.

Or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting

a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and

die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the

business of the master the author of the servant’s

damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound

to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the

father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for

they purpose not their death when they purpose

their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause

never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of

swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.

Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of

premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling

virgins with the broken seals of perjury;

some, making the wars their bulwark, that have

before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage

and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the

law and outrun native punishment, though they can

outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.

War is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here

men are punished for before-breach of the King’s

laws in now the King’s quarrel. Where they feared

the death, they have borne life away; and where they

would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided,

no more is the King guilty of their damnation

than he was before guilty of those impieties for the

which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is

the King’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.

Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as

every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of

his conscience. And, dying so, death is to him

advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost

wherein such preparation was gained. And in him

that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making

God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to

see His greatness and to teach others how they

should prepare.

I myself heard the King say he would not

be ransomed.

If I live to see it, I will never trust his

word after.

Your reproof is something too round. I

should be angry with you if the time were

convenient.

I embrace it.

Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear

it in my bonnet. Then, if ever thou dar’st acknowledge

it, I will make it my quarrel.

There.

If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.

Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the

King’s company.

Indeed, the French may lay twenty

French crowns to one they will beat us, for they

bear them on their shoulders. But it is no English

treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the

King himself will be a clipper.

Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls, our

debts, our careful wives, our children, and our sins,

lay on the King!

We must bear all. O hard condition,

Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath

Of every fool whose sense no more can feel

But his own wringing. What infinite heart’s ease

Must kings neglect that private men enjoy?

And what have kings that privates have not too,

Save ceremony, save general ceremony?

And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?

What kind of god art thou that suffer’st more

Of mortal griefs than do thy worshipers?

What are thy rents? What are thy comings-in?

O ceremony, show me but thy worth!

What is thy soul of adoration?

Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form,

Creating awe and fear in other men,

Wherein thou art less happy, being feared,

Than they in fearing?

What drink’st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,

But poisoned flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,

And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!

Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out

With titles blown from adulation?

Will it give place to flexure and low bending?

Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s knee,

Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,

That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose.

I am a king that find thee, and I know

’Tis not the balm, the scepter, and the ball,

The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,

The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,

The farcèd title running ’fore the King,

The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp

That beats upon the high shore of this world;

No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,

Not all these, laid in bed majestical,

Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave

Who, with a body filled and vacant mind,

Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread;

Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,

But, like a lackey, from the rise to set

Sweats in the eye of Phoebus, and all night

Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn

Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,

And follows so the ever-running year

With profitable labor to his grave.

And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,

Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,

Had the forehand and vantage of a king.

The slave, a member of the country’s peace,

Enjoys it, but in gross brain little wots

What watch the King keeps to maintain the peace,

Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

Good old knight,

Collect them all together at my tent.

I’ll be before thee.

O God of battles, steel my soldiers’ hearts.

Possess them not with fear. Take from them now

The sense of reck’ning or th’ opposèd numbers

Pluck their hearts from them. Not today, O Lord,

O, not today, think not upon the fault

My father made in compassing the crown.

I Richard’s body have interrèd new

And on it have bestowed more contrite tears

Than from it issued forcèd drops of blood.

Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay

Who twice a day their withered hands hold up

Toward heaven to pardon blood. And I have built

Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests

Sing still for Richard’s soul. More will I do—

Though all that I can do is nothing worth,

Since that my penitence comes after all,

Imploring pardon.

My brother Gloucester’s voice.—Ay,

I know thy errand. I will go with thee.

The day, my friends, and all things stay for me.

What’s he that wishes so?

My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin.

If we are marked to die, we are enough

To do our country loss; and if to live,

The fewer men, the greater share of honor.

God’s will, I pray thee wish not one man more.

By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,

Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;

It yearns me not if men my garments wear;

Such outward things dwell not in my desires.

But if it be a sin to covet honor,

I am the most offending soul alive.

No, ’faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.

God’s peace, I would not lose so great an honor

As one man more, methinks, would share from me,

For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!

Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,

That he which hath no stomach to this fight,

Let him depart. His passport shall be made,

And crowns for convoy put into his purse.

We would not die in that man’s company

That fears his fellowship to die with us.

This day is called the feast of Crispian.

He that outlives this day and comes safe home

Will stand o’ tiptoe when this day is named

And rouse him at the name of Crispian.

He that shall see this day, and live old age,

Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors

And say “Tomorrow is Saint Crispian.”

Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.

Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,

But he’ll remember with advantages

What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,

Familiar in his mouth as household words,

Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,

Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,

Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.

This story shall the good man teach his son,

And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,

From this day to the ending of the world,

But we in it shall be rememberèd—

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;

For he today that sheds his blood with me

Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,

This day shall gentle his condition;

And gentlemen in England now abed

Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,

And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks

That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.

All things are ready if our minds be so.

Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?

Why, now thou hast unwished five thousand men,

Which likes me better than to wish us one.—

You know your places. God be with you all.

Who hath sent thee now?

I pray thee bear my former answer back.

Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.

Good God, why should they mock poor fellows thus?

The man that once did sell the lion’s skin

While the beast lived was killed with hunting him.

A many of our bodies shall no doubt

Find native graves, upon the which, I trust,

Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work.

And those that leave their valiant bones in France,

Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,

They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them

And draw their honors reeking up to heaven,

Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,

The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.

Mark, then, abounding valor in our English,

That being dead, like to the bullet’s crazing,

Break out into a second course of mischief,

Killing in relapse of mortality.

Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable

We are but warriors for the working day;

Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched

With rainy marching in the painful field.

There’s not a piece of feather in our host—

Good argument, I hope, we will not fly—

And time hath worn us into slovenry.

But, by the Mass, our hearts are in the trim,

And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night

They’ll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck

The gay new coats o’er the French soldiers’ heads

And turn them out of service. If they do this,

As, if God please, they shall, my ransom then

Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labor.

Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.

They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints,

Which, if they have, as I will leave ’em them,

Shall yield them little, tell the Constable.

I fear thou wilt once more come again

for a ransom.

Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away,

And how Thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.

Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen,

But all’s not done. Yet keep the French the field.

Lives he, good uncle? Thrice within this hour

I saw him down, thrice up again and fighting.

From helmet to the spur, all blood he was.

I blame you not,

For, hearing this, I must perforce compound

With my full eyes, or they will issue too.

But hark, what new alarum is this same?

The French have reinforced their scattered men.

Then every soldier kill his prisoners.

Give the word through.

I was not angry since I came to France

Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald.

Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill.

If they will fight with us, bid them come down,

Or void the field. They do offend our sight.

If they’ll do neither, we will come to them

And make them skirr away as swift as stones

Enforcèd from the old Assyrian slings.

Besides, we’ll cut the throats of those we have,

And not a man of them that we shall take

Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.

How now, what means this, herald? Know’st thou not

That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?

Com’st thou again for ransom?

I tell thee truly, herald,

I know not if the day be ours or no,

For yet a many of your horsemen peer

And gallop o’er the field.

Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!

What is this castle called that stands hard by?

Then call we this the field of Agincourt,

Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

They did, Fluellen.

I wear it for a memorable honor,

For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.

Thanks, good my countryman.

God keep me so.—Our heralds, go with him.

Bring me just notice of the numbers dead

On both our parts.     Call yonder fellow hither.

Soldier, why wear’st thou that glove in thy

cap?

An Englishman?

What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit

this soldier keep his oath?

It may be his enemy is a gentleman of

great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.

Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou

meet’st the fellow.

Who serv’st thou under?

Call him hither to me, soldier.

Here,

Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me, and stick it in

thy cap. When Alençon and myself were down

together, I plucked this glove from his helm. If any

man challenge this, he is a friend to Alençon and an

enemy to our person. If thou encounter any such,

apprehend him, an thou dost me love.

Know’st thou Gower?

Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to

my tent.

My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester,

Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.

The glove which I have given him for a favor

May haply purchase him a box o’ th’ ear.

It is the soldier’s. I by bargain should

Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick.

If that the soldier strike him, as I judge

By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,

Some sudden mischief may arise of it,

For I do know Fluellen valiant

And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,

And quickly will return an injury.

Follow, and see there be no harm between them.—

Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.

How now, what’s the matter?

Give me thy glove, soldier.

Look, here is the fellow of it.

’Twas I indeed thou promised’st to strike,

And thou hast given me most bitter terms.

How canst thou make me

satisfaction?

It was ourself thou didst abuse.

Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns

And give it to this fellow.—Keep it, fellow,

And wear it for an honor in thy cap

Till I do challenge it.—Give him the crowns.—

And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

Now, herald, are the dead numbered?

What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?

This note doth tell me of ten thousand French

That in the field lie slain. Of princes in this number

And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead

One hundred twenty-six. Added to these,

Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,

Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which

Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights.

So that in these ten thousand they have lost,

There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries.

The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,

And gentlemen of blood and quality.

The names of those their nobles that lie dead:

Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France;

Jacques of Chatillon, Admiral of France;

The Master of the Crossbows, Lord Rambures;

Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dauphin;

John, Duke of Alençon; Anthony, Duke of Brabant,

The brother to the Duke of Burgundy;

And Edward, Duke of Bar. Of lusty earls:

Grandpré and Roussi, Faulconbridge and Foix,

Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.

Here was a royal fellowship of death.

Where is the number of our English dead?

Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,

Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire;

None else of name, and of all other men

But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here,

And not to us, but to thy arm alone

Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,

But in plain shock and even play of battle,

Was ever known so great and little loss

On one part and on th’ other? Take it, God,

For it is none but thine.

Come, go we in procession to the village,

And be it death proclaimèd through our host

To boast of this or take that praise from God

Which is His only.

Yes, captain, but with this acknowledgment:

That God fought for us.

Do we all holy rites.

Let there be sung Non nobis, and Te Deum,

The dead with charity enclosed in clay,

And then to Calais, and to England then,

Where ne’er from France arrived more happy men.

Peace to this meeting wherefor we are met.

Unto our brother France and to our sister,

Health and fair time of day.—Joy and good wishes

To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine.—

And, as a branch and member of this royalty,

By whom this great assembly is contrived,

We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.—

And princes French, and peers, health to you all.

To cry “Amen” to that, thus we appear.

If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,

Whose want gives growth to th’ imperfections

Which you have cited, you must buy that peace

With full accord to all our just demands,

Whose tenors and particular effects

You have, enscheduled briefly, in your hands.

Well then, the peace which you before so urged

Lies in his answer.

Brother, we shall.—Go, uncle Exeter,

And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,

Warwick, and Huntington, go with the King,

And take with you free power to ratify,

Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best

Shall see advantageable for our dignity,

Anything in or out of our demands,

And we’ll consign thereto.—Will you, fair sister,

Go with the princes or stay here with us?

Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.

She is our capital demand, comprised

Within the forerank of our articles.

Fair Katherine, and most fair,

Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms

Such as will enter at a lady’s ear

And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?

O fair Katherine, if you will love me

soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to

hear you confess it brokenly with your English

tongue. Do you like me, Kate?

An angel is like you, Kate, and you are

like an angel.

I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not

blush to affirm it.

What says she, fair one? That the

tongues of men are full of deceits?

The Princess is the better Englishwoman.—

I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy

understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no

better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst

find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I

had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways

to mince it in love, but directly to say “I love you.”

Then if you urge me farther than to say “Do you, in

faith?” I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i’

faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say

you, lady?

Marry, if you would put me to verses or

to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me.

For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and

for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a

reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a

lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with

my armor on my back, under the correction of

bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a

wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my

horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher

and sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God,

Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence,

nor I have no cunning in protestation, only

downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor

never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of

this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning,

that never looks in his glass for love of

anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I

speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for

this, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is

true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee

too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of

plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must

do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in

other places. For these fellows of infinite tongue,

that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favors, they

do always reason themselves out again. What? A

speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a

good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black

beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald,

a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but

a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or

rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright

and never changes but keeps his course truly. If

thou would have such a one, take me. And take me,

take a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what

say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and

fairly, I pray thee.

No, it is not possible you should love the

enemy of France, Kate. But, in loving me, you

should love the friend of France, for I love France

so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will

have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine

and I am yours, then yours is France and you are

mine.

No, Kate? I will tell thee in French,

which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a

new-married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly

to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de

France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi—let

me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!—donc

vôtre est France, et vous êtes mienne. It is as easy for

me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so

much more French. I shall never move thee in

French, unless it be to laugh at me.

No, faith, is ’t not, Kate, but thy speaking

of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely must

needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost

thou understand thus much English? Canst thou

love me?

Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I’ll

ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at

night, when you come into your closet, you’ll question

this gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate,

you will, to her, dispraise those parts in me that you

love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me

mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I

love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I

have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I

get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore

needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou

and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound

a boy, half French, half English, that shall go

to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?

Shall we not? What say’st thou, my fair flower de

luce?

No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to

promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will

endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and

for my English moiety, take the word of a king and

a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katherine

du monde, mon très cher et divin déesse?

Now fie upon my false French. By mine

honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate. By which

honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood

begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding

the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now

beshrew my father’s ambition! He was thinking of

civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created

with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that

when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in

faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.

My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of

beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou

hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt

wear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And

therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have

me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the

thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress,

take me by the hand, and say “Harry of England, I

am thine,” which word thou shalt no sooner bless

mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud “England

is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry

Plantagenet is thine,” who, though I speak it before

his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou

shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your

answer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and

thy English broken. Therefore, queen of all, Katherine,

break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt

thou have me?

Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall

please him, Kate.

Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you

my queen.

Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

Madam my interpreter, what says she?

To kiss.

It is not a fashion for the maids in France

to kiss before they are married, would she say?

O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great

kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined

within the weak list of a country’s fashion. We are

the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that

follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults,

as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of

your country in denying me a kiss. Therefore,

patiently and yielding. You have

witchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence

in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues

of the French council, and they should sooner

persuade Harry of England than a general petition

of monarchs.

Here comes your father.

I would have her learn, my fair cousin,

how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.

Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition

is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice

nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so

conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will

appear in his true likeness.

Yet they do wink and yield, as love is

blind and enforces.

Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to

consent winking.

This moral ties me over to time and a hot

summer. And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin,

in the latter end, and she must be blind too.

It is so. And you may, some of you, thank

love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair

French city for one fair French maid that stands in

my way.

Shall Kate be my wife?

I am content, so the maiden cities you

talk of may wait on her. So the maid that stood in

the way for my wish shall show me the way to my

will.

Is ’t so, my lords of England?

I pray you, then, in love and dear alliance,

Let that one article rank with the rest,

And thereupon give me your daughter.

Now welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all

That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.

Amen.

Prepare we for our marriage; on which day,

My Lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath,

And all the peers’, for surety of our leagues.

Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me,

And may our oaths well kept and prosp’rous be.
