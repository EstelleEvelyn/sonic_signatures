


I am glad you’re well.

It wears, sir, as it grows.

I know them both. Th’ other’s a jeweler.

You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication

To the great lord.

A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?

’Tis a good piece.

Indifferent.

It is a pretty mocking of the life.

Here is a touch. Is ’t good?

How this lord is followed.

Look, more.

How shall I understand you?

I saw them speak together.

’Tis conceived to scope.

This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,

With one man beckoned from the rest below,

Bowing his head against the steepy mount

To climb his happiness, would be well expressed

In our condition.

Ay, marry, what of these?

’Tis common.

A thousand moral paintings I can show

That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s

More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well

To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen

The foot above the head.

A piece of painting which I do beseech

Your Lordship to accept.

The gods preserve you.

You’re a dog.

As I took note of the place, it cannot be far

where he abides.

Certain. Alcibiades reports it. Phrynia and

Timandra had gold of him. He likewise enriched

poor straggling soldiers with great quantity. ’Tis

said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.

Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in

Athens again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore

’tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in

this supposed distress of his. It will show honestly

in us and is very likely to load our purposes with

what they travail for, if it be a just and true report

that goes of his having.

Nothing at this time but my visitation. Only I

will promise him an excellent piece.

Good as the best. Promising is the very air o’

th’ time; it opens the eyes of expectation. Performance

is ever the duller for his act, and but in the

plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying

is quite out of use. To promise is most courtly

and fashionable. Performance is a kind of will or

testament which argues a great sickness in his

judgment that makes it.

True.

When the day serves, before black-cornered night,

Find what thou want’st by free and offered light.

Come.

Our late noble master.

He and myself

Have travailed in the great shower of your gifts

And sweetly felt it.

We are hither come to offer you our service.

What we can do we’ll do to do you service.

So it is said, my noble lord, but therefor

Came not my friend nor I.

So-so, my lord.

Beseech your Honor

To make it known to us.

Most thankfully, my lord.

Doubt it not, worthy lord.

Do we, my lord?

I know none such, my lord.

Name them, my lord, let ’s know them.
