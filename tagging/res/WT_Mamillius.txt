
Ay, my good lord.

Yes, if you will, my lord.

No, my lord, I’ll fight.

I am like you, they say.

No, I’ll none of you.

You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if

I were a baby still.—I love you better.

Not for because

Your brows are blacker—yet black brows, they say,

Become some women best, so that there be not

Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,

Or a half-moon made with a pen.

I learned it out of women’s faces.—Pray now,

What color are your eyebrows?

Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose

That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

Merry or sad shall ’t be?

A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one

Of sprites and goblins.

There was a man—

Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,

Yond crickets shall not hear it.
