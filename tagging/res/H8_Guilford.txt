Salutes you all This night he dedicates

To fair content and you None here he hopes

In all this noble bevy has brought with her

One care abroad He would have all as merry

As first good company good wine good welcome

Can make good people    O my lord you're tardy

The very thought of this fair company

Clapped wings to me
