
I cannot tell

What heaven hath given himlet some graver eye

Pierce into thatbut I can see his pride

Peep through each part of him Whence has he that

If not from hell the devil is a niggard

Or has given all before and he begins

A new hell in himself

I do know

Kinsmen of mine three at the least that have

By this so sickened their estates that never

They shall abound as formerly

Is it therefore

Th' ambassador is silenced

A proper title of a peace and purchased

At a superfluous rate

As the Duke said

The will of heaven be done and the King's pleasure

By me obeyed
