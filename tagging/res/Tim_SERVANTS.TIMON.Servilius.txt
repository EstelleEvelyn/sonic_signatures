See, by good hap, yonder’s my lord.

I have sweat to see his Honor. My

honored lord.

May it please your Honor, my lord hath

sent—

Has only sent his present occasion now, my

lord, requesting your Lordship to supply his

instant use with fifty talents.

But in the meantime he wants less, my lord.

If his occasion were not virtuous,

I should not urge it half so faithfully.

Upon my soul, ’tis true, sir.

Yes, sir, I shall.

If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair

some other hour, I should derive much from ’t. For

take ’t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent.

His comfortable temper has forsook him.

He’s much out of health and keeps his chamber.

Good gods!
