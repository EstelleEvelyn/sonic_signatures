Go to you're a dry Fool I'll no more of you

Besides you grow dishonest

Sir I bade them take away you

Can you do it

Make your proof

Well sir for want of other idleness I'll bide

your proof

Good Fool for my brother's death

I know his soul is in heaven Fool

What think you of this Fool Malvolio Doth he

not mend

How say you to that Malvolio

O you are sick of self-love Malvolio and taste

with a distempered appetite To be generous guiltless

and of free disposition is to take those things

for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets There

is no slander in an allowed Fool though he do

nothing but rail nor no railing in a known discreet

man though he do nothing but reprove

From the Count Orsino is it

Who of my people hold him in delay

Fetch him off I pray you He speaks nothing

but madman Fie on him Go you

Malvolio If it be a suit from the Count I am sick

or not at home what you will to dismiss it

Now you see sir how your fooling

grows old and people dislike it

By mine honor half drunkWhat is he at the

gate cousin

A gentleman What gentleman

Cousin cousin how have you come so early by

this lethargy

Ay marry what is he

What's a drunken man like Fool

Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o'

my coz for he's in the third degree of drink he's

drowned Go look after him

Tell him he shall not speak with me

What kind o' man is he

What manner of man

Of what personage and years is he

Let him approach Call in my gentlewoman

Give me my veil Come throw it o'er my face

We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy

Speak to me I shall answer for her Your will

Whence came you sir

Are you a comedian

If I do not usurp myself I am

Come to what is important in 't I forgive you

the praise

It is the more like to be feigned I pray you

keep it in I heard you were saucy at my gates and

allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than

to hear you If you be not mad begone if you have

reason be brief 'Tis not that time of moon with me

to make one in so skipping a dialogue

Tell me your mind

Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver

when the courtesy of it is so fearful Speak your

office

Yet you began rudely What are you What

would you

Give us the place alone We will hear this

divinity Now sir what

is your text

A comfortable doctrine and much may be said

of it Where lies your text

In his bosom In what chapter of his bosom

O I have read it it is heresy Have you no more

to say

Have you any commission from your lord to

negotiate with my face You are now out of your

text But we will draw the curtain and show you the

picture Look you sir such a

one I was this present Is 't not well done

'Tis in grain sir 'twill endure wind and

weather

O sir I will not be so hard-hearted I will give

out divers schedules of my beauty It shall be

inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled

to my will as item two lips indifferent red item

two gray eyes with lids to them item one neck one

chin and so forth Were you sent hither to praise

me

How does he love me

Your lord does know my mind I cannot love him

Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble

Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth

In voices well divulged free learned and valiant

And in dimension and the shape of nature

A gracious person But yet I cannot love him

He might have took his answer long ago

Why what would you

You might do much

What is your parentage

Get you to your lord

I cannot love him Let him send no more

Unless perchance you come to me again

To tell me how he takes it Fare you well

I thank you for your pains Spend this for me

What is your parentage

Above my fortunes yet my state is well

I am a gentleman I'll be sworn thou art

Thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit

Do give thee fivefold blazon Not too fast Soft soft

Unless the master were the man How now

Even so quickly may one catch the plague

Methinks I feel this youth's perfections

With an invisible and subtle stealth

To creep in at mine eyes Well let it be

What ho Malvolio

Run after that same peevish messenger

The County's man He left this ring behind him

Would I or not Tell him I'll none of it

Desire him not to flatter with his lord

Nor hold him up with hopes I am not for him

If that the youth will come this way tomorrow

I'll give him reasons for 't Hie thee Malvolio

I do I know not what and fear to find

Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind

Fate show thy force Ourselves we do not owe

What is decreed must be and be this so

Let the garden door be shut and leave me to

my hearing

Give me your hand sir

What is your name

My servant sir 'Twas never merry world

Since lowly feigning was called compliment

You're servant to the Count Orsino youth

For him I think not on him For his thoughts

Would they were blanks rather than filled with me

O by your leave I pray you

I bade you never speak again of him

But would you undertake another suit

I had rather hear you to solicit that

Than music from the spheres

Give me leave beseech you I did send

After the last enchantment you did here

A ring in chase of you So did I abuse

Myself my servant and I fear me you

Under your hard construction must I sit

To force that on you in a shameful cunning

Which you knew none of yours What might you think

Have you not set mine honor at the stake

And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts

That tyrannous heart can think To one of your receiving

Enough is shown A cypress not a bosom

Hides my heart So let me hear you speak

That's a degree to love

Why then methinks 'tis time to smile again

O world how apt the poor are to be proud

If one should be a prey how much the better

To fall before the lion than the wolf

The clock upbraids me with the waste of time

Be not afraid good youth I will not have you

And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest

Your wife is like to reap a proper man

There lies your way due west

Stay I prithee tell me what thou think'st of me

If I think so I think the same of you

I would you were as I would have you be

O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful

In the contempt and anger of his lip

A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon

Than love that would seem hid Love's night is noon

Cesario by the roses of the spring

By maidhood honor truth and everything

I love thee so that maugre all thy pride

Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide

Do not extort thy reasons from this clause

For that I woo thou therefore hast no cause

But rather reason thus with reason fetter

Love sought is good but given unsought is better

Yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move

That heart which now abhors to like his love

I have sent after him He says he'll come

How shall I feast him What bestow of him

For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrowed

I speak too loud

Where's Malvolio He is sad and civil

And suits well for a servant with my fortunes

Where is Malvolio

Why what's the matter Does he rave

Go call him hither I am as mad as he

If sad and merry madness equal be

How now Malvolio

Smil'st thou I sent for thee upon a sad

occasion

Why how dost thou man What is the matter

with thee

Wilt thou go to bed Malvolio

God comfort thee Why dost thou smile so and

kiss thy hand so oft

What mean'st thou by that Malvolio

Ha

What sayst thou

Heaven restore thee

Thy yellow stockings

Cross-gartered

Am I made

Why this is very midsummer madness

I'll come to him Good Maria let

this fellow be looked to Where's my Cousin Toby

Let some of my people have a special care of him I

would not have him miscarry for the half of my

dowry

I have said too much unto a heart of stone

And laid mine honor too unchary on 't

There's something in me that reproves my fault

But such a headstrong potent fault it is

That it but mocks reproof

Here wear this jewel for me 'Tis my picture

Refuse it not It hath no tongue to vex you

And I beseech you come again tomorrow

What shall you ask of me that I'll deny

That honor saved may upon asking give

How with mine honor may I give him that

Which I have given to you

Well come again tomorrow Fare thee well

A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell

Hold Toby On thy life I charge thee hold

Will it be ever thus Ungracious wretch

Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves

Where manners ne'er were preached Out of my sight

Be not offended dear Cesario

Rudesby begone I prithee gentle friend

Let thy fair wisdom not thy passion sway

In this uncivil and unjust extent

Against thy peace Go with me to my house

And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks

This ruffian hath botched up that thou thereby

Mayst smile at this Thou shalt not choose but go

Do not deny Beshrew his soul for me

He started one poor heart of mine in thee

Nay come I prithee Would thou 'dst be ruled by me

O say so and so be

Blame not this haste of mine If you mean well

Now go with me and with this holy man

Into the chantry by There before him

And underneath that consecrated roof

Plight me the full assurance of your faith

That my most jealous and too doubtful soul

May live at peace He shall conceal it

Whiles you are willing it shall come to note

What time we will our celebration keep

According to my birth What do you say

Then lead the way good father and heavens so shine

That they may fairly note this act of mine

What would my lord but that he may not have

Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable

Cesario you do not keep promise with me

What do you say CesarioGood my lord

If it be aught to the old tune my lord

It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear

As howling after music

Still so constant lord

Even what it please my lord that shall become him

Where goes Cesario

Ay me detested How am I beguiled

Hast thou forgot thyself Is it so long

Call forth the holy father

Whither my lordCesario husband stay

Ay husband Can he that deny

Alas it is the baseness of thy fear

That makes thee strangle thy propriety

Fear not Cesario Take thy fortunes up

Be that thou know'st thou art and then thou art

As great as that thou fear'st    O welcome father

Father I charge thee by thy reverence

Here to unfold though lately we intended

To keep in darkness what occasion now

Reveals before 'tis ripe what thou dost know

Hath newly passed between this youth and me

O do not swear

Hold little faith though thou hast too much fear

What's the matter

Who has done this Sir Andrew

Away with him Who hath made this havoc

with them

Get him to bed and let his hurt be looked to

Most wonderful

He shall enlarge him    Fetch Malvolio hither

And yet alas now I remember me

They say poor gentleman he's much distract

A most extracting frenzy of mine own

From my remembrance clearly banished his

How does he sirrah

Open 't and read it

How now art thou mad

Prithee read i' thy right wits

Read it you sirrah

Did he write this

See him delivered Fabian Bring him hither

My lord so please you these things further thought on

To think me as well a sister as a wife

One day shall crown th' alliance on 't so please you

Here at my house and at my proper cost

A sister You are she

Ay my lord this same

How now Malvolio

Have I Malvolio No

Alas Malvolio this is not my writing

Though I confess much like the character

But out of question 'tis Maria's hand

And now I do bethink me it was she

First told me thou wast mad then cam'st in smiling

And in such forms which here were presupposed

Upon thee in the letter Prithee be content

This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee

But when we know the grounds and authors of it

Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge

Of thine own cause

Alas poor fool how have they baffled thee

He hath been most notoriously abused
