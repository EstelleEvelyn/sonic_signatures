


Long live Queen Margaret England's happiness

Imprimis it is agreed between the

French king Charles and William de la Pole Marquess

of Suffolk ambassador for Henry King of England

that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady

Margaret daughter unto Reignier King of Naples

Sicilia and Jerusalem and crown her Queen of England

ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing Item

that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine

shall be released and delivered to the King her

father

Pardon me gracious lord

Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart

And dimmed mine eyes that I can read no further

Brave peers of England pillars of the state

To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief

Your grief the common grief of all the land

What did my brother Henry spend his youth

His valor coin and people in the wars

Did he so often lodge in open field

In winter's cold and summer's parching heat

To conquer France his true inheritance

And did my brother Bedford toil his wits

To keep by policy what Henry got

Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham

Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick

Received deep scars in France and Normandy

Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself

With all the learnd council of the realm

Studied so long sat in the Council House

Early and late debating to and fro

How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe

And had his Highness in his infancy

Crowned in Paris in despite of foes

And shall these labors and these honors die

Shall Henry's conquest Bedford's vigilance

Your deeds of war and all our counsel die

O peers of England shameful is this league

Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame

Blotting your names from books of memory

Razing the characters of your renown

Defacing monuments of conquered France

Undoing all as all had never been

Ay uncle we will keep it if we can

But now it is impossible we should

Suffolk the new-made duke that rules the roast

Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine

Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style

Agrees not with the leanness of his purse

A proper jest and never heard before

That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth

For costs and charges in transporting her

She should have stayed in France and starved in France

Before

My lord of Winchester I know your mind

'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike

But 'tis my presence that doth trouble you

Rancor will out Proud prelate in thy face

I see thy fury If I longer stay

We shall begin our ancient bickerings

Lordings farewell and say when I am gone

I prophesied France will be lost ere long

O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord

Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts

And may that hour when I imagine ill

Against my king and nephew virtuous Henry

Be my last breathing in this mortal world

My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad

Methought this staff mine office badge in court

Was broke in twainby whom I have forgot

But as I think it was by th' Cardinal

And on the pieces of the broken wand

Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset

And William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk

This was my dream What it doth bode God knows

Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright

Presumptuous dame ill-nurtured Eleanor

Art thou not second woman in the realm

And the Protector's wife beloved of him

Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command

Above the reach or compass of thy thought

And wilt thou still be hammering treachery

To tumble down thy husband and thyself

From top of honor to disgrace's feet

Away from me and let me hear no more

Nay be not angry I am pleased again

I goCome Nell thou wilt ride with us

Madam the King is old enough himself

To give his censure These are no women's matters

Madam I am Protector of the realm

And at his pleasure will resign my place

Now lords my choler being overblown

With walking once about the quadrangle

I come to talk of commonwealth affairs

As for your spiteful false objections

Prove them and I lie open to the law

But God in mercy so deal with my soul

As I in duty love my king and country

But to the matter that we have in hand

I say my sovereign York is meetest man

To be your regent in the realm of France

This doom my lord if I may judge

Let Somerset be regent o'er the French

Because in York this breeds suspicion

And let these have a day appointed them

For single combat in convenient place

For he hath witness of his servant's malice

This is the law and this Duke Humphrey's doom

Sirrah or you must fight or else be hanged

My lord 'tis but a base ignoble mind

That mounts no higher than a bird can soar

Ay my Lord Cardinal how think you by that

Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven

What cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory

Tantaene animis caelestibus irae

Churchmen so hot Good uncle hide such malice

With such holiness can you do it

As who my lord

Why Suffolk England knows thine insolence

Faith holy uncle would 't were come to that

Make up no factious numbers for the matter

In thine own person answer thy abuse

True uncle Are you advised The east side of the grove

Talking of hawking nothing else my lord

Now by God's mother priest I'll shave your crown for this

Or all my fence shall fail

What means this noise

Fellow what miracle dost thou proclaim

Stand by my mastersBring him near the King

His Highness' pleasure is to talk with him

Hadst thou been his mother thou couldst

have better told

How long hast thou been blind

What and wouldst climb a tree

Mass thou lov'dst plums well that

wouldst venture so

A subtle knave but yet it shall not serve

Let me see thine eyes Wink now Now open them

In my opinion yet thou seest not well

Sayst thou me so What color is this cloak of

Why that's well said What color is my gown of

But cloaks and gowns before this day a many

Tell me sirrah what's my name

What's his name

Nor his

What's thine own name

Then Sander sit there the lying'st knave

in Christendom If thou hadst been born blind

thou mightst as well have known all our names as

thus to name the several colors we do wear Sight

may distinguish of colors but suddenly to nominate

them all it is impossibleMy lords Saint

Alban here hath done a miracle and would you

not think his cunning to be great that could

restore this cripple to his legs again

My masters of Saint Albans have you not

beadles in your town and things called whips

Then send for one presently

Now fetch me a stool hither by and by

Now sirrah if you mean to

save yourself from whipping leap me over this

stool and run away

Well sir we must have you find your

legsSirrah beadle whip him till he leap over

that same stool

Follow the knave and take this drab away

Let them be whipped through every market town

Till they come to Berwick from whence they came

But you have done more miracles than I

You made in a day my lord whole towns to fly

Ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart

Sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers

And vanquished as I am I yield to thee

Or to the meanest groom

Madam for myself to heaven I do appeal

How I have loved my king and commonweal

And for my wife I know not how it stands

Sorry I am to hear what I have heard

Noble she is but if she have forgot

Honor and virtue and conversed with such

As like to pitch defile nobility

I banish her my bed and company

And give her as a prey to law and shame

That hath dishonored Gloucester's honest name

Eleanor the law thou seest hath judged thee

I cannot justify whom the law condemns

Mine eyes are full of tears my heart of grief

Ah Humphrey this dishonor in thine age

Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground

I beseech your Majesty give me leave to go

Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease

My staffHere noble Henry is my staff

As willingly do I the same resign

As e'er thy father Henry made it mine

And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it

As others would ambitiously receive it

Farewell good king When I am dead and gone

May honorable peace attend thy throne

Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud

And after summer evermore succeeds

Barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold

So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet

Sirs what's o'clock

Ten is the hour that was appointed me

To watch the coming of my punished duchess

Uneath may she endure the flinty streets

To tread them with her tender-feeling feet

Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook

The abject people gazing on thy face

With envious looks laughing at thy shame

That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels

When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets

But soft I think she comes and I'll prepare

My tearstained eyes to see her miseries

No stir not for your lives Let her pass by

Be patient gentle Nell Forget this grief

Ah Nell forbear Thou aimest all awry

I must offend before I be attainted

And had I twenty times so many foes

And each of them had twenty times their power

All these could not procure me any scathe

So long as I am loyal true and crimeless

Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach

Why yet thy scandal were not wiped away

But I in danger for the breach of law

Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell

I pray thee sort thy heart to patience

These few days' wonder will be quickly worn

And my consent ne'er asked herein before

This is close dealing Well I will be there

My Nell I take my leaveAnd master sheriff

Let not her penance exceed the King's commission

Must you Sir John protect my lady here

Entreat her not the worse in that I pray

You use her well The world may laugh again

And I may live to do you kindness if

You do it her And so Sir John farewell

Witness my tears I cannot stay to speak

All happiness unto my lord the King

Pardon my liege that I have stayed so long

Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush

Nor change my countenance for this arrest

A heart unspotted is not easily daunted

The purest spring is not so free from mud

As I am clear from treason to my sovereign

Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty

Is it but thought so What are they that think it

I never robbed the soldiers of their pay

Nor ever had one penny bribe from France

So help me God as I have watched the night

Ay night by nightin studying good for England

That doit that e'er I wrested from the King

Or any groat I hoarded to my use

Be brought against me at my trial day

No many a pound of mine own proper store

Because I would not tax the needy Commons

Have I dispursd to the garrisons

And never asked for restitution

I say no more than truth so help me God

Why 'tis well known that whiles I was Protector

Pity was all the fault that was in me

For I should melt at an offender's tears

And lowly words were ransom for their fault

Unless it were a bloody murderer

Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers

I never gave them condign punishment

Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortured

Above the felon or what trespass else

Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous

Virtue is choked with foul ambition

And charity chased hence by rancor's hand

Foul subornation is predominant

And equity exiled your Highness' land

I know their complot is to have my life

And if my death might make this island happy

And prove the period of their tyranny

I would expend it with all willingness

But mine is made the prologue to their play

For thousands more that yet suspect no peril

Will not conclude their plotted tragedy

Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice

And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate

Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue

The envious load that lies upon his heart

And dogged York that reaches at the moon

Whose overweening arm I have plucked back

By false accuse doth level at my life

And you my sovereign lady with the rest

Causeless have laid disgraces on my head

And with your best endeavor have stirred up

My liefest liege to be mine enemy

Ay all of you have laid your heads together

Myself had notice of your conventicles

And all to make away my guiltless life

I shall not want false witness to condemn me

Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt

The ancient proverb will be well effected

A staff is quickly found to beat a dog

Far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed

Beshrew the winners for they played me false

And well such losers may have leave to speak

Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch

Before his legs be firm to bear his body

Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side

And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first

Ah that my fear were false ah that it were

For good King Henry thy decay I fear
