


The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel

Patience is for poltroons such as he

He durst not sit there had your father lived

My gracious lord here in the Parliament

Let us assail the family of York

Whom should he follow but his natural king

Urge it no more lest that instead of words

I send thee Warwick such a messenger

As shall revenge his death before I stir

King Henry be thy title right or wrong

Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defense

May that ground gape and swallow me alive

Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father

What wrong is this unto the Prince your son

How hast thou injured both thyself and us

Come cousin let us tell the Queen these news

In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome

Or live in peace abandoned and despised

Chaplain away Thy priesthood saves thy life

As for the brat of this accursd duke

Whose father slew my father he shall die

Soldiers away with him

How now Is he dead already Or is it fear

That makes him close his eyes I'll open them

In vain thou speak'st poor boy My father's blood

Hath stopped the passage where thy words should enter

Had I thy brethren here their lives and thine

Were not revenge sufficient for me

No if I digged up thy forefathers' graves

And hung their rotten coffins up in chains

It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart

The sight of any of the house of York

Is as a fury to torment my soul

And till I root out their accursd line

And leave not one alive I live in hell

Therefore

Such pity as my rapier's point affords

Thy father hath

No cause Thy father slew my father therefore die

Plantagenet I come Plantagenet

And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade

Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood

Congealed with this do make me wipe off both

Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm

With downright payment showed unto my father

Now Phaton hath tumbled from his car

And made an evening at the noontide prick

So cowards fight when they can fly no further

So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons

So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives

Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers

I will not bandy with thee word for word

But buckler with thee blows twice two for one

Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin

That is my office for my father's sake

Here's for my oath here's for my father's death

My gracious liege this too much lenity

And harmful pity must be laid aside

To whom do lions cast their gentle looks

Not to the beast that would usurp their den

Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick

Not his that spoils her young before her face

Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting

Not he that sets his foot upon her back

The smallest worm will turn being trodden on

And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood

Ambitious York did level at thy crown

Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows

He but a duke would have his son a king

And raise his issue like a loving sire

Thou being a king blest with a goodly son

Didst yield consent to disinherit him

Which argued thee a most unloving father

Unreasonable creatures feed their young

And though man's face be fearful to their eyes

Yet in protection of their tender ones

Who hath not seen them even with those wings

Which sometime they have used with fearful flight

Make war with him that climbed unto their nest

Offering their own lives in their young's defense

For shame my liege make them your precedent

Were it not pity that this goodly boy

Should lose his birthright by his father's fault

And long hereafter say unto his child

What my great-grandfather and grandsire got

My careless father fondly gave away

Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy

And let his manly face which promiseth

Successful fortune steel thy melting heart

To hold thine own and leave thine own with him

Why that is spoken like a toward prince

I would your Highness would depart the field

The Queen hath best success when you are absent

And reason too

Who should succeed the father but the son

Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee

Or any he the proudest of thy sort

Ay and old York and yet not satisfied

You said so much before and yet you fled

I slew thy father call'st thou him a child

My liege the wound that bred this meeting here

Cannot be cured by words therefore be still

Now Richard I am with thee here alone

This is the hand that stabbed thy father York

And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland

And here's the heart that triumphs in their death

And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother

To execute the like upon thyself

And so have at thee

Here burns my candle out ay here it dies

Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light

O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow

More than my body's parting with my soul

My love and fear glued many friends to thee

And now I fall thy tough commixtures melts

Impairing Henry strength'ning misproud York

And whither fly the gnats but to the sun

And who shines now but Henry's enemies

O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent

That Phaton should check thy fiery steeds

Thy burning car never had scorched the Earth

And Henry hadst thou swayed as kings should do

Or as thy father and his father did

Giving no ground unto the house of York

They never then had sprung like summer flies

I and ten thousand in this luckless realm

Had left no mourning widows for our death

And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace

For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air

And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity

Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds

No way to fly no strength to hold out flight

The foe is merciless and will not pity

For at their hands I have deserved no pity

The air hath got into my deadly wounds

And much effuse of blood doth make me faint

Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest

I stabbed your fathers' bosoms split my breast
