


Thou princely leader of our English strength

Never so needful on the earth of France

Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot

Who now is girdled with a waist of iron

And hemmed about with grim destruction

To Bordeaux warlike duke To Bordeaux York

Else farewell Talbot France and England's honor

O send some succor to the distressed lord

Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul

And on his son young John who two hours since

I met in travel toward his warlike father

This seven years did not Talbot see his son

And now they meet where both their lives are done

Thus while the vulture of sedition

Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders

Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss

The conquest of our scarce-cold conqueror

That ever-living man of memory

Henry the Fifth Whiles they each other cross

Lives honors lands and all hurry to loss

Whither my lord From bought and sold Lord Talbot

Who ringed about with bold adversity

Cries out for noble York and Somerset

To beat assailing Death from his weak regions

And whiles the honorable captain there

Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs

And in advantage ling'ring looks for rescue

You his false hopes the trust of England's honor

Keep off aloof with worthless emulation

Let not your private discord keep away

The levied succors that should lend him aid

While he renownd noble gentleman

Yield up his life unto a world of odds

Orleance the Bastard Charles Burgundy

Alanson Reignier compass him about

And Talbot perisheth by your default

And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims

Swearing that you withhold his levied host

Collected for this expedition

The fraud of England not the force of France

Hath now entrapped the noble-minded Talbot

Never to England shall he bear his life

But dies betrayed to fortune by your strife

Too late comes rescue he is ta'en or slain

For fly he could not if he would have fled

And fly would Talbot never though he might

His fame lives in the world his shame in you

Herald conduct me to the Dauphin's tent

To know who hath obtained the glory of the day

Submission dauphin 'Tis a mere French word

We English warriors wot not what it means

I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en

And to survey the bodies of the dead

But where's the great Alcides of the field

Valiant Lord Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury

Created for his rare success in arms

Great Earl of Washford Waterford and Valence

Lord Talbot of Goodrich and Urchinfield

Lord Strange of Blackmere Lord Verdon of Alton

Lord Cromwell of Wingfield Lord Furnival of Sheffield

The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge

Knight of the noble Order of Saint George

Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece

Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth

Of all his wars within the realm of France

Is Talbot slain the Frenchmen's only scourge

Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis

O were mine eyeballs into bullets turned

That I in rage might shoot them at your faces

O that I could but call these dead to life

It were enough to fright the realm of France

Were but his picture left amongst you here

It would amaze the proudest of you all

Give me their bodies that I may bear them hence

And give them burial as beseems their worth

I'll bear them hence

But from their ashes shall be reared

A phoenix that shall make all France afeard
