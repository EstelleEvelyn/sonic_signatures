What is Thisbe—a wand’ring knight?

Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a

beard coming.

That would hang us, every mother’s son.

Must I speak now?

Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,

Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier,

Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,

As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.

I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.

O!

As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.

If he come not, then the play is marred. It goes

not forward, doth it?

No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftman

in Athens.

You must say “paragon.” A “paramour” is (God

bless us) a thing of naught.

O, sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence

a day during his life. He could not have

’scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given

him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be

hanged. He would have deserved it. Sixpence a day

in Pyramus, or nothing!

O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans

For parting my fair Pyramus and me.

My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,

Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

 My love! Thou art my love, I think.

And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.

As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.

I kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.

’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay.

This is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?

Asleep, my love?

What, dead, my dove?

O Pyramus, arise!

Speak, speak. Quite dumb?

Dead? Dead? A tomb

Must cover thy sweet eyes.

These lily lips,

This cherry nose,

These yellow cowslip cheeks

Are gone, are gone!

Lovers, make moan;

His eyes were green as leeks.

O Sisters Three,

Come, come to me

With hands as pale as milk.

Lay them in gore,

Since you have shore

With shears his thread of silk.

Tongue, not a word!

Come, trusty sword,

Come, blade, my breast imbrue!

And farewell, friends.

Thus Thisbe ends.

Adieu, adieu, adieu.
