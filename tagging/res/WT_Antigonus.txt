


Be certain what you do sir lest your justice

Prove violence in the which three great ones suffer

Yourself your queen your son

If it prove

She's otherwise I'll keep my stables where

I lodge my wife I'll go in couples with her

Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her

For every inch of woman in the world

Ay every dram of woman's flesh is false

If she be

It is for you we speak not for ourselves

You are abused and by some putter-on

That will be damned for 't Would I knew the villain

I would land-damn him Be she honor-flawed

I have three daughtersthe eldest is eleven

The second and the third nine and some five

If this prove true they'll pay for 't By mine honor

I'll geld 'em all fourteen they shall not see

To bring false generations They are co-heirs

And I had rather glib myself than they

Should not produce fair issue

If it be so

We need no grave to bury honesty

There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten

Of the whole dungy Earth

And I wish my liege

You had only in your silent judgment tried it

Without more overture

To laughter as I take it

If the good truth were known

That's enough

I told her so my lord

On your displeasure's peril and on mine

She should not visit you

La you now you hear

When she will take the rein I let her run

But she'll not stumble

I am none by this good light

Hang all the husbands

That cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself

Hardly one subject

I did not sir

These lords my noble fellows if they please

Can clear me in 't

Anything my lord

That my ability may undergo

And nobleness impose At least thus much

I'll pawn the little blood which I have left

To save the innocent Anything possible

I will my lord

I swear to do this though a present death

Had been more mercifulCome on poor babe

Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens

To be thy nurses Wolves and bears they say

Casting their savageness aside have done

Like offices of pity Sir be prosperous

In more than this deed does requireAnd blessing

Against this cruelty fight on thy side

Poor thing condemned to loss

Thou art perfect then our ship hath touched upon

The deserts of Bohemia

Their sacred wills be done Go get aboard

Look to thy bark I'll not be long before

I call upon thee

Go thou away

I'll follow instantly

Come poor babe

I have heard but not believed the spirits o' th' dead

May walk again If such thing be thy mother

Appeared to me last night for ne'er was dream

So like a waking To me comes a creature

Sometimes her head on one side some another

I never saw a vessel of like sorrow

So filled and so becoming In pure white robes

Like very sanctity she did approach

My cabin where I lay thrice bowed before me

And gasping to begin some speech her eyes

Became two spouts The fury spent anon

Did this break from her Good Antigonus

Since fate against thy better disposition

Hath made thy person for the thrower-out

Of my poor babe according to thine oath

Places remote enough are in Bohemia

There weep and leave it crying And for the babe

Is counted lost forever Perdita

I prithee call 't For this ungentle business

Put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see

Thy wife Paulina more And so with shrieks

She melted into air Affrighted much

I did in time collect myself and thought

This was so and no slumber Dreams are toys

Yet for this once yea superstitiously

I will be squared by this I do believe

Hermione hath suffered death and that

Apollo would this being indeed the issue

Of King Polixenes it should here be laid

Either for life or death upon the earth

Of its right fatherBlossom speed thee well

There lie and there thy character there these

Which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty

And still rest thine The storm begins Poor wretch

That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed

To loss and what may follow Weep I cannot

But my heart bleeds and most accurst am I

To be by oath enjoined to this Farewell

The day frowns more and more Thou 'rt like to have

A lullaby too rough I never saw

The heavens so dim by day  A savage clamor

Well may I get aboard This is the chase

I am gone forever
