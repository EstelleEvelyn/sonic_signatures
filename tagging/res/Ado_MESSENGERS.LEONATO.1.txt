


He is very near by this He was not three

leagues off when I left him

But few of any sort and none of name

Much deserved on his part and equally

remembered by Don Pedro He hath borne himself

beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure

of a lamb the feats of a lion He hath indeed better

bettered expectation than you must expect of me to

tell you how

I have already delivered him letters and

there appears much joy in him even so much that

joy could not show itself modest enough without a

badge of bitterness

In great measure

I know none of that name lady There

was none such in the army of any sort

O he's returned and as pleasant as ever

he was

He hath done good service lady in these

wars

And a good soldier too lady

A lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed

with all honorable virtues

Is 't possible

I see lady the gentleman is not in your

books

He is most in the company of the right

noble Claudio

I will hold friends with you lady

Don Pedro is approached

My lord they stay for you to give your

daughter to her husband
