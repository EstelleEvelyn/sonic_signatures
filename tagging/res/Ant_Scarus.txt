
Gods and goddesses

All the whole synod of them

The greater cantle of the world is lost

With very ignorance We have kissed away

Kingdoms and provinces

On our side like the tokened pestilence

Where death is sure Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt

Whom leprosy o'ertake i' th' midst o' th' fight

When vantage like a pair of twins appeared

Both as the sameor rather ours the elder

The breeze upon her like a cow in June

Hoists sails and flies

She once being loofed

The noble ruin of her magic Antony

Claps on his sea-wing and like a doting mallard

Leaving the fight in height flies after her

I never saw an action of such shame

Experience manhood honor ne'er before

Did violate so itself

'Tis easy to 't and there I will attend

What further comes

O my brave emperor this is fought indeed

Had we done so at first we had droven them home

With clouts about their heads

I had a wound here that was like a T

But now 'tis made an H

We'll beat 'em into bench-holes I have yet

Room for six scotches more

Let us score their backs

And snatch 'em up as we take hares behind

'Tis sport to maul a runner

I'll halt after

For both my lord

Swallows have built

In Cleopatra's sails their nests The augurs

Say they know not they cannot tell look grimly

And dare not speak their knowledge Antony

Is valiant and dejected and by starts

His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear

Of what he has and has not
