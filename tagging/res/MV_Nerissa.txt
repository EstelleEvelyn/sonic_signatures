


You would be sweet madam if your miseries

were in the same abundance as your good fortunes

are And yet for aught I see they are as sick that

surfeit with too much as they that starve with

nothing It is no mean happiness therefore to be

seated in the mean Superfluity comes sooner by

white hairs but competency lives longer

They would be better if well followed

Your father was ever virtuous and holy men

at their death have good inspirations Therefore the

lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of

gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his

meaning chooses you will no doubt never be

chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly

love But what warmth is there in your affection

towards any of these princely suitors that are already

come

First there is the Neapolitan prince

Then is there the County Palatine

How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le

Bon

What say you then to Falconbridge the young

baron of England

What think you of the Scottish lord his

neighbor

How like you the young German the Duke of

Saxony's nephew

If he should offer to choose and choose the

right casket you should refuse to perform your

father's will if you should refuse to accept him

You need not fear lady the having any of

these lords They have acquainted me with their

determinations which is indeed to return to their

home and to trouble you with no more suit unless

you may be won by some other sort than your

father's imposition depending on the caskets

Do you not remember lady in your father's

time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came

hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat

True madam He of all the men that ever my

foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a

fair lady

Quick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straight

The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath

And comes to his election presently

The ancient saying is no heresy

Hanging and wiving goes by destiny

Bassanio Lord Love if thy will it be

My lord and lady it is now our time

That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper

To cry Good joy good joy my lord and lady

Madam it is so you stand pleased withal

What and stake down

Shall they see us

Why shall we turn to men

From both my lord Bellario greets your Grace

He attendeth here hard by

To know your answer whether you'll admit him

'Tis well you offer it behind her back

The wish would make else an unquiet house

Sir I would speak with you

I'll see if I can get my husband's ring

Which I did make him swear to keep forever

Come good sir will you show me to this house

When the moon shone we did not see the candle

It is your music madam of the house

Silence bestows that virtue on it madam

What talk you of the posy or the value

You swore to me when I did give it you

That you would wear it till your hour of death

And that it should lie with you in your grave

Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths

You should have been respective and have kept it

Gave it a judge's clerk No God's my judge

The clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it

Ay if a woman live to be a man

Nor I in yours

Till I again see mine

And I his clerk Therefore be well advised

How you do leave me to mine own protection

And pardon me my gentle Gratiano

For that same scrubbd boy the doctor's clerk

In lieu of this last night did lie with me

Ay but the clerk that never means to do it

Unless he live until he be a man

Ay and I'll give them him without a fee

There do I give to you and Jessica

From the rich Jew a special deed of gift

After his death of all he dies possessed of
