


Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells

King John your king and England's doth approach

Commander of this hot malicious day

Their armors that marched hence so silver bright

Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood

There stuck no plume in any English crest

That is removd by a staff of France

Our colors do return in those same hands

That did display them when we first marched forth

And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come

Our lusty English all with purpled hands

Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes

Open your gates and give the victors way
