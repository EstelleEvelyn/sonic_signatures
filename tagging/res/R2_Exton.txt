


Didst thou not mark the King what words he spake

Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear

Was it not so

Have I no friend quoth he He spake it twice

And urged it twice together did he not

And speaking it he wishtly looked on me

As who should say I would thou wert the man

That would divorce this terror from my heart

Meaning the king at Pomfret Come let's go

I am the King's friend and will rid his foe

As full of valor as of royal blood

Both have I spilled O would the deed were good

For now the devil that told me I did well

Says that this deed is chronicled in hell

This dead king to the living king I'll bear

Take hence the rest and give them burial here

Great king within this coffin I present

Thy buried fear Herein all breathless lies

The mightiest of thy greatest enemies

Richard of Bourdeaux by me hither brought

From your own mouth my lord did I this deed
