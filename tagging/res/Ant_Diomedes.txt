Where's Antony

Lives he Wilt thou not answer man

Most absolute lord

My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee

Now my lord

Locked in her monument She had a prophesying fear

Of what hath come to pass For when she saw

Which never shall be foundyou did suspect

She had disposed with Caesar and that your rage

Would not be purged she sent you word she was dead

But fearing since how it might work hath sent

Me to proclaim the truth and I am come

I dread too late

What ho The Emperor's guard The guard what ho

Come your lord calls

His death's upon him but not dead

Look out o' th' other side your monument

His guard have brought him thither

A heavy sight
