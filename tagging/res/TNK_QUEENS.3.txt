


Now for the love of him whom Jove hath marked

The honor of your bed and for the sake

Of clear virginity be advocate

For us and our distresses This good deed

Shall raze you out o' th' book of trespasses

All you are set down there

O my petition was

Set down in ice which by hot grief uncandied

Melts into drops so sorrow wanting form

Is pressed with deeper matter

O woe

You cannot read it there There through my tears

Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream

You may behold 'em Lady lady alack

He that will all the treasure know o' th' Earth

Must know the center too he that will fish

For my least minnow let him lead his line

To catch one at my heart O pardon me

Extremity that sharpens sundry wits

Makes me a fool

None fit for th' dead

Those that with cords knives drams precipitance

Weary of this world's light have to themselves

Been death's most horrid agents human grace

Affords them dust and shadow

And his army full

Of bread and sloth

Farewell

O help now

Our cause cries for your knee

If not above him for

Thou being but mortal makest affections bend

To godlike honors they themselves some say

Groan under such a mast'ry

All the good that may

Be wished upon thy head I cry Amen to 't

Urns and odors bring away

Vapors sighs darken the day

Our dole more deadly looks than dying

Balms and gums and heavy cheers

Sacred vials filled with tears

And clamors through the wild air flying

Come all sad and solemn shows

That are quick-eyed Pleasure's foes

We convent naught else but woes

We convent naught else but woes

This funeral path brings to your household's grave

Joy seize on you again peace sleep with him

This world's a city full of straying streets

And death's the market-place where each one meets
