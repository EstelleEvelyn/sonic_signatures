


Thus have you heard our cause and known our means

And my most noble friends I pray you all

Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes

And first Lord Marshal what say you to it

'Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed

It was young Hotspur's cause at Shrewsbury

That he should draw his several strengths together

And come against us in full puissance

Need not to be dreaded

Let us on

And publish the occasion of our arms

The commonwealth is sick of their own choice

Their over-greedy love hath surfeited

An habitation giddy and unsure

Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart

O thou fond many with what loud applause

Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke

Before he was what thou wouldst have him be

And being now trimmed in thine own desires

Thou beastly feeder art so full of him

That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up

So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge

Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard

And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up

And howl'st to find it What trust is in these times

They that when Richard lived would have him die

Are now become enamored on his grave

Thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head

When through proud London he came sighing on

After th' admird heels of Bolingbroke

Criest now O earth yield us that king again

And take thou this O thoughts of men accursed

Past and to come seems best things present worst

What is this forest called

Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth

To know the numbers of our enemies

'Tis well done

My friends and brethren in these great affairs

I must acquaint you that I have received

New-dated letters from Northumberland

Their cold intent tenor and substance thus

Here doth he wish his person with such powers

As might hold sortance with his quality

The which he could not levy whereupon

He is retired to ripe his growing fortunes

To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers

That your attempts may overlive the hazard

And fearful meeting of their opposite

What well-appointed leader fronts us here

Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace

What doth concern your coming

Wherefore do I this So the question stands

Briefly to this end we are all diseased

And with our surfeiting and wanton hours

Have brought ourselves into a burning fever

And we must bleed for it of which disease

Our late King Richard being infected died

But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland

I take not on me here as a physician

Nor do I as an enemy to peace

Troop in the throngs of military men

But rather show awhile like fearful war

To diet rank minds sick of happiness

And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop

Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly

I have in equal balance justly weighed

What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer

And find our griefs heavier than our offenses

We see which way the stream of time doth run

And are enforced from our most quiet there

By the rough torrent of occasion

And have the summary of all our griefs

When time shall serve to show in articles

Which long ere this we offered to the King

And might by no suit gain our audience

When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs

We are denied access unto his person

Even by those men that most have done us wrong

The dangers of the days but newly gone

Whose memory is written on the earth

With yet-appearing blood and the examples

Of every minute's instance present now

Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms

Not to break peace or any branch of it

But to establish here a peace indeed

Concurring both in name and quality

My brother general the commonwealth

To brother born an household cruelty

I make my quarrel in particular

Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule

For this contains our general grievances

Each several article herein redressed

All members of our cause both here and hence

That are insinewed to this action

Acquitted by a true substantial form

And present execution of our wills

To us and to our purposes confined

We come within our awful banks again

And knit our powers to the arm of peace

My lord we will do so

No no my lord Note this the King is weary

Of dainty and such picking grievances

For he hath found to end one doubt by death

Revives two greater in the heirs of life

And therefore will he wipe his tables clean

And keep no telltale to his memory

That may repeat and history his loss

To new remembrance For full well he knows

He cannot so precisely weed this land

As his misdoubts present occasion

His foes are so enrooted with his friends

That plucking to unfix an enemy

He doth unfasten so and shake a friend

So that this land like an offensive wife

That hath enraged him on to offer strokes

As he is striking holds his infant up

And hangs resolved correction in the arm

That was upreared to execution

'Tis very true

And therefore be assured my good Lord Marshal

If we do now make our atonement well

Our peace will like a broken limb united

Grow stronger for the breaking

Before and greet his GraceMy lord we come

Good my Lord of Lancaster

I am not here against your father's peace

But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland

The time misordered doth in common sense

Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form

To hold our safety up I sent your Grace

The parcels and particulars of our grief

The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court

Whereon this Hydra son of war is born

Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep

With grant of our most just and right desires

And true obedience of this madness cured

Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty

I take your princely word for these redresses

To you my noble Lord of Westmoreland

I do not doubt you

Against ill chances men are ever merry

But heaviness foreruns the good event

Believe me I am passing light in spirit

A peace is of the nature of a conquest

For then both parties nobly are subdued

And neither party loser

Go good Lord Hastings

And ere they be dismissed let them march by

Will you thus break your faith
