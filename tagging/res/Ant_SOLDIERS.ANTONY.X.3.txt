


The gods make this a happy day to Antony

Had'st thou done so

The kings that have revolted and the soldier

That has this morning left thee would have still

Followed thy heels

Who

One ever near thee Call for Enobarbus

He shall not hear thee or from Caesar's camp

Say I am none of thine

Sir

He is with Caesar

Most certain
