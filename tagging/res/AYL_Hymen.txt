Then is there mirth in heaven

When earthly things made even

Atone together

Good duke receive thy daughter

Hymen from heaven brought her

Yea brought her hither

That thou mightst join her hand with his

Whose heart within his bosom is

Peace ho I bar confusion

'Tis I must make conclusion

Of these most strange events

Here's eight that must take hands

To join in Hymen's bands

If truth holds true contents

You and you no cross shall part

You and you are heart in heart

You to his love must accord

Or have a woman to your lord

You and you are sure together

As the winter to foul weather

Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing

Feed yourselves with questioning

That reason wonder may diminish

How thus we met and these things finish
