Marked for the gallows, lay your weapons down!

Home to your cottages; forsake this groom.

The King is merciful, if you revolt.

Villain, thy father was a plasterer,

And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?

Ay, sir.

And will you credit this base drudge’s words,

That speaks he knows not what?

O, gross and miserable ignorance!

Herald, away, and throughout every town

Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade,

That those which fly before the battle ends

May, even in their wives’ and children’s sight

Be hanged up for example at their doors.—

And you that be the King’s friends, follow me.
