Slack the bowlines thereThou wilt not

wilt thou Blow and split thyself

Sir your queen must overboard The sea

works high the wind is loud and will not lie till

the ship be cleared of the dead

Pardon us sir with us at sea it hath been

still observed and we are strong in custom

Therefore briefly yield 'er for she must overboard

straight
