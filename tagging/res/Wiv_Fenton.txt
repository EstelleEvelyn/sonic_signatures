How now, good woman? How dost thou?

What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?

Shall I do any good, think’st thou? Shall I not

lose my suit?

Yes, marry, have I. What of that?

Well, I shall see her today. Hold, there’s

money for thee. Let me

have thy voice in my behalf. If thou see’st her before

me, commend me.

Well, farewell. I am in great haste now.

I see I cannot get thy father’s love;

Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

Why, thou must be thyself.

He doth object I am too great of birth,

And that, my state being galled with my expense,

I seek to heal it only by his wealth.

Besides these, other bars he lays before me—

My riots past, my wild societies—

And tells me ’tis a thing impossible

I should love thee but as a property.

No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!

Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth

Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne,

Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value

Than stamps in gold or sums in sealèd bags.

And ’tis the very riches of thyself

That now I aim at.

Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

Sir, will you hear me?

Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter

In such a righteous fashion as I do,

Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,

I must advance the colors of my love

And not retire. Let me have your good will.

Farewell, gentle mistress.—Farewell, Nan.

I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight

Give my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.

Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,

And, as I am a gentleman, I’ll give thee

A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

From time to time I have acquainted you

With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,

Who mutually hath answered my affection,

So far forth as herself might be her chooser,

Even to my wish. I have a letter from her

Of such contents as you will wonder at,

The mirth whereof so larded with my matter

That neither singly can be manifested

Without the show of both. Fat Falstaff

Hath a great scene; the image of the jest

I’ll show you here at large.Hark, good mine Host:

Tonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one,

Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen—

The purpose why is here—in which disguise,

While other jests are something rank on foot,

Her father hath commanded her to slip

Away with Slender, and with him at Eton

Immediately to marry. She hath consented. Now, sir,

Her mother, ever strong against that match

And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed

That he shall likewise shuffle her away,

While other sports are tasking of their minds,

And at the dean’ry, where a priest attends,

Straight marry her. To this her mother’s plot

She, seemingly obedient, likewise hath

Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:

Her father means she shall be all in white,

And in that habit, when Slender sees his time

To take her by the hand and bid her go,

She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended

The better to denote her to the doctor—

For they must all be masked and vizarded—

That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,

With ribbons pendent flaring ’bout her head;

And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,

To pinch her by the hand, and on that token

The maid hath given consent to go with him.

Both, my good Host, to go along with me.

And here it rests, that you’ll procure the vicar

To stay for me at church ’twixt twelve and one,

And, in the lawful name of marrying,

To give our hearts united ceremony.

So shall I evermore be bound to thee;

Besides, I’ll make a present recompense.

You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.

You would have married her most shamefully,

Where there was no proportion held in love.

The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,

Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.

Th’ offense is holy that she hath committed,

And this deceit loses the name of craft,

Of disobedience, or unduteous title,

Since therein she doth evitate and shun

A thousand irreligious cursèd hours

Which forcèd marriage would have brought upon her.
