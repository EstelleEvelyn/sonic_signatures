You made it known to us.

We are men, my liege.

And I another

So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,

That I would set my life on any chance,

To mend it or be rid on ’t.

True, my lord.

Though our lives—

We are resolved, my lord.

But who did bid thee join with us?

Then stand with us.—

The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.

Now spurs the lated traveler apace

To gain the timely inn, and near approaches

The subject of our watch.

His horses go about.

Stand to ’t.

Let it come down!

Was ’t not the way?

Well, let’s away and say how much is done.

’Tis Banquo’s then.

My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.

Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.

Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,

With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head,

The least a death to nature.
