


While we pursued the horsemen of the north

He slyly stole away and left his men

Whereat the great lord of Northumberland

Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat

Cheered up the drooping army and himself

Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast

Charged our main battle's front and breaking in

Were by the swords of common soldiers slain

Richard hath best deserved of all my sons

But is your Grace dead my lord of Somerset

Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will

For hither we have broken in by force

Thanks gentle Norfolk Stay by me my lords

And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night

The Queen this day here holds her parliament

But little thinks we shall be of her council

By words or blows here let us win our right

Then leave me not my lords be resolute

I mean to take possession of my right

I am thine

It was my inheritance as the earldom was

It must and shall be so Content thyself

Will you we show our title to the crown

If not our swords shall plead it in the field

Sons peace

'Twas by rebellion against his king

What then

He rose against him being his sovereign

And made him to resign his crown perforce

Why whisper you my lords and answer not

Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown

What mutter you or what conspire you lords

Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs

And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st

This oath I willingly take and will perform

Now York and Lancaster are reconciled

Farewell my gracious lord I'll to my castle

Why how now sons and brother at a strife

What is your quarrel How began it first

About what

Mine boy Not till King Henry be dead

I took an oath that he should quietly reign

I shall be if I claim by open war

Thou canst not son it is impossible

Richard enough I will be king or die

Brother thou shalt to London presently

And whet on Warwick to this enterprise

Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk

And tell him privily of our intent

You Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham

With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise

In them I trust for they are soldiers

Witty courteous liberal full of spirit

While you are thus employed what resteth more

But that I seek occasion how to rise

And yet the King not privy to my drift

Nor any of the house of Lancaster

But stay what news Why com'st thou in such post

Ay with my sword What think'st thou that we fear them

Edward and Richard you shall stay with me

My brother Montague shall post to London

Let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest

Whom we have left Protectors of the King

With powerful policy strengthen themselves

And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths

Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles

You are come to Sandal in a happy hour

The army of the Queen mean to besiege us

What with five thousand men

Five men to twenty though the odds be great

I doubt not uncle of our victory

Many a battle have I won in France

Whenas the enemy hath been ten to one

Why should I not now have the like success

The army of the Queen hath got the field

My uncles both are slain in rescuing me

And all my followers to the eager foe

Turn back and fly like ships before the wind

Or lambs pursued by hunger-starvd wolves

My sons God knows what hath bechancd them

But this I know they have demeaned themselves

Like men borne to renown by life or death

Three times did Richard make a lane to me

And thrice cried Courage father fight it out

And full as oft came Edward to my side

With purple falchion painted to the hilt

In blood of those that had encountered him

And when the hardiest warriors did retire

Richard cried Charge and give no foot of ground

And cried A crown or else a glorious tomb

A scepter or an earthly sepulcher

With this we charged again but out alas

We budged again as I have seen a swan

With bootless labor swim against the tide

And spend her strength with over-matching waves

Ah hark the fatal followers do pursue

And I am faint and cannot fly their fury

And were I strong I would not shun their fury

The sands are numbered that makes up my life

Here must I stay and here my life must end

Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland

I dare your quenchless fury to more rage

I am your butt and I abide your shot

My ashes as the Phoenix' may bring forth

A bird that will revenge upon you all

And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven

Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with

Why come you not What multitudes and fear

O Clifford but bethink thee once again

And in thy thought o'errun my former time

And if thou canst for blushing view this face

And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice

Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this

So triumph thieves upon their conquered booty

So true men yield with robbers so o'ermatched

She-wolf of France but worse than wolves of France

Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth

How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex

To triumph like an Amazonian trull

Upon their woes whom Fortune captivates

But that thy face is vizard-like unchanging

Made impudent with use of evil deeds

I would assay proud queen to make thee blush

To tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom derived

Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless

Thy father bears the type of King of Naples

Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem

Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman

Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult

It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen

Unless the adage must be verified

That beggars mounted run their horse to death

'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud

But God He knows thy share thereof is small

'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired

The contrary doth make thee wondered at

'Tis government that makes them seem divine

The want thereof makes thee abominable

Thou art as opposite to every good

As the Antipodes are unto us

Or as the south to the Septentrion

O tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide

How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child

To bid the father wipe his eyes withal

And yet be seen to bear a woman's face

Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible

Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless

Bidd'st thou me rage Why now thou hast thy wish

Wouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will

For raging wind blows up incessant showers

And when the rage allays the rain begins

These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies

And every drop cries vengeance for his death

'Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman

That face of his the hungry cannibals

Would not have touched would not have stained with blood

But you are more inhuman more inexorable

O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania

See ruthless queen a hapless father's tears

This cloth thou dipped'st in blood of my sweet boy

And I with tears do wash the blood away

Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this

And if thou tell'st the heavy story right

Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears

Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears

And say Alas it was a piteous deed

There take the crown and with the crown my curse

And in thy need such comfort come to thee

As now I reap at thy too cruel hand

Hard-hearted Clifford take me from the world

My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads

Open thy gate of mercy gracious God

My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee
