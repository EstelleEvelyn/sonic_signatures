


Four days will quickly steep themselves in night

Four nights will quickly dream away the time

And then the moon like to a silver bow

-bent in heaven shall behold the night

Of our solemnities

I was with Hercules and Cadmus once

When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear

With hounds of Sparta Never did I hear

Such gallant chiding for besides the groves

The skies the fountains every region near

Seemed all one mutual cry I never heard

So musical a discord such sweet thunder

'Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of

But all the story of the night told over

And all their minds transfigured so together

More witnesseth than fancy's images

And grows to something of great constancy

But howsoever strange and admirable

I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharged

And duty in his service perishing

He says they can do nothing in this kind

Indeed he hath played on this prologue like

a child on a recordera sound but not in

government

This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard

It must be your imagination then and not

theirs

I am aweary of this moon Would he would

change

Well shone Moon Truly the Moon shines

with a good grace

Beshrew my heart but I pity the man

How chance Moonshine is gone before

Thisbe comes back and finds her lover

Methinks she should not use a long one for

such a Pyramus I hope she will be brief
