


Proceed Solinus to procure my fall

And by the doom of death end woes and all

Yet this my comfort when your words are done

My woes end likewise with the evening sun

A heavier task could not have been imposed

Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable

Yet that the world may witness that my end

Was wrought by nature not by vile offense

I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave

In Syracusa was I born and wed

Unto a woman happy but for me

And by me had not our hap been bad

With her I lived in joy Our wealth increased

By prosperous voyages I often made

To Epidamium till my factor's death

And the great care of goods at random left

Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse

From whom my absence was not six months old

Before herselfalmost at fainting under

The pleasing punishment that women bear

Had made provision for her following me

And soon and safe arrivd where I was

There had she not been long but she became

A joyful mother of two goodly sons

And which was strange the one so like the other

As could not be distinguished but by names

That very hour and in the selfsame inn

A mean woman was deliverd

Of such a burden male twins both alike

Those for their parents were exceeding poor

I bought and brought up to attend my sons

My wife not meanly proud of two such boys

Made daily motions for our home return

Unwilling I agreed Alas too soon

We came aboard

A league from Epidamium had we sailed

Before the always-wind-obeying deep

Gave any tragic instance of our harm

But longer did we not retain much hope

For what obscurd light the heavens did grant

Did but convey unto our fearful minds

A doubtful warrant of immediate death

Which though myself would gladly have embraced

Yet the incessant weepings of my wife

Weeping before for what she saw must come

And piteous plainings of the pretty babes

That mourned for fashion ignorant what to fear

Forced me to seek delays for them and me

And this it was for other means was none

The sailors sought for safety by our boat

And left the ship then sinking-ripe to us

My wife more careful for the latter-born

Had fastened him unto a small spare mast

Such as seafaring men provide for storms

To him one of the other twins was bound

Whilst I had been like heedful of the other

The children thus disposed my wife and I

Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed

Fastened ourselves at either end the mast

And floating straight obedient to the stream

Was carried towards Corinth as we thought

At length the sun gazing upon the earth

Dispersed those vapors that offended us

And by the benefit of his wished light

The seas waxed calm and we discoverd

Two ships from far making amain to us

Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this

But ere they cameO let me say no more

Gather the sequel by that went before

O had the gods done so I had not now

Worthily termed them merciless to us

For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues

We were encountered by a mighty rock

Which being violently borne upon

Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst

So that in this unjust divorce of us

Fortune had left to both of us alike

What to delight in what to sorrow for

Her part poor soul seeming as burdend

With lesser weight but not with lesser woe

Was carried with more speed before the wind

And in our sight they three were taken up

By fishermen of Corinth as we thought

At length another ship had seized on us

And knowing whom it was their hap to save

Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests

And would have reft the fishers of their prey

Had not their bark been very slow of sail

And therefore homeward did they bend their course

Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss

That by misfortunes was my life prolonged

To tell sad stories of my own mishaps

My youngest boy and yet my eldest care

At eighteen years became inquisitive

After his brother and importuned me

That his attendantso his case was like

Reft of his brother but retained his name

Might bear him company in the quest of him

Whom whilst I labored of a love to see

I hazarded the loss of whom I loved

Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece

Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia

And coasting homeward came to Ephesus

Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought

Or that or any place that harbors men

But here must end the story of my life

And happy were I in my timely death

Could all my travels warrant me they live

Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend

But to procrastinate his lifeless end

Unless the fear of death doth make me dote

I see my son Antipholus and Dromio

Most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word

Haply I see a friend will save my life

And pay the sum that may deliver me

Is not your name sir called Antipholus

And is not that your bondman Dromio

I am sure you both of you remember me

Why look you strange on me You know me well

O grief hath changed me since you saw me last

And careful hours with time's deformd hand

Have written strange defeatures in my face

But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice

Dromio nor thou

I am sure thou dost

Not know my voice O time's extremity

Hast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tongue

In seven short years that here my only son

Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares

Though now this graind face of mine be hid

In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow

And all the conduits of my blood froze up

Yet hath my night of life some memory

My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left

My dull deaf ears a little use to hear

All these old witnessesI cannot err

Tell me thou art my son Antipholus

But seven years since in Syracusa boy

Thou know'st we parted But perhaps my son

Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery

If I dream not thou art Emilia

If thou art she tell me where is that son

That floated with thee on the fatal raft
