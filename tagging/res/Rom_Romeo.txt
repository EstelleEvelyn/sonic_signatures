
Is the day so young?

Ay me, sad hours seem long.

Was that my father that went hence so fast?

Not having that which, having, makes them short.

Out—

Out of her favor where I am in love.

Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,

Should without eyes see pathways to his will!

Where shall we dine?—O me! What fray was here?

Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.

Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.

Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,

O anything of nothing first create!

O heavy lightness, serious vanity,

Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,

Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,

Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!

This love feel I, that feel no love in this.

Dost thou not laugh?

Good heart, at what?

Why, such is love’s transgression.

Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,

Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed

With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown

Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.

Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;

Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;

Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.

What is it else? A madness most discreet,

A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.

Farewell, my coz.

Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.

This is not Romeo. He’s some other where.

What, shall I groan and tell thee?

A sick man in sadness makes his will—

A word ill urged to one that is so ill.

In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

A right good markman! And she’s fair I love.

Well in that hit you miss. She’ll not be hit

With Cupid’s arrow. She hath Dian’s wit,

And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,

From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.

She will not stay the siege of loving terms,

Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,

Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.

O, she is rich in beauty, only poor

That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;

For beauty, starved with her severity,

Cuts beauty off from all posterity.

She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,

To merit bliss by making me despair.

She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow

Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.

O, teach me how I should forget to think!

’Tis the way

To call hers, exquisite, in question more.

These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,

Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.

He that is strucken blind cannot forget

The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.

Show me a mistress that is passing fair;

What doth her beauty serve but as a note

Where I may read who passed that passing fair?

Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

For your broken shin.

Not mad, but bound more than a madman is,

Shut up in prison, kept without my food,

Whipped and tormented, and—good e’en, good fellow.

Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

Stay, fellow. I can read.

Signior Martino and his wife and daughters,

County Anselme and his beauteous sisters,

The lady widow of Vitruvio,

Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces,

Mercutio and his brother Valentine,

Mine Uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters,

My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,

Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,

Lucio and the lively Helena.

A fair assembly. Whither should they come?

Whither? To supper?

Whose house?

Indeed I should have asked thee that before.

When the devout religion of mine eye

Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;

And these who, often drowned, could never die,

Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.

One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun

Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.

I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,

But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?

Or shall we on without apology?

Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.

Being but heavy I will bear the light.

Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes

With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead

So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft

To soar with his light feathers, and so bound

I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.

Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.

Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,

Too rude, too boist’rous, and it pricks like thorn.

A torch for me. Let wantons light of heart

Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,

For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase:

I’ll be a candle holder and look on;

The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.

Nay, that’s not so.

And we mean well in going to this masque,

But ’tis no wit to go.

I dreamt a dream tonight.

Well, what was yours?

In bed asleep while they do dream things true.

Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.

Thou talk’st of nothing.

I fear too early, for my mind misgives

Some consequence yet hanging in the stars

Shall bitterly begin his fearful date

With this night’s revels, and expire the term

Of a despisèd life closed in my breast

By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

But he that hath the steerage of my course

Direct my sail. On, lusty gentlemen.

What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand

Of yonder knight?

O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear—

Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows

As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.

The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand

And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.

Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,

For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.

If I profane with my unworthiest hand

This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.

They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.

Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.

Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!

Give me my sin again.

What is her mother?

Is she a Capulet?

O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.

Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

Can I go forward when my heart is here?

Turn back, dull earth, and find thy center out.

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

Who is already sick and pale with grief

That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.

Be not her maid since she is envious.

Her vestal livery is but sick and green,

And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.

It is my lady. O, it is my love!

O, that she knew she were!

She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?

Her eye discourses; I will answer it.

I am too bold. ’Tis not to me she speaks.

Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,

Having some business, do entreat her eyes

To twinkle in their spheres till they return.

What if her eyes were there, they in her head?

The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars

As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven

Would through the airy region stream so bright

That birds would sing and think it were not night.

See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.

O, that I were a glove upon that hand,

That I might touch that cheek!

She speaks.

O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art

As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,

As is a wingèd messenger of heaven

Unto the white-upturnèd wond’ring eyes

Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him

When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds

And sails upon the bosom of the air.

Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

I take thee at thy word.

Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized.

Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

By a name

I know not how to tell thee who I am.

My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself

Because it is an enemy to thee.

Had I it written, I would tear the word.

Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,

For stony limits cannot hold love out,

And what love can do, that dares love attempt.

Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye

Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,

And I am proof against their enmity.

I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,

And, but thou love me, let them find me here.

My life were better ended by their hate

Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.

By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.

He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.

I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far

As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,

I should adventure for such merchandise.

Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow,

That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops—

What shall I swear by?

If my heart’s dear love—

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.

Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

O blessèd, blessèd night! I am afeard,

Being in night, all this is but a dream,

Too flattering sweet to be substantial.

So thrive my soul—

A thousand times the worse to want thy light.

Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,

But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

It is my soul that calls upon my name.

How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,

Like softest music to attending ears.

My dear.

By the hour of nine.

Let me stand here till thou remember it.

And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,

Forgetting any other home but this.

I would I were thy bird.

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.

Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.

Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell,

His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

Good morrow, father.

That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.

With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.

I have forgot that name and that name’s woe.

I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.

I have been feasting with mine enemy,

Where on a sudden one hath wounded me

That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies

Within thy help and holy physic lies.

I bear no hatred, blessèd man, for, lo,

My intercession likewise steads my foe.

Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set

On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,

And all combined, save what thou must combine

By holy marriage. When and where and how

We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow

I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,

That thou consent to marry us today.

Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.

And bad’st me bury love.

I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now

Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.

The other did not so.

O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.

Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit

did I give you?

Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was

great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain

courtesy.

Meaning, to curtsy.

A most courteous exposition.

“Pink” for flower.

Why, then is my pump well flowered.

O single-soled jest, solely singular for the

singleness.

Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll cry

a match.

Thou wast never with me for anything when

thou wast not there for the goose.

Nay, good goose, bite not.

And is it not, then, well served into a sweet

goose?

I stretch it out for that word “broad,” which

added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a

broad goose.

Here’s goodly gear. A sail, a sail!

One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself

to mar.

I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older

when you have found him than he was when you

sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for

fault of a worse.

What hast thou found?

I will follow you.

A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself

talk and will speak more in a minute than he will

stand to in a month.

Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.

I protest unto thee—

What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not

mark me.

Bid her devise

Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,

And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell

Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

Go to, I say you shall.

And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.

Within this hour my man shall be with thee

And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,

Which to the high topgallant of my joy

Must be my convoy in the secret night.

Farewell. Be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains.

Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.

What sayst thou, my dear nurse?

Warrant thee, my man’s as true as steel.

Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.

Commend me to thy lady.

Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,

It cannot countervail the exchange of joy

That one short minute gives me in her sight.

Do thou but close our hands with holy words,

Then love-devouring death do what he dare,

It is enough I may but call her mine.

Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy

Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more

To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath

This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue

Unfold the imagined happiness that both

Receive in either by this dear encounter.

Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee

Doth much excuse the appertaining rage

To such a greeting. Villain am I none.

Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.

I do protest I never injured thee

But love thee better than thou canst devise

Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.

And so, good Capulet, which name I tender

As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.

Gentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage!

Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath

Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.

Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.

I thought all for the best.

This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,

My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt

In my behalf. My reputation stained

With Tybalt’s slander—Tybalt, that an hour

Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,

Thy beauty hath made me effeminate

And in my temper softened valor’s steel.

This day’s black fate on more days doth depend.

This but begins the woe others must end.

Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!

Away to heaven, respective lenity,

And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.—

Now, Tybalt, take the “villain” back again

That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio’s soul

Is but a little way above our heads,

Staying for thine to keep him company.

Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.

This shall determine that.

O, I am Fortune’s fool!

Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?

What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand

That I yet know not?

What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?

Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say “death,”

For exile hath more terror in his look,

Much more than death. Do not say “banishment.”

There is no world without Verona walls

But purgatory, torture, hell itself.

Hence “banishèd” is “banished from the world,”

And world’s exile is death. Then “banishèd”

Is death mistermed. Calling death “banishèd,”

Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax

And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here

Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog

And little mouse, every unworthy thing,

Live here in heaven and may look on her,

But Romeo may not. More validity,

More honorable state, more courtship lives

In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize

On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand

And steal immortal blessing from her lips,

Who even in pure and vestal modesty

Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;

But Romeo may not; he is banishèd.

Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.

They are free men, but I am banishèd.

And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?

Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife,

No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,

But “banishèd” to kill me? “Banishèd”?

O friar, the damnèd use that word in hell.

Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,

Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,

A sin absolver, and my friend professed,

To mangle me with that word “banishèd”?

O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

Yet “banishèd”? Hang up philosophy.

Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,

Displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,

It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.

How should they when that wise men have no eyes?

Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.

Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,

An hour but married, Tybalt murderèd,

Doting like me, and like me banishèd,

Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair

And fall upon the ground as I do now,

Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,

Mistlike, enfold me from the search of eyes.

Nurse.

Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?

Doth not she think me an old murderer,

Now I have stained the childhood of our joy

With blood removed but little from her own?

Where is she? And how doth she? And what says

My concealed lady to our canceled love?

As if that name,

Shot from the deadly level of a gun,

Did murder her, as that name’s cursèd hand

Murdered her kinsman.—O, tell me, friar, tell me,

In what vile part of this anatomy

Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack

The hateful mansion.

Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

How well my comfort is revived by this!

But that a joy past joy calls out on me,

It were a grief so brief to part with thee.

Farewell.

It was the lark, the herald of the morn,

No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks

Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.

Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day

Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.

I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

Let me be ta’en; let me be put to death.

I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

I’ll say yon gray is not the morning’s eye;

’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.

Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat

The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.

I have more care to stay than will to go.

Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.

How is ’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.

More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.

Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I’ll descend.

Farewell.

I will omit no opportunity

That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve

For sweet discourses in our times to come.

And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.

Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.

If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,

My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.

My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne,

And all this day an unaccustomed spirit

Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.

I dreamt my lady came and found me dead

(Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)

And breathed such life with kisses in my lips

That I revived and was an emperor.

Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed

When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!

News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar?

Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?

How doth my lady? Is my father well?

How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,

For nothing can be ill if she be well.

Is it e’en so?—Then I deny you, stars!—

Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,

And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.

Tush, thou art deceived.

Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.

Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?

No matter. Get thee gone,

And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.

Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.

Let’s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift

To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.

I do remember an apothecary

(And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted

In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,

Culling of simples. Meager were his looks.

Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.

And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,

An alligator stuffed, and other skins

Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,

A beggarly account of empty boxes,

Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,

Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses

Were thinly scattered to make up a show.

Noting this penury, to myself I said

“An if a man did need a poison now,

Whose sale is present death in Mantua,

Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.”

O, this same thought did but forerun my need,

And this same needy man must sell it me.

As I remember, this should be the house.

Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.—

What ho, Apothecary!

Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.

Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have

A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear

As will disperse itself through all the veins,

That the life-weary taker may fall dead,

And that the trunk may be discharged of breath

As violently as hasty powder fired

Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.

Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,

And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,

Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,

Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.

The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law.

The world affords no law to make thee rich.

Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,

Doing more murder in this loathsome world

Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.

I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.

Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.

Come, cordial and not poison, go with me

To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.

Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.

Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning

See thou deliver it to my lord and father.

Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,

Whate’er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof

And do not interrupt me in my course.

Why I descend into this bed of death

Is partly to behold my lady’s face,

But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger

A precious ring, a ring that I must use

In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.

But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry

In what I farther shall intend to do,

By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint

And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.

The time and my intents are savage-wild,

More fierce and more inexorable far

Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.

Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.

Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,

Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,

Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,

And in despite I’ll cram thee with more food.

I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.

Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp’rate man.

Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.

Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,

Put not another sin upon my head

By urging me to fury. O, begone!

By heaven, I love thee better than myself,

For I come hither armed against myself.

Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say

A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.

Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!

In faith, I will.—Let me peruse this face.

Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!

What said my man when my betossèd soul

Did not attend him as we rode? I think

He told me Paris should have married Juliet.

Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?

Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,

To think it was so?—O, give me thy hand,

One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book!

I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.—

A grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,

For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes

This vault a feasting presence full of light.—

Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.

How oft when men are at the point of death

Have they been merry, which their keepers call

A light’ning before death! O, how may I

Call this a light’ning?—O my love, my wife,

Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,

Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

Thou art not conquered. Beauty’s ensign yet

Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,

And death’s pale flag is not advancèd there.—

Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?

O, what more favor can I do to thee

Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain

To sunder his that was thine enemy?

Forgive me, cousin.—Ah, dear Juliet,

Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe

That unsubstantial death is amorous,

And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps

Thee here in dark to be his paramour?

For fear of that I still will stay with thee

And never from this palace of dim night

Depart again. Here, here will I remain

With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here

Will I set up my everlasting rest

And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars

From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.

Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you

The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss

A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!

Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on

The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!

Here’s to my love. O true apothecary,

Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
