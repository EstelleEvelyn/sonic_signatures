here It is written that the shoemaker should

meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the

fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets

But I am sent to find those persons whose names

are here writ and can never find what names the

writing person hath here writ I must to the learned

In good time

God gi' good e'en I pray sir can you

read

Perhaps you have learned it without

book But I pray can you read anything you see

You say honestly Rest you merry

Up

To our house

My master's

Now I'll tell you without asking My

master is the great rich Capulet and if you be not

of the house of Montagues I pray come and crush a

cup of wine Rest you merry
