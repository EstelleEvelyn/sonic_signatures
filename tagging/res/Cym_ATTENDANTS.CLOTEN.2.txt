patience.

His steel was in debt; it went o’

th’ backside the town.

No, but he fled forward still,

toward your face.

As many inches as you have

oceans. Puppies!

So would I, till you had measured

how long a fool you were upon the ground.

If it be a sin to make a true election,

she is damned.

She shines not upon fools, lest

the reflection should hurt her.

I wish not so, unless it had been

the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.

Well, my lord.

If his wit had been like him that

broke it, it would have run all out.

No, my lord, nor crop the ears

of them.

To have smelled like a fool.

You are cock and capon too, and

you crow cock with your comb on.

It is not fit your Lordship should undertake

every companion that you give offense to.

Ay, it is fit for your Lordship only.

He’s a strange fellow himself and

knows it not.

You cannot derogate, my lord.

You are a fool granted; therefore

your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

I’ll attend your Lordship.

That such a crafty devil as is his mother

Should yield the world this ass! A woman that

Bears all down with her brain, and this her son

Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,

And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,

Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur’st,

Betwixt a father by thy stepdame governed,

A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer

More hateful than the foul expulsion is

Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act

Of the divorce he’d make! The heavens hold firm

The walls of thy dear honor, keep unshaked

That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand

T’ enjoy thy banished lord and this great land.

Here comes the King.
