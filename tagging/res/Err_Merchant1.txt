Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.

This very day a Syracusian merchant

Is apprehended for arrival here

And, not being able to buy out his life,

According to the statute of the town

Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.

There is your money that I had to keep.

I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,

Of whom I hope to make much benefit.

I crave your pardon. Soon at five o’clock,

Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart

And afterward consort you till bedtime.

My present business calls me from you now.

Sir, I commend you to your own content.
