


Caesar my lord

I shall remember

When Caesar says Do this it is performed

Caesar

Fear him not Caesar he's not dangerous

He is a noble Roman and well given

So to most noble Caesar

O mighty Caesar dost thou lie so low

Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils

Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well

I know not gentlemen what you intend

Who else must be let blood who else is rank

If I myself there is no hour so fit

As Caesar's death's hour nor no instrument

Of half that worth as those your swords made rich

With the most noble blood of all this world

I do beseech you if you bear me hard

Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke

Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years

I shall not find myself so apt to die

No place will please me so no mean of death

As here by Caesar and by you cut off

The choice and master spirits of this age

I doubt not of your wisdom

Let each man render me his bloody hand

First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you

Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand

Now Decius Brutus yoursnow yours Metellus

Yours Cinnaand my valiant Casca yours

Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius

Gentlemen allalas what shall I say

My credit now stands on such slippery ground

That one of two bad ways you must conceit me

Either a coward or a flatterer

That I did love thee Caesar O 'tis true

If then thy spirit look upon us now

Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death

To see thy Antony making his peace

Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes

Most noblein the presence of thy corpse

Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds

Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood

It would become me better than to close

In terms of friendship with thine enemies

Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bayed brave hart

Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand

Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe

O world thou wast the forest to this hart

And this indeed O world the heart of thee

How like a deer strucken by many princes

Dost thou here lie

Pardon me Caius Cassius

The enemies of Caesar shall say this

Then in a friend it is cold modesty

Therefore I took your hands but was indeed

Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar

Friends am I with you all and love you all

Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons

Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous

That's all I seek

And am moreover suitor that I may

Produce his body to the marketplace

And in the pulpit as becomes a friend

Speak in the order of his funeral

Be it so

I do desire no more

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth

That I am meek and gentle with these butchers

Thou art the ruins of the noblest man

That ever livd in the tide of times

Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood

Over thy wounds now do I prophesy

Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips

To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue

A curse shall light upon the limbs of men

Domestic fury and fierce civil strife

Shall cumber all the parts of Italy

Blood and destruction shall be so in use

And dreadful objects so familiar

That mothers shall but smile when they behold

Their infants quartered with the hands of war

All pity choked with custom of fell deeds

And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge

With Ate by his side come hot from hell

Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice

Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war

That this foul deed shall smell above the earth

With carrion men groaning for burial

You serve Octavius Caesar do you not

Caesar did write for him to come to Rome

Thy heart is big Get thee apart and weep

Passion I see is catching for mine eyes

Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine

Began to water Is thy master coming

Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced

Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome

No Rome of safety for Octavius yet

Hie hence and tell him soYet stay awhile

Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse

Into the marketplace There shall I try

In my oration how the people take

The cruel issue of these bloody men

According to the which thou shalt discourse

To young Octavius of the state of things

Lend me your hand

For Brutus' sake I am beholding to you

You gentle Romans

Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears

I come to bury Caesar not to praise him

The evil that men do lives after them

The good is oft interrd with their bones

So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus

Hath told you Caesar was ambitious

If it were so it was a grievous fault

And grievously hath Caesar answered it

Here under leave of Brutus and the rest

For Brutus is an honorable man

So are they all all honorable men

Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral

He was my friend faithful and just to me

But Brutus says he was ambitious

And Brutus is an honorable man

He hath brought many captives home to Rome

Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill

Did this in Caesar seem ambitious

When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious

And Brutus is an honorable man

You all did see that on the Lupercal

I thrice presented him a kingly crown

Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious

And sure he is an honorable man

I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke

But here I am to speak what I do know

You all did love him once not without cause

What cause withholds you then to mourn for him

O judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts

And men have lost their reasonBear with me

My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar

And I must pause till it come back to me

But yesterday the word of Caesar might

Have stood against the world Now lies he there

And none so poor to do him reverence

O masters if I were disposed to stir

Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage

I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong

Who you all know are honorable men

I will not do them wrong I rather choose

To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you

Than I will wrong such honorable men

But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar

I found it in his closet 'Tis his will

Let but the commons hear this testament

Which pardon me I do not mean to read

And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds

And dip their napkins in his sacred blood

Yea beg a hair of him for memory

And dying mention it within their wills

Bequeathing it as a rich legacy

Unto their issue

Have patience gentle friends I must not read it

It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you

You are not wood you are not stones but men

And being men hearing the will of Caesar

It will inflame you it will make you mad

'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs

For if you should O what would come of it

Will you be patient Will you stay awhile

I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it

I fear I wrong the honorable men

Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar I do fear it

You will compel me then to read the will

Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar

And let me show you him that made the will

Shall I descend And will you give me leave

Nay press not so upon me Stand far off

If you have tears prepare to shed them now

You all do know this mantle I remember

The first time ever Caesar put it on

'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent

That day he overcame the Nervii

Look in this place ran Cassius' dagger through

See what a rent the envious Casca made

Through this the well-belovd Brutus stabbed

And as he plucked his cursd steel away

Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it

As rushing out of doors to be resolved

If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no

For Brutus as you know was Caesar's angel

Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him

This was the most unkindest cut of all

For when the noble Caesar saw him stab

Ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms

Quite vanquished him Then burst his mighty heart

And in his mantle muffling up his face

Even at the base of Pompey's statue

Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell

O what a fall was there my countrymen

Then I and you and all of us fell down

Whilst bloody treason flourished over us

O now you weep and I perceive you feel

The dint of pity These are gracious drops

Kind souls what weep you when you but behold

Our Caesar's vesture wounded Look you here

Here is himself marred as you see with traitors

Stay countrymen

Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up

To such a sudden flood of mutiny

They that have done this deed are honorable

What private griefs they have alas I know not

That made them do it They are wise and honorable

And will no doubt with reasons answer you

I come not friends to steal away your hearts

I am no orator as Brutus is

But as you know me all a plain blunt man

That love my friend and that they know full well

That gave me public leave to speak of him

For I have neither wit nor words nor worth

Action nor utterance nor the power of speech

To stir men's blood I only speak right on

I tell you that which you yourselves do know

Show you sweet Caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths

And bid them speak for me But were I Brutus

And Brutus Antony there were an Antony

Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue

In every wound of Caesar that should move

The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny

Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak

Why friends you go to do you know not what

Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves

Alas you know not I must tell you then

You have forgot the will I told you of

Here is the will and under Caesar's seal

To every Roman citizen he gives

To every several man seventy-five drachmas

Hear me with patience

Moreover he hath left you all his walks

His private arbors and new-planted orchards

On this side Tiber He hath left them you

And to your heirs forevercommon pleasures

To walk abroad and recreate yourselves

Here was a Caesar When comes such another

Now let it work Mischief thou art afoot

Take thou what course thou wilt    How now fellow

Where is he

And thither will I straight to visit him

He comes upon a wish Fortune is merry

And in this mood will give us anything

Belike they had some notice of the people

How I had moved them Bring me to Octavius

These many then shall die their names are pricked

He shall not live look with a spot I damn him

But Lepidus go you to Caesar's house

Fetch the will hither and we shall determine

How to cut off some charge in legacies

This is a slight unmeritable man

Meet to be sent on errands Is it fit

The threefold world divided he should stand

One of the three to share it

Octavius I have seen more days than you

And though we lay these honors on this man

To ease ourselves of diverse sland'rous loads

He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold

To groan and sweat under the business

Either led or driven as we point the way

And having brought our treasure where we will

Then take we down his load and turn him off

Like to the empty ass to shake his ears

And graze in commons

So is my horse Octavius and for that

I do appoint him store of provender

It is a creature that I teach to fight

To wind to stop to run directly on

His corporal motion governed by my spirit

And in some taste is Lepidus but so

He must be taught and trained and bid go forth

A barren-spirited fellow one that feeds

On objects arts and imitations

Which out of use and staled by other men

Begin his fashion Do not talk of him

But as a property And now Octavius

Listen great things Brutus and Cassius

Are levying powers We must straight make head

Therefore let our alliance be combined

Our best friends made our means stretched

And let us presently go sit in council

How covert matters may be best disclosed

And open perils surest answerd

Tut I am in their bosoms and I know

Wherefore they do it They could be content

To visit other places and come down

With fearful bravery thinking by this face

To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage

But 'tis not so

Octavius lead your battle softly on

Upon the left hand of the even field

Why do you cross me in this exigent

No Caesar we will answer on their charge

Make forth The Generals would have some words

In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words

Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart

Crying Long live hail Caesar

Not stingless too

Villains you did not so when your vile daggers

Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar

You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds

And bowed like bondmen kissing Caesar's feet

Whilst damnd Casca like a cur behind

Struck Caesar on the neck O you flatterers

Old Cassius still

Where is he

This is not Brutus friend but I assure you

A prize no less in worth Keep this man safe

Give him all kindness I had rather have

Such men my friends than enemies Go on

And see whe'er Brutus be alive or dead

And bring us word unto Octavius' tent

How everything is chanced

This was the noblest Roman of them all

All the conspirators save only he

Did that they did in envy of great Caesar

He only in a general honest thought

And common good to all made one of them

His life was gentle and the elements

So mixed in him that nature might stand up

And say to all the world This was a man
