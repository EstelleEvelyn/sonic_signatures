


Let me hire him too Here's my

coxcomb

Sirrah you were best take my

coxcomb

Why For taking one's part that's out of favor

Nay an thou canst not smile as the

wind sits thou 'lt catch cold shortly There take my

coxcomb Why this fellow has banished two on 's

daughters and did the third a blessing against his

will If thou follow him thou must needs wear my

coxcombHow now nuncle Would I had two

coxcombs and two daughters

If I gave them all my living I'd keep my coxcombs

myself There's mine Beg another of thy

daughters

Truth's a dog must to kennel he must be

whipped out when the Lady Brach may stand by th'

fire and stink

Sirrah I'll teach thee a speech

Mark it nuncle

Have more than thou showest

Speak less than thou knowest

Lend less than thou owest

Ride more than thou goest

Learn more than thou trowest

Set less than thou throwest

Leave thy drink and thy whore

And keep in-a-door

And thou shalt have more

Than two tens to a score

Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer

You gave me nothing for 'tCan you make no use

of nothing nuncle

Prithee tell him so much the rent of his

land comes to He will not believe a Fool

Dost know the difference my boy between a

bitter fool and a sweet one

That lord that counseled thee

To give away thy land

Come place him here by me

Do thou for him stand

The sweet and bitter fool

Will presently appear

The one in motley here

The other found out there

All thy other titles thou hast given away That

thou wast born with

No faith lords and great men will not let me If

I had a monopoly out they would have part on 't

And ladies too they will not let me have all the fool

to myself they'll be snatchingNuncle give me

an egg and I'll give thee two crowns

Why after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat

up the meat the two crowns of the egg When thou

clovest thy crown i' th' middle and gav'st away

both parts thou bor'st thine ass on thy back o'er

the dirt Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown

when thou gav'st thy golden one away If I speak

like myself in this let him be whipped that first

finds it so

Fools had ne'er less grace in a year

For wise men are grown foppish

And know not how their wits to wear

Their manners are so apish

I have used it nuncle e'er since thou mad'st thy

daughters thy mothers For when thou gav'st them

the rod and put'st down thine own breeches

Then they for sudden joy did weep

And I for sorrow sung

That such a king should play bo-peep

And go the fools among

Prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach

thy Fool to lie I would fain learn to lie

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are

They'll have me whipped for speaking true thou 'lt

have me whipped for lying and sometimes I am

whipped for holding my peace I had rather be any

kind o' thing than a Fool And yet I would not be

thee nuncle Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides

and left nothing i' th' middle Here comes one o' the

parings

Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no

need to care for her frowning Now thou art an O

without a figure I am better than thou art now I

am a Fool Thou art nothing Yes

forsooth I will hold my tongue So your face bids

me though you say nothing

Mum mum

He that keeps nor crust nor crumb

Weary of all shall want some

That's a shelled peascod

For you know nuncle

The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long

That it's had it head bit off by it young

So out went the candle and we were left darkling

May not an ass know when the cart draws the

horse Whoop Jug I love thee

Lear's shadow

Which they will make an obedient father

Nuncle Lear Nuncle Lear tarry Take the Fool

with thee

A fox when one has caught her

And such a daughter

Should sure to the slaughter

If my cap would buy a halter

So the Fool follows after

If a man's brains were in 's heels were 't not in

danger of kibes

Then I prithee be merry thy wit shall not go

slipshod

Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly

for though she's as like this as a crab's like an

apple yet I can tell what I can tell

She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab

Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle

on 's face

Why to keep one's eyes of either side 's nose

that what a man cannot smell out he may spy into

Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell

Nor I neither But I can tell why a snail has a

house

Why to put 's head in not to give it away to his

daughters and leave his horns without a case

Thy asses are gone about 'em The reason why

the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty

reason

Yes indeed Thou wouldst make a good Fool

If thou wert my Fool nuncle I'd have thee

beaten for being old before thy time

Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst

been wise

She that's a maid now and laughs at my departure

Shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter

Ha ha he wears cruel garters Horses are tied

by the heads dogs and bears by th' neck monkeys

by th' loins and men by th' legs When a man's

overlusty at legs then he wears wooden

netherstocks

Winter's not gone yet if the wild geese fly that

way

Fathers that wear rags

Do make their children blind

But fathers that bear bags

Shall see their children kind

Fortune that arrant whore

Ne'er turns the key to th' poor

But for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for

thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year

An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that

question thou 'dst well deserved it

We'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee

there's no laboring i' th' winter All that follow

their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and

there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him

that's stinking Let go thy hold when a great wheel

runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following

but the great one that goes upward let him

draw thee after When a wise man gives thee better

counsel give me mine again I would have none but

knaves follow it since a Fool gives it

That sir which serves and seeks for gain

And follows but for form

Will pack when it begins to rain

And leave thee in the storm

But I will tarry the Fool will stay

And let the wise man fly

The knave turns fool that runs away

The Fool no knave perdie

Not i' th' stocks fool

Cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels

when she put 'em i' th' paste alive She knapped

'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried Down

wantons down 'Twas her brother that in pure

kindness to his horse buttered his hay

O nuncle court holy water in a dry house is

better than this rainwater out o' door Good nuncle

in Ask thy daughters' blessing Here's a night

pities neither wise men nor fools

He that has a house to put 's head in has a good

headpiece

The codpiece that will house

Before the head has any

The head and he shall louse

So beggars marry many

The man that makes his toe

What he his heart should make

Shall of a corn cry woe

And turn his sleep to wake

For there was never yet fair woman but she made

mouths in a glass

Marry here's grace and a codpiece that's a

wise man and a fool

He that has and a little tiny wit

With hey ho the wind and the rain

Must make content with his fortunes fit

Though the rain it raineth every day

This is a brave night to cool a courtesan I'll

speak a prophecy ere I go

When priests are more in word than matter

When brewers mar their malt with water

When nobles are their tailors' tutors

No heretics burned but wenches' suitors

When every case in law is right

No squire in debt nor no poor knight

When slanders do not live in tongues

Nor cutpurses come not to throngs

When usurers tell their gold i' th' field

And bawds and whores do churches build

Then shall the realm of Albion

Come to great confusion

Then comes the time who lives to see 't

That going shall be used with feet

This prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before

his time

Come not in here nuncle here's a spirit Help

me help me

A spirit a spirit He says his name's Poor Tom

Nay he reserved a blanket else we had been all

shamed

This cold night will turn us all to fools and

madmen

Prithee nuncle be contented 'Tis a naughty

night to swim in Now a little fire in a wild field

were like an old lecher's hearta small spark all

the rest on 's body cold

Look here comes a walking fire

Prithee nuncle tell me whether a madman be a

gentleman or a yeoman

No he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his

son for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a

gentleman before him

He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf a

horse's health a boy's love or a whore's oath

Her boat hath a leak

And she must not speak

Why she dares not come over to thee

Come hither mistress Is your name Goneril

Cry you mercy I took you for a joint stool

And I'll go to bed at noon
