
I am joyful

To meet the least occasion that may give me

Remembrance of my father-in-law the Duke

To be revenged on him

Sir

I should be glad to hear such news as this

Once every hour

How came

His practices to light

O how how

Has the King this

Will this work

Would he had

Now all my joy

Trace the conjunction

But will the King

Digest this letter of the Cardinal's

The Lord forbid

Sharp enough

Lord for thy justice

I would 'twere something that would fret the string

The master-cord on 's heart

The Lord increase this business

The King that gave it

Thou art a proud traitor priest

Thy ambition

Thou scarlet sin robbed this bewailing land

Of noble Buckingham my father-in-law

The heads of all thy brother cardinals

With thee and all thy best parts bound together

Weighed not a hair of his Plague of your policy

You sent me Deputy for Ireland

Far from his succor from the King from all

That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him

Whilst your great goodness out of holy pity

Absolved him with an ax

By my soul

Your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel

My sword i' th' life blood of thee elseMy lords

Can you endure to hear this arrogance

And from this fellow If we live thus tamely

To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet

Farewell nobility Let his Grace go forward

And dare us with his cap like larks

Yes that goodness

Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one

Into your own hands card'nal by extortion

The goodness of your intercepted packets

You writ to th' Pope against the King Your goodness

Since you provoke me shall be most notorious

My Lord of Norfolk as you are truly noble

As you respect the common good the state

Of our despised nobility our issues

Whom if he live will scarce be gentlemen

Produce the grand sum of his sins the articles

Collected from his lifeI'll startle you

Worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench

Lay kissing in your arms Lord Cardinal

This cannot save you

I thank my memory I yet remember

Some of these articles and out they shall

Now if you can blush and cry Guilty cardinal

You'll show a little honesty

I had rather want those than my head Have at you

First that without the King's assent or knowledge

You wrought to be a legate by which power

You maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops

Item you sent a large commission

To Gregory de Cassado to conclude

Without the King's will or the state's allowance

A league between his Highness and Ferrara

Then that you have sent innumerable substance

By what means got I leave to your own conscience

To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways

You have for dignities to the mere undoing

Of all the kingdom Many more there are

Which since they are of you and odious

I will not taint my mouth with

I forgive him

We are

'Tis no counterfeit

May it please your Grace
