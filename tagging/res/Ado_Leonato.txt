Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.

How many gentlemen have you lost in this

action?

A victory is twice itself when the achiever

brings home full numbers. I find here that Don

Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young

Florentine called Claudio.

He hath an uncle here in Messina will be

very much glad of it.

Did he break out into tears?

A kind overflow of kindness. There are no

faces truer than those that are so washed. How

much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at

weeping!

What is he that you ask for, niece?

Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too

much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.

You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is

a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and

her. They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit

between them.

You will never run mad, niece.

Never came trouble to my house in the

likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone,

comfort should remain, but when you depart from

me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.

Her mother hath many times told me so.

Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a

child.

If you swear, my lord, you shall not be

forsworn. Let me bid you welcome,

my lord, being reconciled to the Prince your brother,

I owe you all duty.

Please it your Grace lead on?

How now, brother, where is my cousin, your

son? Hath he provided this music?

Are they good?

Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?

No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it

appear itself. But I will acquaint my daughter

withal, that she may be the better prepared for an

answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell

her of it.

Cousins, you know what you have to do.—O, I cry

you mercy, friend. Go you with me and I will use

your skill.—Good cousin, have a care this busy

time.

Was not Count John here at supper?

Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in

Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy

in Signior Benedick’s face—

By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a

husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

So, by being too curst, God will send you no

horns.

You may light on a husband that hath no

beard.

Well then, go you into hell?

Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted

with a husband.

Daughter, remember what I told

you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you

know your answer.

Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.

The revelers are entering, brother. Make

good room.

Count, take of me my daughter, and with her

my fortunes. His Grace hath made the match, and

all grace say “Amen” to it.

Niece, will you look to those things I told

you of?

There’s little of the melancholy element in

her, my lord. She is never sad but when she sleeps,

and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter

say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and

waked herself with laughing.

O, by no means. She mocks all her wooers

out of suit.

O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week

married, they would talk themselves mad.

Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence

a just sevennight, and a time too brief, too, to have

all things answer my mind.

My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten

nights’ watchings.

No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that

she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she

hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to

abhor.

By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to

think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged

affection, it is past the infinite of thought.

O God! Counterfeit? There was never counterfeit

of passion came so near the life of passion as

she discovers it.

What effects, my lord? She will sit you—you

heard my daughter tell you how.

I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially

against Benedick.

No, and swears she never will. That’s her

torment.

This says she now when she is beginning to

write to him, for she’ll be up twenty times a night,

and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ

a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us all.

O, when she had writ it and was reading it

over, she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between

the sheet?

O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,

railed at herself that she should be so

immodest to write to one that she knew would flout

her. “I measure him,” says she, “by my own spirit,

for I should flout him if he writ to me, yea, though I

love him, I should.”

She doth indeed, my daughter says so, and

the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my

daughter is sometimes afeared she will do a desperate

outrage to herself. It is very true.

O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in

so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that

blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have

just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.

Were it good, think you?

If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep

peace. If he break the peace, he ought to enter into

a quarrel with fear and trembling.

Nay, that’s impossible; she may wear her

heart out first.

My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.

So say I. Methinks you are sadder.

Where is but a humor or a worm.

Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the

loss of a beard.

What would you with me, honest neighbor?

Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time

with me.

What is it, my good friends?

Neighbors, you are tedious.

All thy tediousness on me, ah?

I would fain know what you have to say.

Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.

I must leave you.

Take their examination yourself and bring it

me. I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto

you.

Drink some wine ere you go. Fare you well.

I’ll wait upon them. I am ready.

Come, Friar Francis, be brief, only to the

plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their

particular duties afterwards.

To be married to her.—Friar, you come to

marry her.

I dare make his answer, none.

As freely, son, as God did give her me.

What do you mean, my lord?

Dear my lord, if you in your own proof

Have vanquished the resistance of her youth,

And made defeat of her virginity—

Sweet prince, why speak not you?

Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?

All this is so, but what of this, my lord?

I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.

Hath no man’s dagger here a point for me?

O Fate, take not away thy heavy hand!

Death is the fairest cover for her shame

That may be wished for.

Dost thou look up?

Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing

Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny

The story that is printed in her blood?—

Do not live, Hero, do not ope thine eyes,

For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,

Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,

Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,

Strike at thy life. Grieved I I had but one?

Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?

O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?

Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?

Why had I not with charitable hand

Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates,

Who, smirchèd thus, and mired with infamy,

I might have said “No part of it is mine;

This shame derives itself from unknown loins”?

But mine, and mine I loved, and mine I praised,

And mine that I was proud on, mine so much

That I myself was to myself not mine,

Valuing of her—why she, O she, is fall’n

Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea

Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,

And salt too little which may season give

To her foul tainted flesh!

Confirmed, confirmed! O, that is stronger made

Which was before barred up with ribs of iron!

Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie,

Who loved her so that, speaking of her foulness,

Washed it with tears? Hence from her. Let her die!

Friar, it cannot be.

Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left

Is that she will not add to her damnation

A sin of perjury. She not denies it.

Why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse

That which appears in proper nakedness?

I know not. If they speak but truth of her,

These hands shall tear her. If they wrong her honor,

The proudest of them shall well hear of it.

Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,

Nor age so eat up my invention,

Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,

Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,

But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,

Both strength of limb and policy of mind,

Ability in means and choice of friends,

To quit me of them throughly.

What shall become of this? What will this do?

Being that I flow in grief,

The smallest twine may lead me.

I pray thee, cease thy counsel,

Which falls into mine ears as profitless

As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,

Nor let no comforter delight mine ear

But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.

Bring me a father that so loved his child,

Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,

And bid him speak of patience.

Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,

And let it answer every strain for strain,

As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,

In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.

If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,

Bid sorrow wag, cry “hem” when he should groan,

Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk

With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me,

And I of him will gather patience.

But there is no such man. For, brother, men

Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief

Which they themselves not feel, but tasting it,

Their counsel turns to passion, which before

Would give preceptial med’cine to rage,

Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,

Charm ache with air and agony with words.

No, no, ’tis all men’s office to speak patience

To those that wring under the load of sorrow,

But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency

To be so moral when he shall endure

The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel.

My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood,

For there was never yet philosopher

That could endure the toothache patiently,

However they have writ the style of gods

And made a push at chance and sufferance.

There thou speak’st reason. Nay, I will do so.

My soul doth tell me Hero is belied,

And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince

And all of them that thus dishonor her.

Hear you, my lords—

Some haste, my lord! Well, fare you well, my lord.

Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one.

Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou.

Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.

I fear thee not.

Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.

I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,

As under privilege of age to brag

What I have done being young, or what would do

Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,

Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me

That I am forced to lay my reverence by,

And with gray hairs and bruise of many days

Do challenge thee to trial of a man.

I say thou hast belied mine innocent child.

Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,

And she lies buried with her ancestors,

O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,

Save this of hers, framed by thy villainy.

Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.

My lord, my lord,

I’ll prove it on his body if he dare,

Despite his nice fence and his active practice,

His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.

Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast killed my child.

If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.

Brother—

Brother Anthony—

But brother Anthony—

My lord, my lord—

No? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.

Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes,

That, when I note another man like him,

I may avoid him. Which of these is he?

Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed

Mine innocent child?

No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself.

Here stand a pair of honorable men—

A third is fled—that had a hand in it.—

I thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death.

Record it with your high and worthy deeds.

’Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.

I cannot bid you bid my daughter live—

That were impossible—but, I pray you both,

Possess the people in Messina here

How innocent she died. And if your love

Can labor aught in sad invention,

Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb

And sing it to her bones. Sing it tonight.

Tomorrow morning come you to my house,

And since you could not be my son-in-law,

Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,

Almost the copy of my child that’s dead,

And she alone is heir to both of us.

Give her the right you should have giv’n her cousin,

And so dies my revenge.

Tomorrow then I will expect your coming.

Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man

Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,

Who I believe was packed in all this wrong,

Hired to it by your brother.

I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

There’s for thy pains.

Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I

thank thee.

Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.

Bring you these fellows on.—We’ll talk with Margaret,

How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.

So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her

Upon the error that you heard debated.

But Margaret was in some fault for this,

Although against her will, as it appears

In the true course of all the question.

Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,

Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,

And when I send for you, come hither masked.

The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour

To visit me.—You know your office, brother.

You must be father to your brother’s daughter,

And give her to young Claudio.

That eye my daughter lent her; ’tis most true.

The sight whereof I think you had from me,

From Claudio, and the Prince. But what’s your will?

My heart is with your liking.

Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio.

We here attend you. Are you yet determined

Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?

Call her forth, brother. Here’s the Friar ready.

This same is she, and I do give you her.

No, that you shall not till you take her hand

Before this friar and swear to marry her.

She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.

Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.

We’ll have dancing afterward.
