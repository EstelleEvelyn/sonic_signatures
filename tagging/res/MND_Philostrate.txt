
Here, mighty Theseus.

There is a brief how many sports are ripe.

Make choice of which your Highness will see first.

A play there is, my lord, some ten words long

(Which is as brief as I have known a play),

But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,

Which makes it tedious; for in all the play,

There is not one word apt, one player fitted.

And tragical, my noble lord, it is.

For Pyramus therein doth kill himself,

Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,

Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears

The passion of loud laughter never shed.

Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,

Which never labored in their minds till now,

And now have toiled their unbreathed memories

With this same play, against your nuptial.

No, my noble lord,

It is not for you. I have heard it over,

And it is nothing, nothing in the world,

Unless you can find sport in their intents,

Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain

To do you service.

So please your Grace, the Prologue is addressed.
