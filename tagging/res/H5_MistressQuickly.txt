


No by my troth not long for we cannot

lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen

that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it

will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight

O well-a-day Lady If he be not hewn now we shall

see willful adultery and murder committed

Good Corporal Nym show thy valor and put

up your sword

By my troth he'll yield the crow a pudding

one of these days The King has killed his heart

Good husband come home presently

As ever you come of women come in quickly

to Sir John Ah poor heart he is so shaked of a

burning quotidian-tertian that it is most lamentable

to behold Sweet men come to him

Prithee honey-sweet husband let me bring

thee to Staines

Nay sure he's not in hell He's in Arthur's

bosom if ever man went to Arthur's bosom He

made a finer end and went away an it had been any

christom child He parted ev'n just between twelve

and one ev'n at the turning o' th' tide for after I saw

him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers

and smile upon his finger's end I knew there was

but one way for his nose was as sharp as a pen and

he talked of green fields How now Sir John

quoth I What man be o' good cheer So he cried

out God God God three or four times Now I to

comfort him bid him he should not think of God I

hoped there was no need to trouble himself with

any such thoughts yet So he bade me lay more

clothes on his feet I put my hand into the bed and

felt them and they were as cold as any stone Then I

felt to his knees and so upward and upward and

all was as cold as any stone

Ay that he did

Nay that he did not

He could never abide carnation 'Twas a

color he never liked

He did in some sort indeed handle women

but then he was rheumatic and talked of the Whore

of Babylon

Farewell Adieu
