Was once superfluous. You were crowned before,

And that high royalty was ne’er plucked off,

The faiths of men ne’er stainèd with revolt;

Fresh expectation troubled not the land

With any longed-for change or better state.

But that your royal pleasure must be done,

This act is as an ancient tale new told,

And, in the last repeating, troublesome,

Being urgèd at a time unseasonable.

When workmen strive to do better than well,

They do confound their skill in covetousness,

And oftentimes excusing of a fault

Doth make the fault the worse by th’ excuse,

As patches set upon a little breach

Discredit more in hiding of the fault

Than did the fault before it was so patched.

Then I, as one that am the tongue of these

To sound the purposes of all their hearts,

Both for myself and them, but chief of all

Your safety, for the which myself and them

Bend their best studies, heartily request

Th’ enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint

Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent

To break into this dangerous argument:

If what in rest you have in right you hold,

Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend

The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up

Your tender kinsman and to choke his days

With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth

The rich advantage of good exercise.

That the time’s enemies may not have this

To grace occasions, let it be our suit

That you have bid us ask, his liberty,

Which for our goods we do no further ask

Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,

Counts it your weal he have his liberty.

This is the man should do the bloody deed.

He showed his warrant to a friend of mine.

The image of a wicked heinous fault

Lives in his eye. That close aspect of his

Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,

And I do fearfully believe ’tis done

What we so feared he had a charge to do.

And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence

The foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.

Indeed, we heard how near his death he was

Before the child himself felt he was sick.

This must be answered either here or hence.

Stay yet, Lord Salisbury. I’ll go with thee

And find th’ inheritance of this poor child,

His little kingdom of a forcèd grave.

That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,

Three foot of it doth hold. Bad world the while!

This must not be thus borne; this will break out

To all our sorrows, and ere long, I doubt.

Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?

Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.

O Death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!

The Earth had not a hole to hide this deed.

All murders past do stand excused in this.

And this, so sole and so unmatchable,

Shall give a holiness, a purity,

To the yet unbegotten sin of times

And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,

Exampled by this heinous spectacle.

Our souls religiously confirm thy words.

Cut him to pieces.

There, tell the King, he may inquire us out.

Up once again. Put spirit in the French.

If they miscarry, we miscarry too.

They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.

It is the Count Melun.

His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief

That being brought into the open air

It would allay the burning quality

Of that fell poison which assaileth him.

He is more patient

Than when you left him. Even now he sung.
