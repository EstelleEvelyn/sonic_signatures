What faults he made before the last, I think

Might have found easy fines, but there to end

Where he was to begin and give away

The benefit of our levies, answering us

With our own charge, making a treaty where

There was a yielding—this admits no excuse.

Peace, both, and hear me speak.

Hold, hold, hold, hold!

O Tullus!

Bear from hence his body,

And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded

As the most noble corse that ever herald

Did follow to his urn.
