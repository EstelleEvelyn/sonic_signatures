


Most true if ever truth were pregnant

by circumstance That which you hear you'll

swear you see there is such unity in the proofs The

mantle of Queen Hermione's her jewel about the

neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it

which they know to be his character the majesty of

the creature in resemblance of the mother the

affection of nobleness which nature shows above

her breeding and many other evidences proclaim

her with all certainty to be the King's daughter Did

you see the meeting of the two kings

Then have you lost a sight which

was to be seen cannot be spoken of There might

you have beheld one joy crown another so and in

such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take

leave of them for their joy waded in tears There

was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with

countenance of such distraction that they were to

be known by garment not by favor Our king being

ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found

daughter as if that joy were now become a loss

cries O thy mother thy mother then asks Bohemia

forgiveness then embraces his son-in-law then

again worries he his daughter with clipping her

Now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by

like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns

I never heard of such another encounter which

lames report to follow it and undoes description to

do it

Like an old tale still which will

have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and

not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear

This avouches the shepherd's son who has not only

his innocence which seems much to justify him

but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina

knows

Wracked the same instant of their

master's death and in the view of the shepherd so

that all the instruments which aided to expose the

child were even then lost when it was found But O

the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was

fought in Paulina She had one eye declined for the

loss of her husband another elevated that the

oracle was fulfilled She lifted the Princess from the

earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would

pin her to her heart that she might no more be in

danger of losing

One of the prettiest touches of all

and that which angled for mine eyescaught the

water though not the fishwas when at the relation

of the Queen's deathwith the manner how

she came to 't bravely confessed and lamented by

the Kinghow attentiveness wounded his daughter

till from one sign of dolor to another she did

with an Alas I would fain say bleed tears for I am

sure my heart wept blood Who was most marble

there changed color some swooned all sorrowed

If all the world could have seen 't the woe had been

universal

No The Princess hearing of her

mother's statue which is in the keeping of

Paulinaa piece many years in doing and now

newly performed by that rare Italian master Julio

Romano who had he himself eternity and could

put breath into his work would beguile Nature of

her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to

Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one

would speak to her and stand in hope of answer

Thither with all greediness of affection are they

gone and there they intend to sup
