Unless we sweep ’em from the door with cannons—

To scatter ’em as ’tis to make ’em sleep

On May Day morning, which will never be.

We may as well push against Paul’s as stir ’em.

Alas, I know not. How gets the tide in?

As much as one sound cudgel of four foot—

You see the poor remainder—could distribute,

I made no spare, sir.

I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,

To mow ’em down before me; but if I spared any

That had a head to hit, either young or old,

He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,

Let me ne’er hope to see a chine again—

And that I would not for a cow, God save her!

What would you have me do?

The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is

a fellow somewhat near the door—he should be a

brazier by his face, for, o’ my conscience, twenty of

the dog days now reign in ’s nose. All that stand

about him are under the line; they need no other

penance. That fire-drake did I hit three times on the

head, and three times was his nose discharged

against me. He stands there like a mortar-piece, to

blow us. There was a haberdasher’s wife of small

wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked

porringer fell off her head for kindling such a

combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once

and hit that woman, who cried out “Clubs!” when I

might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to

her succor, which were the hope o’ th’ Strand, where

she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my

place. At length they came to th’ broomstaff to me;

I defied ’em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind

’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of

pibbles that I was fain to draw mine honor in and

let ’em win the work. The devil was amongst ’em, I

think, surely.

You great fellow,

Stand close up, or I’ll make your head ache.
