
I must not think there are

Evils enough to darken all his goodness

His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven

More fiery by night's blackness hereditary

Rather than purchased what he cannot change

Than what he chooses

Here's more news

'Tis pity of him

Tomorrow Caesar

I shall be furnished to inform you rightly

Both what by sea and land I can be able

To front this present time

Farewell my lord What you shall know meantime

Of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir

To let me be partaker

Good Enobarbus 'tis a worthy deed

And shall become you well to entreat your captain

To soft and gentle speech

'Tis not a time for private stomaching

But small to greater matters must give way

Your speech is passion but pray you stir

No embers up Here comes the noble Antony

Noble friends

That which combined us was most great and let not

A leaner action rend us What's amiss

May it be gently heard When we debate

Our trivial difference loud we do commit

Murder in healing wounds Then noble partners

The rather for I earnestly beseech

Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms

Nor curstness grow to th' matter

Soft Caesar

'Tis noble spoken

Worthily spoken Maecenas

Happily amen

Time calls upon 's

Of us must Pompey presently be sought

Or else he seeks out us

Noble Antony not sickness should detain me

Trouble yourselves no further Pray you hasten

Your generals after

Till I shall see you in your soldiers' dress

Which will become you both farewell

Your way is shorter

My purposes do draw me much about

You'll win two days upon me

Farewell

Be pleased to tell us

For this is from the presenthow you take

The offers we have sent you

That's our offer

Well met here

Show 's the way sir

You've strange serpents there

Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your

mud by the operation of your sun so is your

crocodile

I am not so well as I should be but I'll ne'er

out

Nay certainly I have heard the Ptolemies'

pyramises are very goodly things Without contradiction

I have heard that

What manner o' thing is your crocodile

What color is it of

'Tis a strange serpent

Cup us till the world go round

Cup us till the world go round

Let all the number of the stars give light

To thy fair way
