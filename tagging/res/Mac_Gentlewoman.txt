have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown

upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,

fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and

again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast

sleep.

That, sir, which I will not report after

her.

Neither to you nor anyone, having no

witness to confirm my speech.

Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and,

upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

Why, it stood by her. She has light by

her continually. ’Tis her command.

Ay, but their sense are shut.

It is an accustomed action with her to

seem thus washing her hands. I have known her

continue in this a quarter of an hour.

She has spoke what she should not,

I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has

known.

I would not have such a heart in my

bosom for the dignity of the whole body.

Pray God it be, sir.

Directly.

Good night, good doctor.
