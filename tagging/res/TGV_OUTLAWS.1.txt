That's not so sir We are your enemies

Whence came you

What were you banished thence

Why ne'er repent it if it were done so

But were you banished for so small a fault

We'll have himSirs a word

And I for such like petty crimes as these

But to the purpose for we cite our faults

That they may hold excused our lawless lives

And partly seeing you are beautified

With goodly shape and by your own report

A linguist and a man of such perfection

As we do in our quality much want

But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest

Come come be patient We must bring you to our captain

Where is the gentleman that was with her

Come I must bring you to our captain's cave

Fear not he bears an honorable mind

And will not use a woman lawlessly

A prize a prize a prize
