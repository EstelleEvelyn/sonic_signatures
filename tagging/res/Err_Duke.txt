Merchant of Syracusa plead no more

I am not partial to infringe our laws

The enmity and discord which of late

Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke

To merchants our well-dealing countrymen

Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives

Have sealed his rigorous statutes with their bloods

Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks

For since the mortal and intestine jars

'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us

It hath in solemn synods been decreed

Both by the Syracusians and ourselves

To admit no traffic to our adverse towns

Nay more if any born at Ephesus

Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs

Again if any Syracusian born

Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies

His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose

Unless a thousand marks be levid

To quit the penalty and to ransom him

Thy substance valued at the highest rate

Cannot amount unto a hundred marks

Therefore by law thou art condemned to die

Well Syracusian say in brief the cause

Why thou departedst from thy native home

And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus

Nay forward old man Do not break off so

For we may pity though not pardon thee

And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for

Do me the favor to dilate at full

What have befall'n of them and thee till now

Hapless Egeon whom the fates have marked

To bear the extremity of dire mishap

Now trust me were it not against our laws

Against my crown my oath my dignity

Which princes would they may not disannul

My soul should sue as advocate for thee

But though thou art adjudgd to the death

And passd sentence may not be recalled

But to our honor's great disparagement

Yet will I favor thee in what I can

Therefore merchant I'll limit thee this day

To seek thy life by beneficial help

Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus

Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum

And live If no then thou art doomed to die

Jailer take him to thy custody

Yet once again proclaim it publicly

If any friend will pay the sum for him

He shall not die so much we tender him

She is a virtuous and a reverend lady

It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong

Long since thy husband served me in my wars

And I to thee engaged a prince's word

When thou didst make him master of thy bed

To do him all the grace and good I could

Go some of you knock at the abbey gate

And bid the Lady Abbess come to me

I will determine this before I stir

Come stand by me Fear nothingGuard with halberds

Discover how and thou shalt find me just

A grievous faultSay woman didst thou so

But had he such a chain of thee or no

Why what an intricate impeach is this

I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup

If here you housed him here he would have been

If he were mad he would not plead so coldly

You say he dined at home the goldsmith here

Denies that saying Sirrah what say you

Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here

Why this is strangeGo call the Abbess hither

I think you are all mated or stark mad

Speak freely Syracusian what thou wilt

I tell thee Syracusian twenty years

Have I been patron to Antipholus

During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa

I see thy age and dangers make thee dote

One of these men is genius to the other

And so of these which is the natural man

And which the spirit Who deciphers them

Why here begins his morning story right

These two Antipholus' these two so like

And these two Dromios one in semblance

Besides her urging of her wrack at sea

These are the parents to these children

Which accidentally are met together

Antipholus thou cam'st from Corinth first

Stay stand apart I know not which is which

It shall not need Thy father hath his life

With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast
