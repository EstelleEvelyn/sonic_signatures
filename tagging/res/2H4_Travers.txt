With joyful tidings and, being better horsed,

Outrode me. After him came spurring hard

A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,

That stopped by me to breathe his bloodied horse.

He asked the way to Chester, and of him

I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.

He told me that rebellion had bad luck

And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.

With that he gave his able horse the head

And, bending forward, struck his armèd heels

Against the panting sides of his poor jade

Up to the rowel-head, and starting so

He seemed in running to devour the way,

Staying no longer question.
