


Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds

Breathe Merriman the poor cur is embossed

And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach

Saw'st thou not boy how Silver made it good

At the hedge corner in the coldest fault

I would not lose the dog for twenty pound

Thou art a fool If Echo were as fleet

I would esteem him worth a dozen such

But sup them well and look unto them all

Tomorrow I intend to hunt again

What's here One dead or drunk See doth he breathe

O monstrous beast how like a swine he lies

Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image

Sirs I will practice on this drunken man

What think you if he were conveyed to bed

Wrapped in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers

A most delicious banquet by his bed

And brave attendants near him when he wakes

Would not the beggar then forget himself

Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy

Then take him up and manage well the jest

Carry him gently to my fairest chamber

And hang it round with all my wanton pictures

Balm his foul head in warm distilld waters

And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet

Procure me music ready when he wakes

To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound

And if he chance to speak be ready straight

And with a low submissive reverence

Say What is it your Honor will command

Let one attend him with a silver basin

Full of rosewater and bestrewed with flowers

Another bear the ewer the third a diaper

And say Will 't please your Lordship cool your hands

Someone be ready with a costly suit

And ask him what apparel he will wear

Another tell him of his hounds and horse

And that his lady mourns at his disease

Persuade him that he hath been lunatic

And when he says he is say that he dreams

For he is nothing but a mighty lord

This do and do it kindly gentle sirs

It will be pastime passing excellent

If it be husbanded with modesty

Take him up gently and to bed with him

And each one to his office when he wakes

Sirrah go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds

Belike some noble gentleman that means

Traveling some journey to repose him here

How now Who is it

Bid them come near    Now fellows you are welcome

Do you intend to stay with me tonight

With all my heart This fellow I remember

Since once he played a farmer's eldest son

'Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well

I have forgot your name but sure that part

Was aptly fitted and naturally performed

'Tis very true Thou didst it excellent

Well you are come to me in happy time

The rather for I have some sport in hand

Wherein your cunning can assist me much

There is a lord will hear you play tonight

But I am doubtful of your modesties

Lest over-eying of his odd behavior

For yet his Honor never heard a play

You break into some merry passion

And so offend him For I tell you sirs

If you should smile he grows impatient

Go sirrah take them to the buttery

And give them friendly welcome every one

Let them want nothing that my house affords

Sirrah go you to Bartholomew my page

And see him dressed in all suits like a lady

That done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber

And call him Madam do him obeisance

Tell him from me as he will win my love

He bear himself with honorable action

Such as he hath observed in noble ladies

Unto their lords by them accomplishd

Such duty to the drunkard let him do

With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy

And say What is 't your Honor will command

Wherein your lady and your humble wife

May show her duty and make known her love

And then with kind embracements tempting kisses

And with declining head into his bosom

Bid him shed tears as being overjoyed

To see her noble lord restored to health

Who for this seven years hath esteemed him

No better than a poor and loathsome beggar

And if the boy have not a woman's gift

To rain a shower of commanded tears

An onion will do well for such a shift

Which in a napkin being close conveyed

Shall in despite enforce a watery eye

See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst

Anon I'll give thee more instructions

I know the boy will well usurp the grace

Voice gait and action of a gentlewoman

I long to hear him call the drunkard husband

And how my men will stay themselves from laughter

When they do homage to this simple peasant

I'll in to counsel them Haply my presence

May well abate the over-merry spleen

Which otherwise would grow into extremes

Heaven cease this idle humor in your Honor

O that a mighty man of such descent

Of such possessions and so high esteem

Should be infusd with so foul a spirit

Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house

As beaten hence by your strange lunacy

O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth

Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment

And banish hence these abject lowly dreams

Look how thy servants do attend on thee

Each in his office ready at thy beck

Wilt thou have music Hark Apollo plays

And twenty cagd nightingales do sing

Or wilt thou sleep We'll have thee to a couch

Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed

On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis

Say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground

Or wilt thou ride Thy horses shall be trapped

Their harness studded all with gold and pearl

Dost thou love hawking Thou hast hawks will soar

Above the morning lark Or wilt thou hunt

Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them

And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth

We'll show thee Io as she was a maid

And how she was beguild and surprised

As lively painted as the deed was done

Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord

Thou hast a lady far more beautiful

Than any woman in this waning age

Amen

Madam

Madam and nothing else So lords call ladies
