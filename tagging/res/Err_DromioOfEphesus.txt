


Returned so soon Rather approached too late

The capon burns the pig falls from the spit

The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell

My mistress made it one upon my cheek

She is so hot because the meat is cold

The meat is cold because you come not home

You come not home because you have no stomach

You have no stomach having broke your fast

But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray

Are penitent for your default today

O sixpence that I had o' Wednesday last

To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper

The saddler had it sir I kept it not

I pray you jest sir as you sit at dinner

I from my mistress come to you in post

If I return I shall be post indeed

For she will scour your fault upon my pate

Methinks your maw like mine should be your clock

And strike you home without a messenger

To me sir Why you gave no gold to me

My charge was but to fetch you from the mart

Home to your house the Phoenix sir to dinner

My mistress and her sister stays for you

I have some marks of yours upon my pate

Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders

But not a thousand marks between you both

If I should pay your Worship those again

Perchance you will not bear them patiently

Your Worship's wife my mistress at the Phoenix

She that doth fast till you come home to dinner

And prays that you will hie you home to dinner

What mean you sir For God's sake hold your hands

Nay an you will not sir I'll take my heels

Nay he's at two hands with me

and that my two ears can witness

Ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear

Beshrew his hand I scarce could understand it

Nay he struck so plainly I could

too well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully

that I could scarce understand them

Why mistress sure my master is horn mad

I mean not cuckold mad

But sure he is stark mad

When I desired him to come home to dinner

He asked me for a thousand marks in gold

'Tis dinnertime quoth I My gold quoth he

Your meat doth burn quoth I My gold quoth he

Will you come quoth I My gold quoth he

Where is the thousand marks I gave thee villain

The pig quoth I is burned My gold quoth he

My mistress sir quoth I Hang up thy mistress

I know not thy mistress Out on thy mistress

Quoth my master

I know quoth he no house no wife no mistress

So that my errand due unto my tongue

I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders

For in conclusion he did beat me there

Go back again and be new beaten home

For God's sake send some other messenger

And he will bless that cross with other beating

Between you I shall have a holy head

Am I so round with you as you with me

That like a football you do spurn me thus

You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither

If I last in this service you must case me in leather

Say what you will sir but I know what I know

That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show

If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink

Your own handwriting would tell you what I think

Marry so it doth appear

By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear

I should kick being kicked and being at that pass

You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass

What patch is made our porter My master stays in the street

O villain thou hast stolen both mine office and my name

The one ne'er got me credit the other mickle blame

If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place

Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy name for an ass

Let my master in Luce

O Lord I must laugh

Have at you with a proverb shall I set in my staff

So come help Well struck There was blow for blow

Master knock the door hard

If you went in pain master this knave would go sore

They stand at the door master Bid them welcome hither

You would say so master if your garments were thin

Your cake here is warm within you stand here in the cold

It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold

A man may break a word with you sir and words are but wind

Ay and break it in your face so he break it not behind

Here's too much Out upon thee I pray thee let me in

A crow without feather Master mean you so

For a fish without a fin there's a fowl without a feather

If a crow help us in sirrah well pluck a crow together

I buy a thousand pound a year I buy a rope

Here's that I warrant you will pay them all

Why sir I gave the money for the rope

I'll serve you sir five hundred at the rate

To a rope's end sir and to that

end am I returned

Nay 'tis for me to be patient I am

in adversity

Nay rather persuade him to hold

his hands

I would I were senseless sir that

I might not feel your blows

I am an ass indeed you may

prove it by my long earsI have served him from

the hour of my nativity to this instant and have

nothing at his hands for my service but blows

When I am cold he heats me with beating when I

am warm he cools me with beating I am waked

with it when I sleep raised with it when I sit

driven out of doors with it when I go from home

welcomed home with it when I return Nay I bear it

on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat and I

think when he hath lamed me I shall beg with it

from door to door

Mistress respice finem respect

your end or rather the prophecy like the parrot

Beware the rope's end

Sir sooth to say you did not dine at home

Perdie your doors were locked and you shut out

Sans fable she herself reviled you there

Certes she did the kitchen vestal scorned you

In verity you didMy bones bears witness

That since have felt the vigor of his rage

Money by me Heart and goodwill you might

But surely master not a rag of money

God and the rope-maker bear me witness

That I was sent for nothing but a rope

And gentle master I received no gold

But I confess sir that we were locked out

Master I am here entered in bond for you

Will you be bound for nothing Be mad good master

Cry The devil

Sir he dined with her there at the Porpentine

Within this hour I was his bondman sir

But he I thank him gnawed in two my cords

Now am I Dromio and his man unbound

Ourselves we do remember sir by you

For lately we were bound as you are now

You are not Pinch's patient are you sir

No trust me sir nor I

Ay sir but I am sure I do not and

whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to

believe him

I sir am Dromio Pray let me stay

And I with him

No none by me

Methinks you are my glass and not my brother

I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth

Will you walk in to see their gossiping

That's a question How shall we

try it

Nay then thus

We came into the world like brother and brother

And now let's go hand in hand not one before another
