


O my good lord why are you thus alone

For what offense have I this fortnight been

A banished woman from my Harry's bed

Tell me sweet lord what is 't that takes from thee

Thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep

Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth

And start so often when thou sit'st alone

Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks

And given my treasures and my rights of thee

To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy

In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched

And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars

Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed

Cry Courage To the field And thou hast talked

Of sallies and retires of trenches tents

Of palisadoes frontiers parapets

Of basilisks of cannon culverin

Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain

And all the currents of a heady fight

Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war

And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep

That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow

Like bubbles in a late-disturbd stream

And in thy face strange motions have appeared

Such as we see when men restrain their breath

On some great sudden hest O what portents are these

Some heavy business hath my lord in hand

And I must know it else he loves me not

But hear you my lord

What is it carries you away

Out you mad-headed ape

A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen

As you are tossed with In faith

I'll know your business Harry that I will

I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir

About his title and hath sent for you

To line his enterprise but if you go

Come come you paraquito answer me

Directly unto this question that I ask

In faith I'll break thy little finger Harry

An if thou wilt not tell me all things true

Do you not love me Do you not indeed

Well do not then for since you love me not

I will not love myself Do you not love me

Nay tell me if you speak in jest or no

How So far

It must of force

Go you giddy goose

Then should you be nothing but musical

for you are altogether governed by humors Lie

still you thief and hear the lady sing in Welsh

Wouldst thou have thy head broken

Then be still

Now God help thee

What's that

Not mine in good sooth

I will not sing
