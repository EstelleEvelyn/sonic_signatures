


To sing a song that old was sung

From ashes ancient Gower is come

Assuming man's infirmities

To glad your ear and please your eyes

It hath been sung at festivals

On ember eves and holy days

And lords and ladies in their lives

Have read it for restoratives

The purchase is to make men glorious

Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius

If you born in these latter times

When wit's more ripe accept my rhymes

And that to hear an old man sing

May to your wishes pleasure bring

I life would wish and that I might

Waste it for you like taper light

This Antioch then Antiochus the Great

Built up this city for his chiefest seat

The fairest in all Syria

I tell you what mine authors say

This king unto him took a peer

Who died and left a female heir

So buxom blithe and full of face

As heaven had lent her all his grace

With whom the father liking took

And her to incest did provoke

Bad child worse father To entice his own

To evil should be done by none

But custom what they did begin

Was with long use accounted no sin

The beauty of this sinful dame

Made many princes thither frame

To seek her as a bedfellow

In marriage pleasures playfellow

Which to prevent he made a law

To keep her still and men in awe

That whoso asked her for his wife

His riddle told not lost his life

So for her many a wight did die

As yon grim looks do testify

What now ensues to the judgment of your eye

I give my cause who best can justify

Here have you seen a mighty king

His child iwis to incest bring

A better prince and benign lord

That will prove awful both in deed and word

Be quiet then as men should be

Till he hath passed necessity

I'll show you those in troubles reign

Losing a mite a mountain gain

The good in conversation

To whom I give my benison

Is still at Tarsus where each man

Thinks all is Writ he speken can

And to remember what he does

Build his statue to make him glorious

But tidings to the contrary

Are brought your eyes What need speak I

Good Helicane that stayed at home

Not to eat honey like a drone

From others' labors for though he strive

To killen bad keep good alive

And to fulfill his prince' desire

Sends word of all that haps in Tyre

How Thaliard came full bent with sin

And had intent to murder him

And that in Tarsus was not best

Longer for him to make his rest

He doing so put forth to seas

Where when men been there's seldom ease

For now the wind begins to blow

Thunder above and deeps below

Makes such unquiet that the ship

Should house him safe is wracked and split

And he good prince having all lost

By waves from coast to coast is tossed

All perishen of man of pelf

Ne aught escapend but himself

Till Fortune tired with doing bad

Threw him ashore to give him glad

And here he comes What shall be next

Pardon old Gowerthis 'longs the text

Now sleep yslackd hath the rout

No din but snores about the house

Made louder by the o'erfed breast

Of this most pompous marriage feast

The cat with eyne of burning coal

Now couches from the mouse's hole

And crickets sing at the oven's mouth

Are the blither for their drouth

Hymen hath brought the bride to bed

Where by the loss of maidenhead

A babe is molded Be attent

And time that is so briefly spent

With your fine fancies quaintly eche

What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech

By many a dern and painful perch

Of Pericles the careful search

By the four opposing coigns

Which the world together joins

Is made with all due diligence

That horse and sail and high expense

Can stead the quest At last from Tyre

Fame answering the most strange enquire

To th' court of King Simonides

Are letters brought the tenor these

Antiochus and his daughter dead

The men of Tyrus on the head

Of Helicanus would set on

The crown of Tyre but he will none

The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress

Says to 'em if King Pericles

Come not home in twice six moons

He obedient to their dooms

Will take the crown The sum of this

Brought hither to Pentapolis

Y-ravishd the regions round

And everyone with claps can sound

Our heir apparent is a king

Who dreamt who thought of such a thing

Brief he must hence depart to Tyre

His queen with child makes her desire

Which who shall crossalong to go

Omit we all their dole and woe

Lychorida her nurse she takes

And so to sea Their vessel shakes

On Neptune's billow Half the flood

Hath their keel cut But Fortune moved

Varies again The grizzled North

Disgorges such a tempest forth

That as a duck for life that dives

So up and down the poor ship drives

The lady shrieks and well-anear

Does fall in travail with her fear

And what ensues in this fell storm

Shall for itself itself perform

I nill relate action may

Conveniently the rest convey

Which might not what by me is told

In your imagination hold

This stage the ship upon whose deck

The sea-tossed Pericles appears to speak

Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre

Welcomed and settled to his own desire

His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus

Unto Diana there 's a votaress

Now to Marina bend your mind

Whom our fast-growing scene must find

At Tarsus and by Cleon trained

In music letters who hath gained

Of education all the grace

Which makes high both the art and place

Of general wonder But alack

That monster envy oft the wrack

Of earnd praise Marina's life

Seeks to take off by treason's knife

And in this kind our Cleon hath

One daughter and a full grown wench

Even ripe for marriage rite This maid

Hight Philoten and it is said

For certain in our story she

Would ever with Marina be

Be 't when they weaved the sleided silk

With fingers long small white as milk

Or when she would with sharp needle wound

The cambric which she made more sound

By hurting it or when to the lute

She sung and made the night bird mute

That still records with moan or when

She would with rich and constant pen

Vail to her mistress Dian still

This Philoten contends in skill

With absolute Marina So

With the dove of Paphos might the crow

Vie feathers white Marina gets

All praises which are paid as debts

And not as given This so darks

In Philoten all graceful marks

That Cleon's wife with envy rare

A present murderer does prepare

For good Marina that her daughter

Might stand peerless by this slaughter

The sooner her vile thoughts to stead

Lychorida our nurse is dead

And cursd Dionyza hath

The pregnant instrument of wrath

Prest for this blow The unborn event

I do commend to your content

Only I carry wingd Time

Post on the lame feet of my rhyme

Which never could I so convey

Unless your thoughts went on my way

Dionyza does appear

With Leonine a murderer

Thus time we waste and long leagues make short

Sail seas in cockles have and wish but for 't

Making to take our imagination

From bourn to bourn region to region

By you being pardoned we commit no crime

To use one language in each several clime

Where our scenes seems to live I do beseech you

To learn of me who stand in the gaps to teach you

The stages of our story Pericles

Is now again thwarting the wayward seas

Attended on by many a lord and knight

To see his daughter all his life's delight

Old Helicanus goes along Behind

Is left to govern it you bear in mind

Old Escanes whom Helicanus late

Advanced in time to great and high estate

Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought

This king to Tarsusthink his pilot thought

So with his steerage shall your thoughts go on

To fetch his daughter home who first is gone

Like motes and shadows see them move awhile

Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile

See how belief may suffer by foul show

This borrowed passion stands for true old woe

And Pericles in sorrow all devoured

With sighs shot through and biggest tears o'ershowered

Leaves Tarsus and again embarks He swears

Never to wash his face nor cut his hairs

He puts on sackcloth and to sea He bears

A tempest which his mortal vessel tears

And yet he rides it out Now please you wit

The epitaph is for Marina writ

By wicked Dionyza

The fairest sweetest and best lies here

Who withered in her spring of year

She was of Tyrus the King's daughter

On whom foul death hath made this slaughter

Marina was she called and at her birth

Thetis being proud swallowed some part o' th' earth

Therefore the Earth fearing to be o'erflowed

Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestowed

Wherefore she doesand swears she'll never stint

Make raging battery upon shores of flint

No visor does become black villainy

So well as soft and tender flattery

Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead

And bear his courses to be orderd

By Lady Fortune while our scene must play

His daughter's woe and heavy welladay

In her unholy service Patience then

And think you now are all in Mytilene

Marina thus the brothel 'scapes and chances

Into an honest house our story says

She sings like one immortal and she dances

As goddesslike to her admird lays

Deep clerks she dumbs and with her neele composes

Nature's own shape of bud bird branch or berry

That even her art sisters the natural roses

Her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry

That pupils lacks she none of noble race

Who pour their bounty on her and her gain

She gives the cursd bawd Here we her place

And to her father turn our thoughts again

Where we left him on the sea We there him lost

Where driven before the winds he is arrived

Here where his daughter dwells and on this coast

Suppose him now at anchor The city strived

God Neptune's annual feast to keep from whence

Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies

His banners sable trimmed with rich expense

And to him in his barge with fervor hies

In your supposing once more put your sight

Of heavy Pericles Think this his bark

Where what is done in actionmore if might

Shall be discovered Please you sit and hark

Now our sands are almost run

More a little and then dumb

This my last boon give me

For such kindness must relieve me

That you aptly will suppose

What pageantry what feats what shows

What minstrelsy and pretty din

The regent made in Mytilene

To greet the King So he thrived

That he is promised to be wived

To fair Marina but in no wise

Till he had done his sacrifice

As Dian bade whereto being bound

The interim pray you all confound

In feathered briefness sails are filled

And wishes fall out as they're willed

At Ephesus the temple see

Our king and all his company

That he can hither come so soon

Is by your fancies' thankful doom

In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard

Of monstrous lust the due and just reward

In Pericles his queen and daughter seen

Although assailed with fortune fierce and keen

Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast

Led on by heaven and crowned with joy at last

In Helicanus may you well descry

A figure of truth of faith of loyalty

In reverend Cerimon there well appears

The worth that learnd charity aye wears

For wicked Cleon and his wife when fame

Had spread his cursd deed to the honored name

Of Pericles to rage the city turn

That him and his they in his palace burn

The gods for murder seemd so content

To punish although not done but meant

So on your patience evermore attending

New joy wait on you Here our play has ending
