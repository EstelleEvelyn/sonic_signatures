


A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,

incharitable dog!

I am out of patience.

Let’s take leave of him.

He receives comfort like

cold porridge.

Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit.

By and by it will strike.

One. Tell.

A dollar.

You have taken it wiselier than I meant you

should.

He will be talking.

The old cock.

Done. The wager?

A match!

So. You’re paid.

Yet—

Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly

delivered.

As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.

Of that there’s none, or little.

With an eye of green in ’t.

No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.

As many vouched rarities are.

Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.

’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper

well in our return.

What if he had said “widower Aeneas” too?

Good Lord, how you take it!

He hath raised the wall, and houses too.

I think he will carry this island home in his

pocket and give it his son for an apple.

Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,

That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,

But rather lose her to an African,

Where she at least is banished from your eye,

Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.

You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise

By all of us; and the fair soul herself

Weighed between loathness and obedience at

Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,

I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have

More widows in them of this business’ making

Than we bring men to comfort them.

The fault’s your own.

Very well.

Foul weather?

Or docks, or mallows.

Scape being drunk, for want of wine.

Yet he would be king on ’t.

No marrying ’mong his subjects?

’Save his Majesty!

An it had not fallen flatlong.

We would so, and then go a-batfowling.

Please you, sir,

Do not omit the heavy offer of it.

It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,

It is a comforter.

What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

Why

Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find

Not myself disposed to sleep.

What, art thou waking?

I do, and surely

It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st

Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?

This is a strange repose, to be asleep

With eyes wide open—standing, speaking, moving—

And yet so fast asleep.

Thou dost snore distinctly.

There’s meaning in thy snores.

Well, I am standing water.

Do so. To ebb

Hereditary sloth instructs me.

Prithee, say on.

The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim

A matter from thee, and a birth indeed

Which throes thee much to yield.

I have no hope

That he’s undrowned.

He’s gone.

Claribel.

What stuff is this? How say you?

’Tis true my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis,

So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions

There is some space.

Methinks I do.

I remember

You did supplant your brother Prospero.

But, for your conscience?

Thy case, dear friend,

Shall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan,

I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke

Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,

And I the King shall love thee.

O, but one word.

Whiles we stood here securing your repose,

Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing

Like bulls, or rather lions. Did ’t not wake you?

It struck mine ear most terribly.

The next advantage

Will we take throughly.

I say tonight. No more.

A living drollery! Now I will believe

That there are unicorns, that in Arabia

There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix

At this hour reigning there.

No matter, since

They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs.

Will ’t please you taste of what is here?

But one fiend at a time,

I’ll fight their legions o’er.

The devil speaks in him.

A most high miracle!

Ha, ha!

What things are these, my Lord Antonio?

Will money buy ’em?

He is drunk now. Where had he wine?

Why, how now, Stephano?

Or stole it, rather.
