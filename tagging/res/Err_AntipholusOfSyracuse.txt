


Go bear it to the Centaur where we host

And stay there Dromio till I come to thee

Within this hour it will be dinnertime

Till that I'll view the manners of the town

Peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings

And then return and sleep within mine inn

For with long travel I am stiff and weary

Get thee away

A trusty villain sir that very oft

When I am dull with care and melancholy

Lightens my humor with his merry jests

What will you walk with me about the town

And then go to my inn and dine with me

Farewell till then I will go lose myself

And wander up and down to view the city

He that commends me to mine own content

Commends me to the thing I cannot get

I to the world am like a drop of water

That in the ocean seeks another drop

Who falling there to find his fellow forth

Unseen inquisitive confounds himself

So I to find a mother and a brother

In quest of them unhappy lose myself

Here comes the almanac of my true date

What now How chance thou art returned so soon

Stop in your wind sir Tell me this I pray

Where have you left the money that I gave you

I am not in a sportive humor now

Tell me and dally not where is the money

We being strangers here how dar'st thou trust

So great a charge from thine own custody

Come Dromio come these jests are out of season

Reserve them till a merrier hour than this

Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee

Come on sir knave have done your foolishness

And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge

Now as I am a Christian answer me

In what safe place you have bestowed my money

Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours

That stands on tricks when I am undisposed

Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me

Thy mistress' marks What mistress slave hast thou

What wilt thou flout me thus unto my face

Being forbid There take you that sir knave

Upon my life by some device or other

The villain is o'erraught of all my money

They say this town is full of cozenage

As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye

Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind

Soul-killing witches that deform the body

Disguisd cheaters prating mountebanks

And many suchlike liberties of sin

If it prove so I will be gone the sooner

I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave

I greatly fear my money is not safe

The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up

Safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave

Is wandered forth in care to seek me out

By computation and mine host's report

I could not speak with Dromio since at first

I sent him from the mart See here he comes

How now sir Is your merry humor altered

As you love strokes so jest with me again

You know no Centaur You received no gold

Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner

My house was at the Phoenix Wast thou mad

That thus so madly thou didst answer me

Even now even here not half an hour since

Villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt

And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner

For which I hope thou felt'st I was displeased

Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth

Think'st thou I jest Hold take thou that and that

Because that I familiarly sometimes

Do use you for my fool and chat with you

Your sauciness will jest upon my love

And make a common of my serious hours

When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport

But creep in crannies when he hides his beams

If you will jest with me know my aspect

And fashion your demeanor to my looks

Or I will beat this method in your sconce

Dost thou not know

Shall I tell you why

Why first for flouting

me and then wherefore for urging it the second

time to me

Thank me sir for what

I'll make you amends next

to give you nothing for something But say sir is it

dinnertime

In good time sir what's

that

Well sir then 'twill be dry

Your reason

Well sir learn to jest in

good time There's a time for all things

By what rule sir

Let's hear it

May he not do it by fine and

recovery

Why is Time such a niggard

of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement

Why but there's many a

man hath more hair than wit

Why thou didst conclude

hairy men plain dealers without wit

For what reason

Nay not sound I pray you

Nay not sure in a thing

falsing

Name them

You would all this time

have proved there is no time for all things

But your reason was not

substantial why there is no time to recover

I knew 'twould be a bald

conclusion But soft who wafts us yonder

Plead you to me fair dame I know you not

In Ephesus I am but two hours old

As strange unto your town as to your talk

Who every word by all my wit being scanned

Wants wit in all one word to understand

By Dromio

Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman

What is the course and drift of your compact

Villain thou liest for even her very words

Didst thou deliver to me on the mart

How can she thus then call us by our names

Unless it be by inspiration

To me she speaks she moves me for her theme

What was I married to her in my dream

Or sleep I now and think I hear all this

What error drives our eyes and ears amiss

Until I know this sure uncertainty

I'll entertain the offered fallacy

I think thou art in mind and so am I

Thou hast thine own form

Am I in Earth in heaven or in hell

Sleeping or waking mad or well-advised

Known unto these and to myself disguised

I'll say as they say and persever so

And in this mist at all adventures go

Sweet mistresswhat your name is else I know not

Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine

Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not

Than our Earth's wonder more than Earth divine

Teach me dear creature how to think and speak

Lay open to my earthy gross conceit

Smothered in errors feeble shallow weak

The folded meaning of your words' deceit

Against my soul's pure truth why labor you

To make it wander in an unknown field

Are you a god Would you create me new

Transform me then and to your power I'll yield

But if that I am I then well I know

Your weeping sister is no wife of mine

Nor to her bed no homage do I owe

Far more far more to you do I decline

O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note

To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears

Sing Siren for thyself and I will dote

Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs

And as a bed I'll take them and there lie

And in that glorious supposition think

He gains by death that hath such means to die

Let love being light be drownd if she sink

Not mad but matedhow I do not know

For gazing on your beams fair sun being by

As good to wink sweet love as look on night

Thy sister's sister

No

It is thyself mine own self's better part

Mine eye's clear eye my dear heart's dearer heart

My food my fortune and my sweet hope's aim

My sole Earth's heaven and my heaven's claim

Call thyself sister sweet for I am thee

Thee will I love and with thee lead my life

Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife

Give me thy hand

Why how now Dromio

Where runn'st thou so fast

Thou art Dromio thou art

my man thou art thyself

What woman's man And

how besides thyself

What claim lays she to thee

What is she

How dost thou mean a fat

marriage

What complexion is she of

That's a fault that water will

mend

What's her name

Then she bears some

breadth

In what part of her body

stands Ireland

Where Scotland

Where France

Where England

Where Spain

Where America the Indies

Where stood Belgia the

Netherlands

Go hie thee presently Post to the road

An if the wind blow any way from shore

I will not harbor in this town tonight

If any bark put forth come to the mart

Where I will walk till thou return to me

If everyone knows us and we know none

'Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone

There's none but witches do inhabit here

And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence

She that doth call me husband even my soul

Doth for a wife abhor But her fair sister

Possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace

Of such enchanting presence and discourse

Hath almost made me traitor to myself

But lest myself be guilty to self wrong

I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song

Ay that's my name

What is your will that I shall do with this

Made it for me sir I bespoke it not

I pray you sir receive the money now

For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more

What I should think of this I cannot tell

But this I think there's no man is so vain

That would refuse so fair an offered chain

I see a man here needs not live by shifts

When in the streets he meets such golden gifts

I'll to the mart and there for Dromio stay

If any ship put out then straight away

There's not a man I meet but doth salute me

As if I were their well-acquainted friend

And everyone doth call me by my name

Some tender money to me some invite me

Some other give me thanks for kindnesses

Some offer me commodities to buy

Even now a tailor called me in his shop

And showed me silks that he had bought for me

And therewithal took measure of my body

Sure these are but imaginary wiles

And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here

What gold is this What Adam dost thou mean

I understand thee not

What thou mean'st an

officer

Well sir there rest in your

foolery Is there any ships puts forth tonight May

we be gone

The fellow is distract and so am I

And here we wander in illusions

Some blessd power deliver us from hence

Satan avoid I charge thee tempt me not

It is the devil

Why Dromio

Avoid then fiend What tell'st thou me of supping

Thou art as you are all a sorceress

I conjure thee to leave me and be gone

Avaunt thou witchCome Dromio let us go

I see these witches are afraid of swords

Come to the Centaur Fetch our stuff from thence

I long that we were safe and sound aboard

I will not stay tonight for all the town

Therefore away to get our stuff aboard

I think I had I never did deny it

Who heard me to deny it or forswear it

Thou art a villain to impeach me thus

I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty

Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand

Egeon art thou not or else his ghost

No sir not I I came from Syracuse

I gentle mistress

And so do I yet did she call me so

And this fair gentlewoman her sister here

Did call me brother What I told you then

I hope I shall have leisure to make good

If this be not a dream I see and hear

I think it be sir I deny it not

This purse of ducats I received from you

And Dromio my man did bring them me

I see we still did meet each other's man

And I was ta'en for him and he for me

And thereupon these errors are arose

He speaks to meI am your master Dromio

Come go with us We'll look to that anon

Embrace thy brother there Rejoice with him
