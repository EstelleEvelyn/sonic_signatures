your Worships’ company.

Will ’t please your Worship to come

in, sir?

The dinner attends you, sir.

I may not go in without your Worship. They will

not sit till you come.

I pray you, sir, walk in.

I think there are, sir. I heard them talked of.

Ay, indeed, sir.

Not I, sir. Pray you, keep on.

I pray you, sir.

Alas, how then?

Maybe he tells you true.

Gentle Master Fenton,

Yet seek my father’s love, still seek it, sir.

If opportunity and humblest suit

Cannot attain it, why then—hark you hither.

I come to him. This is my father’s choice.

O, what a world of vile ill-favored faults

Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!

Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

Now, Master Slender.

What is your will?

I mean, Master Slender, what would you with

me?

Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

Alas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth

And bowled to death with turnips!

Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
