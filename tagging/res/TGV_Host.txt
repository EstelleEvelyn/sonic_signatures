I pray you, why is it?

Come, we’ll have you merry. I’ll bring you where

you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you

asked for.

Ay, that you shall.

Hark, hark.

Ay. But peace; let’s hear ’em.

How now? Are you sadder than you were before?

How do you, man? The music likes you not.

Why, my pretty youth?

How, out of tune on the strings?

You have a quick ear.

I perceive you delight not in music.

Hark, what fine change is in the music!

You would have them always play but one

thing?

I tell you what Lance his man told me: he loved

her out of all nick.

Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his

master’s command, he must carry for a present to

his lady.

By my halidom, I was fast asleep.

Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think ’tis almost

day.
