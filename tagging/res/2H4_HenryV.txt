


Before God I am exceeding weary

Faith it does me though it discolors the complexion

of my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it

not show vilely in me to desire small beer

Belike then my appetite was not princely got

for by my troth I do now remember the poor

creature small beer But indeed these humble considerations

make me out of love with my greatness

What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name

or to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how

many pair of silk stockings thou hastwith these

and those that were thy peach-colored onesor to

bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity

and another for use But that the tennis-court

keeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb of

linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there

as thou hast not done a great while because the rest

of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy

holland and God knows whether those that bawl

out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit His kingdom

but the midwives say the children are not in the

fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds

are mightily strengthened

Shall I tell thee one thing Poins

It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding

than thine

Marry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be

sad now my father is sickalbeit I could tell to

thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to

call my friend I could be sad and sad indeed too

By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the

devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and

persistency Let the end try the man But I tell thee

my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick

and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in

reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow

What wouldst thou think of me if I should

weep

It would be every man's thought and thou art

a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks Never

a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway

better than thine Every man would think me an

hypocrite indeed And what accites your most worshipful

thought to think so

And to thee

And the boy that I gave Falstaff He had him

from me Christian and look if the fat villain have

not transformed him ape

And yours most noble Bardolph

Has not the boy profited

Instruct us boy What dream boy

A crown's worth of good interpretation There

'tis boy

And how doth thy master Bardolph

I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as

my dog and he holds his place for look you how he

writes

Nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it

from Japheth But to the letter Sir John

Falstaff knight to the son of the King nearest his

father Harry Prince of Wales greeting

Peace

I will imitate the honorable Romans in

brevity

I commend me to thee I commend thee

and I leave thee Be not too familiar with Poins for he

misuses thy favors so much that he swears thou art to

marry his sister Nell Repent at idle times as thou

mayst and so farewell

Thine by yea and no which is as much as

to say as thou usest him

Jack Falstaff with my familiars

John with my brothers and sisters and

Sir John with all Europe

That's to make him eat twenty of his words

But do you use me thus Ned Must I marry your

sister

Well thus we play the fools with the time and

the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us

Is your master here in London

Where sups he Doth the old boar feed in the

old frank

What company

Sup any women with him

What pagan may that be

Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the

town bullShall we steal upon them Ned at

supper

Sirrahyou boyand Bardolph no word to

your master that I am yet come to town There's for

your silence

Fare you well Go

This Doll Tearsheet should be some road

How might we see Falstaff bestow himself

tonight in his true colors and not ourselves be

seen

From a god to a bull a heavy descension It

was Jove's case From a prince to a 'prentice a low

transformation that shall be mine for in everything

the purpose must weigh with the folly Follow me

Ned

Would not this nave of a wheel

have his ears cut off

Look whe'er the withered elder hath not his

poll clawed like a parrot

Saturn and Venus this year in

conjunction What says th' almanac to that

Anon anon sir

Why thou globe of sinful continents what a

life dost thou lead

Very true sir and I come to draw you out by

the ears

You whoreson candle-mine you

how vilely did you speak of me even now before

this honest virtuous civil gentlewoman

Yea and you knew me as you did when you ran

away by Gad's Hill You knew I was at your back

and spoke it on purpose to try my patience

I shall drive you then to confess the wilfull

abuse and then I know how to handle you

Not to dispraise me and call me pantler and

bread-chipper and I know not what

See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice

doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman

to close with us Is she of the wicked is

thine hostess here of the wicked or is thy boy of the

wicked or honest Bardolph whose zeal burns in

his nose of the wicked

For the women

You gentlewoman

Peto how now what news

By heaven Poins I feel me much to blame

So idly to profane the precious time

When tempest of commotion like the south

Borne with black vapor doth begin to melt

And drop upon our bare unarmd heads

Give me my sword and cloakFalstaff good night

Who saw the Duke of Clarence

How now rain within doors and none abroad

How doth the King

Heard he the good news yet Tell it him

If he be sick with joy he'll recover without

physic

No I will sit and watch here by the King

Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow

Being so troublesome a bedfellow

O polished perturbation golden care

That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide

To many a watchful night Sleep with it now

Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet

As he whose brow with homely biggen bound

Snores out the watch of night O majesty

When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit

Like a rich armor worn in heat of day

That scald'st with safety By his gates of breath

There lies a downy feather which stirs not

Did he suspire that light and weightless down

Perforce must move My gracious lord my father

This sleep is sound indeed This is a sleep

That from this golden rigol hath divorced

So many English kings Thy due from me

Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood

Which nature love and filial tenderness

Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously

My due from thee is this imperial crown

Which as immediate from thy place and blood

Derives itself to me Lo where it sits

Which God shall guard And put the world's whole strength

Into one giant arm it shall not force

This lineal honor from me This from thee

Will I to mine leave as 'tis left to me

I never thought to hear you speak again

O pardon me my liege But for my tears

The moist impediments unto my speech

I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke

Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard

The course of it so far There is your crown

And He that wears the crown immortally

Long guard it yours If I affect it more

Than as your honor and as your renown

Let me no more from this obedience rise

Which my most inward true and duteous spirit

Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending

God witness with me when I here came in

And found no course of breath within your Majesty

How cold it struck my heart If I do feign

O let me in my present wildness die

And never live to show th' incredulous world

The noble change that I have purposd

Coming to look on you thinking you dead

And dead almost my liege to think you were

I spake unto this crown as having sense

And thus upbraided it The care on thee depending

Hath fed upon the body of my father

Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold

Other less fine in carat is more precious

Preserving life in med'cine potable

But thou most fine most honored most renowned

Hast eat thy bearer up Thus my most royal liege

Accusing it I put it on my head

To try with it as with an enemy

That had before my face murdered my father

The quarrel of a true inheritor

But if it did infect my blood with joy

Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride

If any rebel or vain spirit of mine

Did with the least affection of a welcome

Give entertainment to the might of it

Let God forever keep it from my head

And make me as the poorest vassal is

That doth with awe and terror kneel to it

My gracious liege

You won it wore it kept it gave it me

Then plain and right must my possession be

Which I with more than with a common pain

'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain

My Lord of Warwick

This new and gorgeous garment majesty

Sits not so easy on me as you think

Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear

This is the English not the Turkish court

Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds

But Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers

For by my faith it very well becomes you

Sorrow so royally in you appears

That I will deeply put the fashion on

And wear it in my heart Why then be sad

But entertain no more of it good brothers

Than a joint burden laid upon us all

For me by heaven I bid you be assured

I'll be your father and your brother too

Let me but bear your love I'll bear your cares

Yet weep that Harry's dead and so will I

But Harry lives that shall convert those tears

By number into hours of happiness

You all look strangely on me And you most

You are I think assured I love you not

No How might a prince of my great hopes forget

So great indignities you laid upon me

What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison

Th' immediate heir of England Was this easy

May this be washed in Lethe and forgotten

You are right justice and you weigh this well

Therefore still bear the balance and the sword

And I do wish your honors may increase

Till you do live to see a son of mine

Offend you and obey you as I did

So shall I live to speak my father's words

Happy am I that have a man so bold

That dares do justice on my proper son

And not less happy having such a son

That would deliver up his greatness so

Into the hands of justice You did commit me

For which I do commit into your hand

Th' unstaind sword that you have used to bear

With this remembrance that you use the same

With the like bold just and impartial spirit

As you have done 'gainst me There is my hand

You shall be as a father to my youth

My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear

And I will stoop and humble my intents

To your well-practiced wise directions

And princes all believe me I beseech you

My father is gone wild into his grave

For in his tomb lie my affections

And with his spirits sadly I survive

To mock the expectation of the world

To frustrate prophecies and to raze out

Rotten opinion who hath writ me down

After my seeming The tide of blood in me

Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now

Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea

Where it shall mingle with the state of floods

And flow henceforth in formal majesty

Now call we our high court of parliament

And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel

That the great body of our state may go

In equal rank with the best-governed nation

That war or peace or both at once may be

As things acquainted and familiar to us

In which you father shall have foremost hand

Our coronation done we will accite

As I before remembered all our state

And God consigning to my good intents

No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say

God shorten Harry's happy life one day

My Lord Chief Justice speak to that vain man

I know thee not old man Fall to thy prayers

How ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester

I have long dreamt of such a kind of man

So surfeit-swelled so old and so profane

But being awaked I do despise my dream

Make less thy body hence and more thy grace

Leave gormandizing Know the grave doth gape

For thee thrice wider than for other men

Reply not to me with a fool-born jest

Presume not that I am the thing I was

For God doth knowso shall the world perceive

That I have turned away my former self

So will I those that kept me company

When thou dost hear I am as I have been

Approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast

The tutor and the feeder of my riots

Till then I banish thee on pain of death

As I have done the rest of my misleaders

Not to come near our person by ten mile

For competence of life I will allow you

That lack of means enforce you not to evils

And as we hear you do reform yourselves

We will according to your strengths and qualities

Give you advancement Be it your charge my lord

To see performed the tenor of my word

Set on
