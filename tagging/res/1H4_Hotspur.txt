


My liege I did deny no prisoners

But I remember when the fight was done

When I was dry with rage and extreme toil

Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword

Came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressed

Fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped

Showed like a stubble land at harvest home

He was perfumd like a milliner

And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held

A pouncet box which ever and anon

He gave his nose and took 't away again

Who therewith angry when it next came there

Took it in snuff and still he smiled and talked

And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by

He called them untaught knaves unmannerly

To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse

Betwixt the wind and his nobility

With many holiday and lady terms

He questioned me amongst the rest demanded

My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf

I then all smarting with my wounds being cold

To be so pestered with a popinjay

Out of my grief and my impatience

Answered neglectingly I know not what

He should or he should not for he made me mad

To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet

And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

Of guns and drums and woundsGod save the mark

And telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth

Was parmacety for an inward bruise

And that it was great pity so it was

This villainous saltpeter should be digged

Out of the bowels of the harmless Earth

Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed

So cowardly and but for these vile guns

He would himself have been a soldier

This bald unjointed chat of his my lord

I answered indirectly as I said

And I beseech you let not his report

Come current for an accusation

Betwixt my love and your high Majesty

Revolted Mortimer

He never did fall off my sovereign liege

But by the chance of war To prove that true

Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds

Those mouthd wounds which valiantly he took

When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank

In single opposition hand to hand

He did confound the best part of an hour

In changing hardiment with great Glendower

Three times they breathed and three times did they drink

Upon agreement of swift Severn's flood

Who then affrighted with their bloody looks

Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds

And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank

Blood-staind with these valiant combatants

Never did bare and rotten policy

Color her working with such deadly wounds

Nor never could the noble Mortimer

Receive so many and all willingly

Then let not him be slandered with revolt

An if the devil come and roar for them

I will not send them I will after straight

And tell him so for I will ease my heart

Albeit I make a hazard of my head

Speak of Mortimer

Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul

Want mercy if I do not join with him

Yea on his part I'll empty all these veins

And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust

But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer

As high in the air as this unthankful king

As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke

He will forsooth have all my prisoners

And when I urged the ransom once again

Of my wife's brother then his cheek looked pale

And on my face he turned an eye of death

Trembling even at the name of Mortimer

But soft I pray you Did King Richard then

Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer

Heir to the crown

Nay then I cannot blame his cousin king

That wished him on the barren mountains starve

But shall it be that you that set the crown

Upon the head of this forgetful man

And for his sake wear the detested blot

Of murderous subornationshall it be

That you a world of curses undergo

Being the agents or base second means

The cords the ladder or the hangman rather

O pardon me that I descend so low

To show the line and the predicament

Wherein you range under this subtle king

Shall it for shame be spoken in these days

Or fill up chronicles in time to come

That men of your nobility and power

Did gage them both in an unjust behalf

As both of you God pardon it have done

To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose

And plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke

And shall it in more shame be further spoken

That you are fooled discarded and shook off

By him for whom these shames you underwent

No yet time serves wherein you may redeem

Your banished honors and restore yourselves

Into the good thoughts of the world again

Revenge the jeering and disdained contempt

Of this proud king who studies day and night

To answer all the debt he owes to you

Even with the bloody payment of your deaths

Therefore I say

If he fall in good night or sink or swim

Send danger from the east unto the west

So honor cross it from the north to south

And let them grapple O the blood more stirs

To rouse a lion than to start a hare

By heaven methinks it were an easy leap

To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon

Or dive into the bottom of the deep

Where fathom line could never touch the ground

And pluck up drownd honor by the locks

So he that doth redeem her thence might wear

Without corrival all her dignities

But out upon this half-faced fellowship

I cry you mercy

I'll keep them all

By God he shall not have a Scot of them

No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not

I'll keep them by this hand

Nay I will That's flat

He said he would not ransom Mortimer

Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer

But I will find him when he lies asleep

And in his ear I'll hollo Mortimer

Nay I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak

Nothing but Mortimer and give it him

To keep his anger still in motion

All studies here I solemnly defy

Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke

And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales

But that I think his father loves him not

And would be glad he met with some mischance

I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale

Why look you I am whipped and scourged with rods

Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear

Of this vile politician Bolingbroke

In Richard's timewhat do you call the place

A plague upon it It is in Gloucestershire

'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept

His uncle York where I first bowed my knee

Unto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke

'Sblood when you and he came back from Ravenspurgh

You say true

Why what a candy deal of courtesy

This fawning greyhound then did proffer me

Look when his infant fortune came to age

And gentle Harry Percy and kind cousin

O the devil take such cozenersGod forgive me

Good uncle tell your tale I have done

I have done i' faith

Of York is it not

I smell it Upon my life it will do well

Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot

And then the power of Scotland and of York

To join with Mortimer ha

In faith it is exceedingly well aimed

He does he does We'll be revenged on him

Uncle adieu O let the hours be short

Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport

But for mine own part my lord I could be

well contented to be there in respect of the love I

bear your house He could be contented why is he

not then In respect of the love he bears our

househe shows in this he loves his own barn

better than he loves our house Let me see some

more The purpose you undertake is dangerous

Why that's certain 'Tis dangerous to take a cold

to sleep to drink but I tell you my Lord Fool out

of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety

The purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends

you have named uncertain the time itself unsorted

and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise

of so great an opposition Say you so say you so

I say unto you again you are a shallow cowardly

hind and you lie What a lack-brain is this By

the Lord our plot is a good plot as ever was laid

our friends true and constanta good plot

good friends and full of expectation an excellent

plot very good friends What a frosty-spirited

rogue is this Why my Lord of York commends

the plot and the general course of the action

Zounds an I were now by this rascal I could brain

him with his lady's fan Is there not my father my

uncle and myself Lord Edmund Mortimer my

Lord of York and Owen Glendower Is there not

besides the Douglas Have I not all their letters to

meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month

and are they not some of them set forward already

What a pagan rascal is thisan infidel Ha you

shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold

heart will he to the King and lay open all our

proceedings O I could divide myself and go to

buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so

honorable an action Hang him let him tell the

King We are prepared I will set forward tonight

How now Kate I must leave you within these two

hours

What ho    Is Gilliams with the packet gone

Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff

What horse A roan a crop-ear is it not

That roan shall be my throne

Well I will back him straight O Esperance

Bid Butler lead him forth into the park

What say'st thou my lady

Why my horse my love my horse

So far afoot I shall be weary love

Away

Away you trifler Love I love thee not

I care not for thee Kate This is no world

To play with mammets and to tilt with lips

We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns

And pass them current tooGods me my horse

What say'st thou Kate What wouldst thou have with me

Come wilt thou see me ride

And when I am a-horseback I will swear

I love thee infinitely But hark you Kate

I must not have you henceforth question me

Whither I go nor reason whereabout

Whither I must I must and to conclude

This evening must I leave you gentle Kate

I know you wise but yet no farther wise

Than Harry Percy's wife constant you are

But yet a woman and for secrecy

No lady closer for I well believe

Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know

And so far will I trust thee gentle Kate

Not an inch further But hark you Kate

Whither I go thither shall you go too

Today will I set forth tomorrow you

Will this content you Kate

Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower

Will you sit down And uncle Worcester

A plague upon it I have forgot the map

And you in hell

As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of

Why so it would have done

At the same season if your mother's cat

Had but kittened though yourself had never been born

And I say the Earth was not of my mind

If you suppose as fearing you it shook

O then the Earth shook to see the heavens on fire

And not in fear of your nativity

Diseasd nature oftentimes breaks forth

In strange eruptions oft the teeming Earth

Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed

By the imprisoning of unruly wind

Within her womb which for enlargement striving

Shakes the old beldam Earth and topples down

Steeples and moss-grown towers At your birth

Our grandam Earth having this distemp'rature

In passion shook

I think there's no man speaks better Welsh

I'll to dinner

Why so can I or so can any man

But will they come when you do call for them

And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil

By telling truth Tell truth and shame the devil

If thou have power to raise him bring him hither

And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence

O while you live tell truth and shame the devil

Home without boots and in foul weather too

How 'scapes he agues in the devil's name

Methinks my moiety north from Burton here

In quantity equals not one of yours

See how this river comes me cranking in

And cuts me from the best of all my land

A huge half-moon a monstrous cantle out

I'll have the current in this place dammed up

And here the smug and silver Trent shall run

In a new channel fair and evenly

It shall not wind with such a deep indent

To rob me of so rich a bottom here

I'll have it so A little charge will do it

Will not you

Who shall say me nay

Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh

Marry and I am glad of it with all my heart

I had rather be a kitten and cry mew

Than one of these same meter balladmongers

I had rather hear a brazen can'stick turned

Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree

And that would set my teeth nothing an edge

Nothing so much as mincing poetry

'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag

I do not care I'll give thrice so much land

To any well-deserving friend

But in the way of bargain mark you me

I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair

Are the indentures drawn Shall we be gone

I cannot choose Sometime he angers me

With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant

Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies

And of a dragon and a finless fish

A clip-winged griffin and a moulten raven

A couching lion and a ramping cat

And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff

As puts me from my faith I tell you what

He held me last night at least nine hours

In reckoning up the several devils' names

That were his lackeys I cried Hum and Well go to

But marked him not a word O he is as tedious

As a tired horse a railing wife

Worse than a smoky house I had rather live

With cheese and garlic in a windmill far

Than feed on cates and have him talk to me

In any summer house in Christendom

Well I am schooled Good manners be your speed

Here come our wives and let us take our leave

Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down

Come quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lap

Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh

And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous

By 'r Lady he is a good musician

I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in

Irish

No

Neither 'tis a woman's fault

To the Welsh lady's bed

Peace she sings

Come Kate I'll have your song too

Not yours in good sooth Heart you swear

like a comfit-maker's wife Not you in good

sooth and as true as I live and as God shall

mend me and as sure as day

And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths

As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury

Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art

A good mouth-filling oath and leave in sooth

And such protest of pepper-gingerbread

To velvet-guards and Sunday citizens

Come sing

'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast

teacher An the indentures be drawn I'll

away within these two hours and so come in when

you will

Well said my noble Scot If speaking truth

In this fine age were not thought flattery

Such attribution should the Douglas have

As not a soldier of this season's stamp

Should go so general current through the world

By God I cannot flatter I do defy

The tongues of soothers But a braver place

In my heart's love hath no man than yourself

Nay task me to my word approve me lord

Do so and 'tis well

What letters hast thou there I can but thank you

Letters from him Why comes he not himself

Zounds how has he the leisure to be sick

In such a justling time Who leads his power

Under whose government come they along

Sick now Droop now This sickness doth infect

The very lifeblood of our enterprise

'Tis catching hither even to our camp

He writes me here that inward sickness

And that his friends by deputation

Could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet

To lay so dangerous and dear a trust

On any soul removed but on his own

Yet doth he give us bold advertisement

That with our small conjunction we should on

To see how fortune is disposed to us

For as he writes there is no quailing now

Because the King is certainly possessed

Of all our purposes What say you to it

A perilous gash a very limb lopped off

And yet in faith it is not His present want

Seems more than we shall find it Were it good

To set the exact wealth of all our states

All at one cast To set so rich a main

On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour

It were not good for therein should we read

The very bottom and the soul of hope

The very list the very utmost bound

Of all our fortunes

A rendezvous a home to fly unto

If that the devil and mischance look big

Upon the maidenhead of our affairs

You strain too far

I rather of his absence make this use

It lends a luster and more great opinion

A larger dare to our great enterprise

Than if the Earl were here for men must think

If we without his help can make a head

To push against a kingdom with his help

We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down

Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole

My cousin Vernon welcome by my soul

No harm what more

He shall be welcome too Where is his son

The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales

And his comrades that daffed the world aside

And bid it pass

No more no more Worse than the sun in March

This praise doth nourish agues Let them come

They come like sacrifices in their trim

And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war

All hot and bleeding will we offer them

The maild Mars shall on his altar sit

Up to the ears in blood I am on fire

To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh

And yet not ours Come let me taste my horse

Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt

Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales

Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse

Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse

O that Glendower were come

What may the King's whole battle reach unto

Forty let it be

My father and Glendower being both away

The powers of us may serve so great a day

Come let us take a muster speedily

Doomsday is near Die all die merrily

We'll fight with him tonight

Why say you so Looks he not for supply

His is certain ours is doubtful

Tonight say I

So are the horses of the enemy

In general journey-bated and brought low

The better part of ours are full of rest

Welcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God

You were of our determination

Some of us love you well and even those some

Envy your great deservings and good name

Because you are not of our quality

But stand against us like an enemy

The King is kind and well we know the King

Knows at what time to promise when to pay

My father and my uncle and myself

Did give him that same royalty he wears

And when he was not six-and-twenty strong

Sick in the world's regard wretched and low

A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home

My father gave him welcome to the shore

And when he heard him swear and vow to God

He came but to be Duke of Lancaster

To sue his livery and beg his peace

With tears of innocency and terms of zeal

My father in kind heart and pity moved

Swore him assistance and performed it too

Now when the lords and barons of the realm

Perceived Northumberland did lean to him

The more and less came in with cap and knee

Met him in boroughs cities villages

Attended him on bridges stood in lanes

Laid gifts before him proffered him their oaths

Gave him their heirs as pages followed him

Even at the heels in golden multitudes

He presently as greatness knows itself

Steps me a little higher than his vow

Made to my father while his blood was poor

Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh

And now forsooth takes on him to reform

Some certain edicts and some strait decrees

That lie too heavy on the commonwealth

Cries out upon abuses seems to weep

Over his country's wrongs and by this face

This seeming brow of justice did he win

The hearts of all that he did angle for

Proceeded furthercut me off the heads

Of all the favorites that the absent king

In deputation left behind him here

When he was personal in the Irish war

Then to the point

In short time after he deposed the King

Soon after that deprived him of his life

And in the neck of that tasked the whole state

To make that worse suffered his kinsman March

Who is if every owner were well placed

Indeed his king to be engaged in Wales

There without ransom to lie forfeited

Disgraced me in my happy victories

Sought to entrap me by intelligence

Rated mine uncle from the council board

In rage dismissed my father from the court

Broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong

And in conclusion drove us to seek out

This head of safety and withal to pry

Into his title the which we find

Too indirect for long continuance

Not so Sir Walter We'll withdraw awhile

Go to the King and let there be impawned

Some surety for a safe return again

And in the morning early shall mine uncle

Bring him our purposes And so farewell

And maybe so we shall

My uncle is returned

Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland

Uncle what news

Lord Douglas go you and tell him so

Did you beg any God forbid

O would the quarrel lay upon our heads

And that no man might draw short breath today

But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me

How showed his tasking Seemed it in contempt

Cousin I think thou art enamord

On his follies Never did I hear

Of any prince so wild a liberty

But be he as he will yet once ere night

I will embrace him with a soldier's arm

That he shall shrink under my courtesy

Arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends

Better consider what you have to do

Than I that have not well the gift of tongue

Can lift your blood up with persuasion

I cannot read them now

O gentlemen the time of life is short

To spend that shortness basely were too long

If life did ride upon a dial's point

Still ending at the arrival of an hour

An if we live we live to tread on kings

If die brave death when princes die with us

Now for our consciences the arms are fair

When the intent of bearing them is just

I thank him that he cuts me from my tale

For I profess not talking Only this

Let each man do his best And here draw I a sword

Whose temper I intend to stain

With the best blood that I can meet withal

In the adventure of this perilous day

Now Esperance Percy And set on

Sound all the lofty instruments of war

And by that music let us all embrace

For heaven to Earth some of us never shall

A second time do such a courtesy

O Douglas hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus

I never had triumphed upon a Scot

Where

This Douglas No I know this face full well

A gallant knight he was his name was Blunt

Semblably furnished like the King himself

The King hath many marching in his coats

Up and away

Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day

If I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouth

My name is Harry Percy

Nor shall it Harry for the hour is come

To end the one of us and would to God

Thy name in arms were now as great as mine

I can no longer brook thy vanities

O Harry thou hast robbed me of my youth

I better brook the loss of brittle life

Than those proud titles thou hast won of me

They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh

But thoughts the slaves of life and life time's fool

And time that takes survey of all the world

Must have a stop O I could prophesy

But that the earthy and cold hand of death

Lies on my tongue No Percy thou art dust

And food for
