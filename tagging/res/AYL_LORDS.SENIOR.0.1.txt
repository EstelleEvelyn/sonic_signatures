
Indeed, my lord,

The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,

And in that kind swears you do more usurp

Than doth your brother that hath banished you.

Today my Lord of Amiens and myself

Did steal behind him as he lay along

Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out

Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;

To the which place a poor sequestered stag

That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt

Did come to languish. And indeed, my lord,

The wretched animal heaved forth such groans

That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat

Almost to bursting, and the big round tears

Coursed one another down his innocent nose

In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,

Much markèd of the melancholy Jaques,

Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,

Augmenting it with tears.

O yes, into a thousand similes.

First, for his weeping into the needless stream:

“Poor deer,” quoth he, “thou mak’st a testament

As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more

To that which had too much.” Then, being there alone,

Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:

“’Tis right,” quoth he. “Thus misery doth part

The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,

Full of the pasture, jumps along by him

And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,

“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens.

’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look

Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”

Thus most invectively he pierceth through

The body of country, city, court,

Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we

Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,

To fright the animals and to kill them up

In their assigned and native dwelling place.

I’ll bring you to him straight.

Who doth ambition shun

And loves to live i’ th’ sun,

Seeking the food he eats

And pleased with what he gets,

Come hither, come hither, come hither.

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.

My lord, he is but even now gone hence.

Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

He saves my labor by his own approach.

Sir, it was I.
