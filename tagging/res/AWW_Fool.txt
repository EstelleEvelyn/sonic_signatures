'Tis not unknown to you madam I am a poor

fellow

No madam 'tis not so well that I am poor

though many of the rich are damned But if I may

have your Ladyship's good will to go to the world

Isbel the woman and I will do as we may

I do beg your good will in this case

In Isbel's case and mine own Service is no heritage

and I think I shall never have the blessing of

God till I have issue o' my body for they say bairns

are blessings

My poor body madam requires it I am driven

on by the flesh and he must needs go that the devil

drives

Faith madam I have other holy reasons such

as they are

I have been madam a wicked creature as you

and all flesh and blood are and indeed I do marry

that I may repent

I am out o' friends madam and I hope to have

friends for my wife's sake

You're shallow madam in great friends for the

knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary

of He that ears my land spares my team and gives

me leave to in the crop if I be his cuckold he's my

drudge He that comforts my wife is the cherisher

of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh

and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves

my flesh and blood is my friend Ergo he that

kisses my wife is my friend If men could be contented

to be what they are there were no fear in

marriage for young Charbon the Puritan and old

Poysam the Papist howsome'er their hearts are

severed in religion their heads are both one they

may jowl horns together like any deer i' th' herd

A prophet I madam and I speak the truth the

next way

For I the ballad will repeat

Which men full true shall find

Your marriage comes by destiny

Your cuckoo sings by kind

Was this fair face the cause quoth she

Why the Grecians sackd Troy

Fond done done fond

Was this King Priam's joy

With that she sighd as she stood

With that she sighd as she stood

And gave this sentence then

Among nine bad if one be good

Among nine bad if one be good

There's yet one good in ten

One good woman in ten madam which is a

purifying o' th' song Would God would serve the

world so all the year We'd find no fault with the

tithe-woman if I were the parson One in ten

quoth he An we might have a good woman born

but or every blazing star or at an earthquake

'twould mend the lottery well A man may draw his

heart out ere he pluck one

That man should be at woman's command and

yet no hurt done Though honesty be no Puritan

yet it will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of

humility over the black gown of a big heart I am

going forsooth The business is for Helen to come

hither

I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught I

know my business is but to the court

Truly madam if God have lent a man any manners

he may easily put it off at court He that cannot

make a leg put off 's cap kiss his hand and

say nothing has neither leg hands lip nor cap

and indeed such a fellow to say precisely were

not for the court But for me I have an answer

will serve all men

It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks

the pin-buttock the quatch-buttock the brawn-buttock

or any buttock

As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney

as your French crown for your taffety punk as

Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger as a pancake for

Shrove Tuesday a morris for May Day as the nail

to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding

quean to a wrangling knave as the nun's lip to the

friar's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin

From below your duke to beneath your constable

it will fit any question

But a trifle neither in good faith if the learned

should speak truth of it Here it is and all that

belongs to 't Ask me if I am a courtier it shall do

you no harm to learn

O Lord sirThere's a simple putting off More

more a hundred of them

O Lord sirThick thick Spare not me

O Lord sirNay put me to 't I warrant you

O Lord sirSpare not me

I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my O Lord

sir I see things may serve long but not serve ever

O Lord sirWhy there 't serves well again

Not much commendation to them

Most fruitfully I am there before my legs

She is not well but yet she has her health She's

very merry but yet she is not well But thanks be

given she's very well and wants nothing i' th' world

but yet she is not well

Truly she's very well indeed but for two things

One that she's not in heaven whither God send

her quickly the other that she's in Earth from

whence God send her quickly

So that you had her wrinkles and I her money I

would she did as you say

Marry you are the wiser man for many a man's

tongue shakes out his master's undoing To say

nothing to do nothing to know nothing and to

have nothing is to be a great part of your title

which is within a very little of nothing

You should have said sir Before a knave

thou 'rt a knave that's Before me thou 'rt a

knave This had been truth sir

Did you find me in yourself sir or were you

taught to find me

The search sir was profitable and much fool

may you find in you even to the world's pleasure

and the increase of laughter

By my troth I take my young lord to be a very

melancholy man

Why he will look upon his boot and sing mend

the ruff and sing ask questions and sing pick his

teeth and sing I know a man that had this trick of

melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song

I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court Our

old lings and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing

like your old ling and your Isbels o' th' court The

brains of my Cupid's knocked out and I begin to

love as an old man loves money with no stomach

E'en that you have there

O madam yonder is heavy news within between

two soldiers and my young lady

Nay there is some comfort in the news some

comfort Your son will not be killed so soon as I

thought he would

So say I madam if he run away as I hear he

does The danger is in standing to 't that's the loss

of men though it be the getting of children Here

they come will tell you more For my part I only

hear your son was run away

Indeed sir she was the sweet marjoram of the

salad or rather the herb of grace

I am no great Nebuchadnezzar sir I have not

much skill in grass

A fool sir at a woman's service and a knave at a

man's

I would cozen the man of his wife and do his

service

And I would give his wife my bauble sir to do

her service

At your service

Why sir if I cannot serve you I can serve as

great a prince as you are

Faith sir he has an English name but his

phys'nomy is more hotter in France than there

The black prince sir alias the prince of darkness

alias the devil

I am a woodland fellow sir that always loved a

great fire and the master I speak of ever keeps a

good fire But sure he is the prince of the world let

his Nobility remain in 's court I am for the house

with the narrow gate which I take to be too little

for pomp to enter Some that humble themselves

may but the many will be too chill and tender and

they'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the

broad gate and the great fire

If I put any tricks upon 'em sir they shall be

jades' tricks which are their own right by the law

of nature

O madam yonder's my lord your son with a

patch of velvet on 's face Whether there be a scar

under 't or no the velvet knows but 'tis a goodly

patch of velvet His left cheek is a cheek of two pile

and a half but his right cheek is worn bare

But it is your carbonadoed face

'Faith there's a dozen of 'em with delicate fine

hats and most courteous feathers which bow the

head and nod at every man

Truly Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it

smell so strongly as thou speak'st of I will henceforth

eat no fish of Fortune's butt'ring Prithee

allow the wind

Indeed sir if your metaphor stink I will stop my

nose or against any man's metaphor Prithee get

thee further

Foh Prithee stand away A paper from Fortune's

close-stool to give to a nobleman

Look here he comes himselfHere is a purr of

Fortune's sir or of Fortune's catbut not a

musk-catthat has fall'n into the unclean fishpond

of her displeasure and as he says is muddied

withal Pray you sir use the carp as you may

for he looks like a poor decayed ingenious foolish

rascally knave I do pity his distress in my

smiles of comfort and leave him to your Lordship
