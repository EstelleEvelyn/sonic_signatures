Bloody 'Tis necessary he should die

Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy

Now captain

You undergo too strict a paradox

Striving to make an ugly deed look fair

Your words have took such pains as if they labored

To bring manslaughter into form and set quarreling

Upon the head of valorwhich indeed

Is valor misbegot and came into the world

When sects and factions were newly born

He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer

The worst that man can breathe

And make his wrongs his outsides

To wear them like his raiment carelessly

And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart

To bring it into danger

If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill

What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill

You cannot make gross sins look clear

To revenge is no valor but to bear

What's that

He dies

We are for law He dies Urge it no more

On height of our displeasure Friend or brother

He forfeits his own blood that spills another

Do you dare our anger

'Tis in few words but spacious in effect

We banish thee forever

If after two days' shine Athens contain thee

Attend our weightier judgment

And not to swell our spirit

He shall be executed presently
