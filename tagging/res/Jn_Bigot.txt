


Tomorrow morning let us meet him then

Or when he doomed this beauty to a grave

Found it too precious-princely for a grave

Our souls religiously confirm thy words

Out dunghill Dar'st thou brave a nobleman

What wilt thou do renownd Faulconbridge

Second a villain and a murderer

Who killed this prince

Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there
