


How far is 't called to ForresWhat are these

So withered and so wild in their attire

That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' Earth

And yet are on 'tLive you Or are you aught

That man may question You seem to understand me

By each at once her choppy finger laying

Upon her skinny lips You should be women

And yet your beards forbid me to interpret

That you are so

Good sir why do you start and seem to fear

Things that do sound so fairI' th' name of truth

Are you fantastical or that indeed

Which outwardly you show My noble partner

You greet with present grace and great prediction

Of noble having and of royal hope

That he seems rapt withal To me you speak not

If you can look into the seeds of time

And say which grain will grow and which will not

Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear

Your favors nor your hate

The earth hath bubbles as the water has

And these are of them Whither are they vanished

Were such things here as we do speak about

Or have we eaten on the insane root

That takes the reason prisoner

You shall be king

To th' selfsame tune and wordsWho's here

What can the devil speak true

That trusted home

Might yet enkindle you unto the crown

Besides the Thane of Cawdor But 'tis strange

And oftentimes to win us to our harm

The instruments of darkness tell us truths

Win us with honest trifles to betray 's

In deepest consequence

Cousins a word I pray you

Look how our partner's rapt

New honors come upon him

Like our strange garments cleave not to their mold

But with the aid of use

Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure

Very gladly

There if I grow

The harvest is your own

This guest of summer

The temple-haunting martlet does approve

By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath

Smells wooingly here No jutty frieze

Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird

Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle

Where they most breed and haunt I have observed

The air is delicate

How goes the night boy

And she goes down at twelve

Hold take my sword There's husbandry in heaven

Their candles are all out Take thee that too

A heavy summons lies like lead upon me

And yet I would not sleep Merciful powers

Restrain in me the cursd thoughts that nature

Gives way to in repose    Give me my swordWho's there

What sir not yet at rest The King's abed

He hath been in unusual pleasure and

Sent forth great largess to your offices

This diamond he greets your wife withal

By the name of most kind hostess and shut up

In measureless content

All's well

I dreamt last night of the three Werd Sisters

To you they have showed some truth

At your kind'st leisure

So I lose none

In seeking to augment it but still keep

My bosom franchised and allegiance clear

I shall be counseled

Thanks sir The like to you

Too cruel anywhere

Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself

And say it is not so

Look to the lady

And when we have our naked frailties hid

That suffer in exposure let us meet

And question this most bloody piece of work

To know it further Fears and scruples shake us

In the great hand of God I stand and thence

Against the undivulged pretense I fight

Of treasonous malice

Well contented

Thou hast it nowking Cawdor Glamis all

As the Werd Women promised and I fear

Thou played'st most foully for 't Yet it was said

It should not stand in thy posterity

But that myself should be the root and father

Of many kings If there come truth from them

As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine

Why by the verities on thee made good

May they not be my oracles as well

And set me up in hope But hush no more

Let your Highness

Command upon me to the which my duties

Are with a most indissoluble tie

Forever knit

Ay my good lord

As far my lord as will fill up the time

'Twixt this and supper Go not my horse the better

I must become a borrower of the night

For a dark hour or twain

My lord I will not

Ay my good lord Our time does call upon 's

Give us a light there ho

It will be rain tonight

O treachery Fly good Fleance fly fly fly

Thou mayst revengeO slave
