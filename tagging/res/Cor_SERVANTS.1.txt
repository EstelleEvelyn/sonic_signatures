


Wine wine wine What service is

here I think our fellows are asleep

What would you have friend

Whence are you Here's no place for you Pray go

to the door

A strange one as ever I looked on I

cannot get him out o' th' house Prithee call my

master to him

Here's a strange alteration

What an arm he has He turned me

about with his finger and his thumb as one would

set up a top

He had so looking as it were

Would I were hanged but I thought there was

more in him than I could think

I think he is But a greater soldier

than he you wot one

Nay it's no matter for that

Nay not so neither But I take him

to be the greater soldier

Ay and for an assault too

What what what Let's partake

Wherefore Wherefore

Why do you say thwack our

general

He was too hard for him directly to

say the truth on 't before Corioles he scotched

him and notched him like a carbonado

But more of thy news

Directitude What's that

But when goes this forward

Let me have war say I It exceeds

peace as far as day does night It's sprightly walking

audible and full of vent Peace is a very apoplexy

lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter

of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of

men

Ay and it makes men hate one

another

In in in in
