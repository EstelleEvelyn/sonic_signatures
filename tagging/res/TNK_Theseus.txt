


Sad lady rise

What's your request Deliver you for all

Pray you kneel not

I was transported with your speech and suffered

Your knees to wrong themselves I have heard the fortunes

Of your dead lords which gives me such lamenting

As wakes my vengeance and revenge for 'em

King Capaneus was your lord The day

That he should marry you at such a season

As now it is with me I met your groom

By Mars's altar You were that time fair

Not Juno's mantle fairer than your tresses

Nor in more bounty spread her Your wheaten wreath

Was then nor threshed nor blasted Fortune at you

Dimpled her cheek with smiles Hercules our kinsman

Then weaker than your eyes laid by his club

He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide

And swore his sinews thawed O grief and time

Fearful consumers you will all devour

O no knees none widow

Unto the helmeted Bellona use them

And pray for me your soldier

Troubled I am

Forward to th' temple Leave not out a jot

O' th' sacred ceremony

It is true and I will give you comfort

To give your dead lords graves

The which to do must make some work with Creon

Artesius that best knowest

How to draw out fit to this enterprise

The prim'st for this proceeding and the number

To carry such a business forth and levy

Our worthiest instruments whilst we dispatch

This grand act of our life this daring deed

Of fate in wedlock

Why good ladies

This is a service whereto I am going

Greater than any was it more imports me

Than all the actions that I have foregone

Or futurely can cope

Pray stand up

I am entreating of myself to do

That which you kneel to have mePirithous

Lead on the bride get you and pray the gods

For success and return omit not anything

In the pretended celebrationQueens

Follow your soldier As before hence you

And at the banks of Aulis meet us with

The forces you can raise where we shall find

The moiety of a number for a business

More bigger looked Since that our theme is haste

I stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip

Sweet keep it as my tokenSet you forward

For I will see you gone

Farewell my beauteous sisterPirithous

Keep the feast full bate not an hour on 't

Cousin I charge you

Budge not from Athens We shall be returning

Ere you can end this feast of which I pray you

Make no abatementOnce more farewell all

As we are men

Thus should we do being sensually subdued

We lose our human title Good cheer ladies

Now turn we towards your comforts

Th' impartial gods who from the mounted heavens

View us their mortal herd behold who err

And in their time chastise Go and find out

The bones of your dead lords and honor them

With treble ceremony rather than a gap

Should be in their dear rites we would supply 't

But those we will depute which shall invest

You in your dignities and even each thing

Our haste does leave imperfect So adieu

And heaven's good eyes look on you    What are those

By th' helm of Mars I saw them in the war

Like to a pair of lions smeared with prey

Make lanes in troops aghast I fixed my note

Constantly on them for they were a mark

Worth a god's view What prisoner was 't that told me

When I enquired their names

'Tis right those those

They are not dead

Then like men use 'em

The very lees of such millions of rates

Exceed the wine of others All our surgeons

Convent in their behoof our richest balms

Rather than niggard waste Their lives concern us

Much more than Thebes is worth Rather than have 'em

Freed of this plight and in their morning state

Sound and at liberty I would 'em dead

But forty-thousandfold we had rather have 'em

Prisoners to us than Death Bear 'em speedily

From our kind air to them unkind and minister

What man to man may dofor our sake more

Since I have known frights fury friends' behests

Love's provocations zeal a mistress' task

Desire of liberty a fever madness

Hath set a mark which nature could not reach to

Without some imposition sickness in will

O'er-wrestling strength in reason For our love

And great Apollo's mercy all our best

Their best skill tenderLead into the city

Where having bound things scattered we will post

To Athens 'fore our army

You have done worthily I have not seen

Since Hercules a man of tougher sinews

Whate'er you are you run the best and wrestle

That these times can allow

What country bred you

Are you a gentleman

Are you his heir

Your father

Sure is a happy sire then What proves you

You are perfect

What made you seek this place sir

Sir we are much indebted to your travel

Nor shall you lose your wishPirithous

Dispose of this fair gentleman

Sweet you must be ready

And you Emiliaand you friendand all

Tomorrow by the sun to do observance

To flowery May in Dian's woodWait well sir

Upon your mistressEmily I hope

He shall not go afoot

Go lead the way you have won it

It shall be so you shall receive all dues

Fit for the honor you have won 'Twere wrong else

Sister beshrew my heart you have a servant

That if I were a woman would be master

But you are wise

This way the stag took

What have we here

Well sir go forward We

will edify

Ladies sit down We'll stay it

This is a cold beginning

Ay ay by any means dear Domine

Take twenty DomineHow does my sweetheart

Schoolmaster I thank youOne see 'em all rewarded

Now to our sports again

What ignorant and mad malicious traitors

Are you that 'gainst the tenor of my laws

Are making battle thus like knights appointed

Without my leave and officers of arms

By Castor both shall die

I have sworn

I grant your wish for to say true your cousin

Has ten times more offended for I gave him

More mercy than you found sir your offenses

Being no more than hisNone here speak for 'em

For ere the sun set both shall sleep forever

These are strange conjurings

You make my faith reel Say I felt

Compassion to 'em both how would you place it

You are a right woman sister you have pity

But want the understanding where to use it

If you desire their lives invent a way

Safer than banishment Can these two live

And have the agony of love about 'em

And not kill one another Every day

They'd fight about you hourly bring your honor

In public question with their swords Be wise then

And here forget 'em it concerns your credit

And my oath equally I have said they die

Better they fall by th' law than one another

Bow not my honor

What is it sister

On what conditions

Will you Arcite

Take these conditions

What may be done For now I feel compassion

Say Emilia

If one of them were dead as one must are you

Content to take th' other to your husband

They cannot both enjoy you They are princes

As goodly as your own eyes and as noble

As ever fame yet spoke of Look upon 'em

And if you can love end this difference

I give consentAre you content too princes

He that she refuses

Must die then

Make choice then

Thus I ordain it

And by mine honor once again it stands

Or both shall die you shall both to your country

And each within this month accompanied

With three fair knights appear again in this place

In which I'll plant a pyramid and whether

Before us that are here can force his cousin

By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar

He shall enjoy her the other lose his head

And all his friends nor shall he grudge to fall

Nor think he dies with interest in this lady

Will this content you

Are you content sister

 Come shake hands again then

And take heed as you are gentlemen this quarrel

Sleep till the hour prefixed and hold your course

Come I'll give you

Now usage like to princes and to friends

When you return who wins I'll settle here

Who loses yet I'll weep upon his bier

Bring 'em in

Quickly by any means I long to see 'em

Your two contending lovers are returned

And with them their fair knights Now my fair sister

You must love one of them

Who saw 'em

From whence come you sir

Pray speak

You that have seen them what they are

Thou hast well described him

Pray speak him friend

Are they all thus

Now as I have a soul I long to see 'em

Lady you shall see men fight now

You have steeled 'em with your beautyHonored friend

To you I give the field pray order it

Fitting the persons that must use it

Come I'll go visit 'em I cannot stay

Their fame has fired me sotill they appear

Good friend be royal

Now let 'em enter and before the gods

Tender their holy prayers Let the temples

Burn bright with sacred fires and the altars

In hallowed clouds commend their swelling incense

To those above us Let no due be wanting

They have a noble work in hand will honor

The very powers that love 'em

You valiant and strong-hearted enemies

You royal german foes that this day come

To blow that nearness out that flames between you

Lay by your anger for an hour and dove-like

Before the holy altars of your helpers

The all-feared gods bow down your stubborn bodies

Your ire is more than mortal so your help be

And as the gods regard you fight with justice

I'll leave you to your prayers and betwixt you

I part my wishes

O she must

She shall see deeds of honor in their kind

Which sometime show well penciled Nature now

Shall make and act the story the belief

Both sealed with eye and earYou must be present

You are the victor's meed the price and garland

To crown the question's title

You must be there

This trial is as 'twere i' th' night and you

The only star to shine

Why the knights must kindle

Their valor at your eye Know of this war

You are the treasure and must needs be by

To give the service pay

Well well then at your pleasure

Those that remain with you could wish their office

To any of their enemies

Lo where our sister is in expectation

Yet quaking and unsettledFairest Emily

The gods by their divine arbitrament

Have given you this knight he is a good one

As ever struck at headGive me your hands

Receive you her you him Be plighted with

A love that grows as you decay

O loved sister

He speaks now of as brave a knight as e'er

Did spur a noble steed Surely the gods

Would have him die a bachelor lest his race

Should show i' th' world too godlike His behavior

So charmed me that methought Alcides was

To him a sow of lead If I could praise

Each part of him to th' all I have spoke your Arcite

Did not lose by 't for he that was thus good

Encountered yet his better I have heard

Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o' th' night

With their contentious throats now one the higher

Anon the other then again the first

And by-and-by out-breasted that the sense

Could not be judge between 'em So it fared

Good space between these kinsmen till heavens did

Make hardly one the winnerWear the garland

With joy that you have wonFor the subdued

Give them our present justice since I know

Their lives but pinch 'em Let it here be done

The scene's not for our seeing Go we hence

Right joyful with some sorrowArm your prize

I know you will not lose herHippolyta

I see one eye of yours conceives a tear

The which it will deliver

So it is

In this place first you fought e'en very here

I sundered you Acknowledge to the gods

Our thanks that you are living

His part is played and though it were too short

He did it well Your day is lengthened and

The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you

The powerful Venus well hath graced her altar

And given you your love Our master Mars

Hath vouched his oracle and to Arcite gave

The grace of the contention So the deities

Have showed due justiceBear this hence

Never Fortune

Did play a subtler game The conquered triumphs

The victor has the loss yet in the passage

The gods have been most equalPalamon

Your kinsman hath confessed the right o' th' lady

Did lie in you for you first saw her and

Even then proclaimed your fancy He restored her

As your stol'n jewel and desired your spirit

To send him hence forgiven The gods my justice

Take from my hand and they themselves become

The executioners Lead your lady off

And call your lovers from the stage of death

Whom I adopt my friends A day or two

Let us look sadly and give grace unto

The funeral of Arcite in whose end

The visages of bridegrooms we'll put on

And smile with Palamonfor whom an hour

But one hour since I was as dearly sorry

As glad of Arcite and am now as glad

As for him sorry O you heavenly charmers

What things you make of us For what we lack

We laugh for what we have are sorry still

Are children in some kind Let us be thankful

For that which is and with you leave dispute

That are above our question Let's go off

And bear us like the time
