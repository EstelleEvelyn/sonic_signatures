Slain by his servant, going to put out

The other eye of Gloucester.

A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,

Opposed against the act, bending his sword

To his great master, who, thereat enraged,

Flew on him and amongst them felled him dead,

But not without that harmful stroke which since

Hath plucked him after.

Both, both, my lord.—

This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.

’Tis from your sister.

Come with my lady hither.

No, my good lord. I met him back again.

Ay, my good lord. ’Twas he informed against him

And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment

Might have the freer course.
