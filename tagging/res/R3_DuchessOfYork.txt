


No, boy.

My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.

I do lament the sickness of the King,

As loath to lose him, not your father’s death.

It were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost.

Peace, children, peace. The King doth love you well.

Incapable and shallow innocents,

You cannot guess who caused your father’s death.

Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,

And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice.

He is my son, ay, and therein my shame,

Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

Ay, boy.

What means this scene of rude impatience?

Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow

As I had title in thy noble husband.

I have bewept a worthy husband’s death

And lived with looking on his images;

But now two mirrors of his princely semblance

Are cracked in pieces by malignant death,

And I, for comfort, have but one false glass

That grieves me when I see my shame in him.

Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,

And hast the comfort of thy children left,

But death hath snatched my husband from mine arms

And plucked two crutches from my feeble hands,

Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I,

Thine being but a moiety of my moan,

To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!

Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

What stays had I but they? And they are gone.

Was never mother had so dear a loss.

Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.

Their woes are parceled; mine is general.

She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;

I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she.

These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;

I for an Edward weep; so do not they.

Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed,

Pour all your tears. I am your sorrow’s nurse,

And I will pamper it with lamentation.

God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast,

Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.

I long with all my heart to see the Prince.

I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

Why, my good cousin? It is good to grow.

Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold

In him that did object the same to thee!

He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,

So long a-growing and so leisurely,

That if his rule were true, he should be gracious.

I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.

How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.

I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?

His nurse? Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.

Good madam, be not angry with the child.

What is thy news?

Who hath committed them?

Accursèd and unquiet wrangling days,

How many of you have mine eyes beheld?

My husband lost his life to get the crown,

And often up and down my sons were tossed

For me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss.

And being seated, and domestic broils

Clean overblown, themselves the conquerors

Make war upon themselves, brother to brother,

Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous

And frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen,

Or let me die, to look on Earth no more.

Stay, I will go with you.

Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet

Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?

Now, for my life, she’s wandering to the Tower,

On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender prince.—

Daughter, well met.

I am their father’s mother. I will see them.

O ill-dispersing wind of misery!

O my accursèd womb, the bed of death!

A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world,

Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.

Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee.

Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee.

I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.

Eighty-odd years of sorrow have I seen,

And each hour’s joy wracked with a week of teen.

So many miseries have crazed my voice

That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.

Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,

Woe’s scene, world’s shame, grave’s due by life usurped,

Brief abstract and record of tedious days,

Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful earth,

Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.

I had a Richard too, and thou did’st kill him;

I had a Rutland too; thou holp’st to kill him.

O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!

God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

Why should calamity be full of words?

If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,

And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother

My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered.

The trumpet sounds. Be copious in exclaims.

O, she that might have intercepted thee,

By strangling thee in her accursèd womb,

From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.

Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence,

And little Ned Plantagenet his son?

Where is kind Hastings?

Art thou my son?

Then patiently hear my impatience.

O, let me speak!

I will be mild and gentle in my words.

Art thou so hasty? I have stayed for thee,

God knows, in torment and in agony.

No, by the Holy Rood, thou know’st it well.

Thou cam’st on Earth to make the Earth my hell.

A grievous burden was thy birth to me;

Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;

Thy school days frightful, desp’rate, wild, and furious;

Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;

Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,

More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred.

What comfortable hour canst thou name,

That ever graced me with thy company?

I prithee, hear me speak.

Hear me a word,

For I shall never speak to thee again.

Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance

Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,

Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish

And nevermore behold thy face again.

Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,

Which in the day of battle tire thee more

Than all the complete armor that thou wear’st.

My prayers on the adverse party fight,

And there the little souls of Edward’s children

Whisper the spirits of thine enemies

And promise them success and victory.

Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.

Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
