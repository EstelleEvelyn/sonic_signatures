To stop his ears against admonishment?

Unarm, unarm, and do not fight today.

My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day.

Here, sister, armed and bloody in intent.

Consort with me in loud and dear petition;

Pursue we him on knees. For I have dreamt

Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night

Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.

O, be persuaded! Do not count it holy

To hurt by being just. It is as lawful,

For we would give much, to use violent thefts

And rob in the behalf of charity.

Cassandra, call my father to persuade.

Do not, dear father.
