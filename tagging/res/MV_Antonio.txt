


In sooth I know not why I am so sad

It wearies me you say it wearies you

But how I caught it found it or came by it

What stuff 'tis made of whereof it is born

I am to learn

And such a want-wit sadness makes of me

That I have much ado to know myself

Believe me no I thank my fortune for it

My ventures are not in one bottom trusted

Nor to one place nor is my whole estate

Upon the fortune of this present year

Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad

Fie fie

Your worth is very dear in my regard

I take it your own business calls on you

And you embrace th' occasion to depart

I hold the world but as the world Gratiano

A stage where every man must play a part

And mine a sad one

Fare you well I'll grow a talker for this gear

Is that anything now

Well tell me now what lady is the same

To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage

That you today promised to tell me of

I pray you good Bassanio let me know it

And if it stand as you yourself still do

Within the eye of honor be assured

My purse my person my extremest means

Lie all unlocked to your occasions

You know me well and herein spend but time

To wind about my love with circumstance

And out of doubt you do me now more wrong

In making question of my uttermost

Than if you had made waste of all I have

Then do but say to me what I should do

That in your knowledge may by me be done

And I am prest unto it Therefore speak

Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea

Neither have I money nor commodity

To raise a present sum Therefore go forth

Try what my credit can in Venice do

That shall be racked even to the uttermost

To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia

Go presently inquire and so will I

Where money is and I no question make

To have it of my trust or for my sake

Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow

By taking nor by giving of excess

Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend

I'll break a custom Is he yet possessed

How much you would

And for three months

I do never use it

And what of him Did he take interest

This was a venture sir that Jacob served for

A thing not in his power to bring to pass

But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven

Was this inserted to make interest good

Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams

 Mark you this Bassanio

The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose

An evil soul producing holy witness

Is like a villain with a smiling cheek

A goodly apple rotten at the heart

O what a goodly outside falsehood hath

Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you

I am as like to call thee so again

To spet on thee again to spurn thee too

If thou wilt lend this money lend it not

As to thy friends for when did friendship take

A breed for barren metal of his friend

But lend it rather to thine enemy

Who if he break thou mayst with better face

Exact the penalty

Content in faith I'll seal to such a bond

And say there is much kindness in the Jew

Why fear not man I will not forfeit it

Within these two monthsthat's a month before

This bond expiresI do expect return

Of thrice three times the value of this bond

Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond

Hie thee gentle Jew

The Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind

Come on in this there can be no dismay

My ships come home a month before the day

Who's there

Fie fie Gratiano where are all the rest

'Tis nine o'clock Our friends all stay for you

No masque tonight the wind is come about

Bassanio presently will go aboard

I have sent twenty out to seek for you

Hear me yet good Shylock

I pray thee hear me speak

Let him alone

I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers

He seeks my life His reason well I know

I oft delivered from his forfeitures

Many that have at times made moan to me

Therefore he hates me

The Duke cannot deny the course of law

For the commodity that strangers have

With us in Venice if it be denied

Will much impeach the justice of the state

Since that the trade and profit of the city

Consisteth of all nations Therefore go

These griefs and losses have so bated me

That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh

Tomorrow to my bloody creditor

Well jailer onPray God Bassanio come

To see me pay his debt and then I care not

Ready so please your Grace

I have heard

Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify

His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate

And that no lawful means can carry me

Out of his envy's reach I do oppose

My patience to his fury and am armed

To suffer with a quietness of spirit

The very tyranny and rage of his

I pray you think you question with the Jew

You may as well go stand upon the beach

And bid the main flood bate his usual height

You may as well use question with the wolf

Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb

You may as well forbid the mountain pines

To wag their high tops and to make no noise

When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven

You may as well do anything most hard

As seek to soften that than which what's harder

His Jewish heart Therefore I do beseech you

Make no more offers use no farther means

But with all brief and plain conveniency

Let me have judgment and the Jew his will

I am a tainted wether of the flock

Meetest for death The weakest kind of fruit

Drops earliest to the ground and so let me

You cannot better be employed Bassanio

Than to live still and write mine epitaph

Ay so he says

I do

Most heartily I do beseech the court

To give the judgment

But little I am armed and well prepared

Give me your hand Bassanio Fare you well

Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you

For herein Fortune shows herself more kind

Than is her custom it is still her use

To let the wretched man outlive his wealth

To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow

An age of poverty from which ling'ring penance

Of such misery doth she cut me off

Commend me to your honorable wife

Tell her the process of Antonio's end

Say how I loved you speak me fair in death

And when the tale is told bid her be judge

Whether Bassanio had not once a love

Repent but you that you shall lose your friend

And he repents not that he pays your debt

For if the Jew do cut but deep enough

I'll pay it instantly with all my heart

So please my lord the Duke and all the court

To quit the fine for one half of his goods

I am content so he will let me have

The other half in use to render it

Upon his death unto the gentleman

That lately stole his daughter

Two things provided more that for this favor

He presently become a Christian

The other that he do record a gift

Here in the court of all he dies possessed

Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter

And stand indebted over and above

In love and service to you evermore

My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring

Let his deservings and my love withal

Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment

No more than I am well acquitted of

I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels

I once did lend my body for his wealth

Which but for him that had your husband's ring

Had quite miscarried I dare be bound again

My soul upon the forfeit that your lord

Will never more break faith advisedly

Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring

I am dumb

Sweet lady you have given me life and living

For here I read for certain that my ships

Are safely come to road
