For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.

No, it is stopped with other flattering sounds,

As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond;

Lascivious meters, to whose venom sound

The open ear of youth doth always listen;

Report of fashions in proud Italy,

Whose manners still our tardy-apish nation

Limps after in base imitation.

Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity—

So it be new, there’s no respect how vile—

That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?

Then all too late comes counsel to be heard

Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard.

Direct not him whose way himself will choose.

’Tis breath thou lack’st, and that breath wilt thou lose.

The King is come. Deal mildly with his youth,

For young hot colts being reined do rage the more.

I do beseech your Majesty, impute his words

To wayward sickliness and age in him.

He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear

As Harry, Duke of Hereford, were he here.

Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!

Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long

Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?

Not Gloucester’s death, nor Hereford’s banishment,

Nor Gaunt’s rebukes, nor England’s private wrongs,

Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke

About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,

Have ever made me sour my patient cheek

Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign’s face.

I am the last of noble Edward’s sons,

Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.

In war was never lion raged more fierce,

In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,

Than was that young and princely gentleman.

His face thou hast, for even so looked he,

Accomplished with the number of thy hours;

But when he frowned, it was against the French

And not against his friends. His noble hand

Did win what he did spend, and spent not that

Which his triumphant father’s hand had won.

His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,

But bloody with the enemies of his kin.

O, Richard! York is too far gone with grief,

Or else he never would compare between.

O, my liege,

Pardon me if you please. If not, I, pleased

Not to be pardoned, am content withal.

Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands

The royalties and rights of banished Hereford?

Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Hereford live?

Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true?

Did not the one deserve to have an heir?

Is not his heir a well-deserving son?

Take Hereford’s rights away, and take from time

His charters and his customary rights;

Let not tomorrow then ensue today;

Be not thyself; for how art thou a king

But by fair sequence and succession?

Now afore God—God forbid I say true!—

If you do wrongfully seize Hereford’s rights,

Call in the letters patents that he hath

By his attorneys general to sue

His livery, and deny his offered homage,

You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,

You lose a thousand well-disposèd hearts,

And prick my tender patience to those thoughts

Which honor and allegiance cannot think.

I’ll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.

What will ensue hereof there’s none can tell;

But by bad courses may be understood

That their events can never fall out good.

Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.

Comfort’s in heaven, and we are on the Earth,

Where nothing lives but crosses, cares, and grief.

Your husband, he is gone to save far off

Whilst others come to make him lose at home.

Here am I left to underprop his land,

Who, weak with age, cannot support myself.

Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;

Now shall he try his friends that flattered him.

He was? Why, so go all which way it will.

The nobles they are fled; the commons they are cold

And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford’s side.

Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;

Bid her send me presently a thousand pound.

Hold, take my ring.

What is ’t, knave?

God for His mercy, what a tide of woes

Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!

I know not what to do. I would to God,

So my untruth had not provoked him to it,

The King had cut off my head with my brother’s!

What, are there no posts dispatched for Ireland?

How shall we do for money for these wars?—

Come, sister—cousin I would say, pray pardon me.—

Go, fellow, get thee home. Provide some carts

And bring away the armor that is there.

Gentlemen, will you go muster men?

If I know how or which way to order these affairs

Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,

Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen.

T’ one is my sovereign, whom both my oath

And duty bids defend; t’ other again

Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wronged,

Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.

Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin,

I’ll dispose of you.—Gentlemen, go muster up your men

And meet me presently at Berkeley.

I should to Plashy too,

But time will not permit. All is uneven,

And everything is left at six and seven.

Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee,

Whose duty is deceivable and false.

Tut, tut!

Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.

I am no traitor’s uncle, and that word “grace”

In an ungracious mouth is but profane.

Why have those banished and forbidden legs

Dared once to touch a dust of England’s ground?

But then, more why: why have they dared to march

So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,

Frighting her pale-faced villages with war

And ostentation of despisèd arms?

Com’st thou because the anointed king is hence?

Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind

And in my loyal bosom lies his power.

Were I but now lord of such hot youth

As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself

Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,

From forth the ranks of many thousand French,

O, then, how quickly should this arm of mine,

Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee

And minister correction to thy fault!

Even in condition of the worst degree,

In gross rebellion and detested treason.

Thou art a banished man and here art come,

Before the expiration of thy time,

In braving arms against thy sovereign.

My lords of England, let me tell you this:

I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs

And labored all I could to do him right.

But in this kind to come, in braving arms,

Be his own carver and cut out his way

To find out right with wrong, it may not be.

And you that do abet him in this kind

Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

Well, well. I see the issue of these arms.

I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,

Because my power is weak and all ill-left.

But if I could, by Him that gave me life,

I would attach you all and make you stoop

Unto the sovereign mercy of the King.

But since I cannot, be it known unto you

I do remain as neuter. So fare you well—

Unless you please to enter in the castle

And there repose you for this night.

It may be I will go with you; but yet I’ll pause,

For I am loath to break our country’s laws.

Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are.

Things past redress are now with me past care.

A gentleman of mine I have dispatched

With letters of your love to her at large.

It would beseem the Lord Northumberland

To say “King Richard.” Alack the heavy day

When such a sacred king should hide his head!

The time hath been, would you have been so brief with him,

He would have been so brief to shorten you,

For taking so the head, your whole head’s length.

Take not, good cousin, further than you should,

Lest you mistake. The heavens are over our heads.

Yet looks he like a king. Behold, his eye,

As bright as is the eagle’s, lightens forth

Controlling majesty. Alack, alack for woe

That any harm should stain so fair a show!

Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee

From plume-plucked Richard, who with willing soul

Adopts thee heir, and his high scepter yields

To the possession of thy royal hand.

Ascend his throne, descending now from him,

And long live Henry, fourth of that name!

I will be his conduct.

To do that office of thine own goodwill

Which tired majesty did make thee offer:

The resignation of thy state and crown

To Henry Bolingbroke.

Where did I leave?

Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,

Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,

Which his aspiring rider seemed to know,

With slow but stately pace kept on his course,

Whilst all tongues cried “God save thee, Bolingbroke!”

You would have thought the very windows spake,

So many greedy looks of young and old

Through casements darted their desiring eyes

Upon his visage, and that all the walls

With painted imagery had said at once

“Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bolingbroke!”

Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,

Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed’s neck,

Bespake them thus: “I thank you, countrymen.”

And thus still doing, thus he passed along.

As in a theater the eyes of men,

After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,

Are idly bent on him that enters next,

Thinking his prattle to be tedious,

Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes

Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God save him!”

No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,

But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,

Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,

His face still combating with tears and smiles,

The badges of his grief and patience,

That had not God for some strong purpose steeled

The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,

And barbarism itself have pitied him.

But heaven hath a hand in these events,

To whose high will we bound our calm contents.

To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,

Whose state and honor I for aye allow.

Aumerle that was;

But that is lost for being Richard’s friend,

And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.

I am in parliament pledge for his truth

And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,

Lest you be cropped before you come to prime.

What news from Oxford? Do these jousts and triumphs hold?

You will be there, I know.

What seal is that that hangs without thy bosom?

Yea, lookst thou pale? Let me see the writing.

No matter, then, who see it.

I will be satisfied. Let me see the writing.

Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.

I fear, I fear—

Bound to himself? What doth he with a bond

That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.—

Boy, let me see the writing.

I will be satisfied. Let me see it, I say.

Treason! Foul treason! Villain, traitor, slave!

Ho, who is within there? Saddle my horse!—

God for his mercy, what treachery is here!

Give me my boots, I say! Saddle my horse!—

Now by mine honor, by my life, by my troth,

I will appeach the villain.

Peace, foolish woman.

Bring me my boots!—I will unto the King.

Give me my boots, I say.

Thou fond mad woman,

Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?

A dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament

And interchangeably set down their hands

To kill the King at Oxford.

Away, fond woman! Were he twenty times my son,

I would appeach him.

Make way, unruly woman!

My liege, beware! Look to thyself!

Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.

Open the door, secure, foolhardy king!

Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?

Open the door, or I will break it open.

Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know

The treason that my haste forbids me show.

It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.—

I tore it from the traitor’s bosom, king.

Fear, and not love, begets his penitence.

Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove

A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.

So shall my virtue be his vice’s bawd,

And he shall spend mine honor with his shame,

As thriftless sons their scraping fathers’ gold.

Mine honor lives when his dishonor dies,

Or my shamed life in his dishonor lies.

Thou kill’st me in his life: giving him breath,

The traitor lives, the true man’s put to death.

If thou do pardon whosoever pray,

More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.

This festered joint cut off, the rest rest sound.

This let alone will all the rest confound.

Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?

Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?

Against them both my true joints bended be.

Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace.

Speak it in French, king. Say “pardonne moy.”
