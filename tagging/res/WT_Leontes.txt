
Stay your thanks awhile,

And pay them when you part.

We are tougher, brother,

Than you can put us to ’t.

One sev’nnight longer.

We’ll part the time between ’s, then, and in that

I’ll no gainsaying.

Tongue-tied, our queen? Speak you.

Well said, Hermione.

Is he won yet?

At my request he would not.

Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st

To better purpose.

Never but once.

Why, that was when

Three crabbèd months had soured themselves to death

Ere I could make thee open thy white hand

And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter

“I am yours forever.”

Too hot, too hot!

To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.

I have tremor cordis on me. My heart dances,

But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment

May a free face put on, derive a liberty

From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,

And well become the agent. ’T may, I grant.

But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,

As now they are, and making practiced smiles

As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere

The mort o’ th’ deer—O, that is entertainment

My bosom likes not, nor my brows.—Mamillius,

Art thou my boy?

I’ fecks!

Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast smutched thy nose?

They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,

We must be neat—not neat, but cleanly, captain.

And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf

Are all called neat.—Still virginalling

Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf?

Art thou my calf?

Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have

To be full like me; yet they say we are

Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,

That will say anything. But were they false

As o’erdyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false

As dice are to be wished by one that fixes

No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true

To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,

Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain,

Most dear’st, my collop! Can thy dam?—may ’t be?—

Affection, thy intention stabs the center.

Thou dost make possible things not so held,

Communicat’st with dreams—how can this be?

With what’s unreal thou coactive art,

And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent

Thou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,

And that beyond commission, and I find it,

And that to the infection of my brains

And hard’ning of my brows.

What cheer? How is ’t with you, best brother?

No, in good earnest.

How sometimes nature will betray its folly,

Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime

To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines

Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil

Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched,

In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled

Lest it should bite its master and so prove,

As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.

How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,

This squash, this gentleman.—Mine honest friend,

Will you take eggs for money?

You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole!—My brother,

Are you so fond of your young prince as we

Do seem to be of ours?

So stands this squire

Officed with me. We two will walk, my lord,

And leave you to your graver steps.—Hermione,

How thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome.

Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.

Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s

Apparent to my heart.

To your own bents dispose you. You’ll be found,

Be you beneath the sky. I am angling now,

Though you perceive me not how I give line.

Go to, go to!

How she holds up the neb, the bill to him,

And arms her with the boldness of a wife

To her allowing husband!  Gone already.

Inch thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a forked one!—

Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I

Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue

Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamor

Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play.—There have been,

Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;

And many a man there is, even at this present,

Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm,

That little thinks she has been sluiced in ’s absence,

And his pond fished by his next neighbor, by

Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t

Whiles other men have gates and those gates opened,

As mine, against their will. Should all despair

That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind

Would hang themselves. Physic for ’t there’s none.

It is a bawdy planet, that will strike

Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it,

From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,

No barricado for a belly. Know ’t,

It will let in and out the enemy

With bag and baggage. Many thousand on ’s

Have the disease and feel ’t not.—How now, boy?

Why, that’s some comfort.—

What, Camillo there?

Go play, Mamillius. Thou ’rt an honest man.

Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

Didst note it?

Didst perceive it?

They’re here with me already, whisp’ring, rounding:

“Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone

When I shall gust it last.—How came ’t, Camillo,

That he did stay?

“At the queen’s” be ’t. “Good” should be pertinent,

But so it is, it is not. Was this taken

By any understanding pate but thine?

For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in

More than the common blocks. Not noted, is ’t,

But of the finer natures, by some severals

Of headpiece extraordinary? Lower messes

Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.

Ha?

Ay, but why?

Satisfy?

Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?

Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,

With all the nearest things to my heart, as well

My chamber-counsels, wherein, priestlike, thou

Hast cleansed my bosom; I from thee departed

Thy penitent reformed. But we have been

Deceived in thy integrity, deceived

In that which seems so.

To bide upon ’t: thou art not honest; or,

If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,

Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining

From course required; or else thou must be counted

A servant grafted in my serious trust

And therein negligent; or else a fool

That seest a game played home, the rich stake drawn,

And tak’st it all for jest.

Ha’ not you seen, Camillo—

But that’s past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass

Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn—or heard—

For to a vision so apparent, rumor

Cannot be mute—or thought—for cogitation

Resides not in that man that does not think—

My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess—

Or else be impudently negative

To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought—then say

My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name

As rank as any flax-wench that puts to

Before her troth-plight. Say ’t, and justify ’t.

Is whispering nothing?

Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?

Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career

Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible

Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?

Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?

Hours minutes? Noon midnight? And all eyes

Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,

That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?

Why, then the world and all that’s in ’t is nothing,

The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,

My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,

If this be nothing.

Say it be, ’tis true.

It is. You lie, you lie.

I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,

Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,

Or else a hovering temporizer that

Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,

Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver

Infected as her life, she would not live

The running of one glass.

Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging

About his neck—Bohemia, who, if I

Had servants true about me, that bare eyes

To see alike mine honor as their profits,

Their own particular thrifts, they would do that

Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou,

His cupbearer—whom I from meaner form

Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see

Plainly as heaven sees Earth and Earth sees heaven

How I am galled—mightst bespice a cup

To give mine enemy a lasting wink,

Which draft to me were cordial.

Make that thy question, and go rot!

Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,

To appoint myself in this vexation, sully

The purity and whiteness of my sheets—

Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted

Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps—

Give scandal to the blood o’ th’ Prince, my son,

Who I do think is mine and love as mine,

Without ripe moving to ’t? Would I do this?

Could man so blench?

Thou dost advise me

Even so as I mine own course have set down.

I’ll give no blemish to her honor, none.

This is all.

Do ’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;

Do ’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.

I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?

How blest am I

In my just censure, in my true opinion!

Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed

In being so blest! There may be in the cup

A spider steeped, and one may drink, depart,

And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge

Is not infected; but if one present

Th’ abhorred ingredient to his eye, make known

How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,

With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.

Camillo was his help in this, his pander.

There is a plot against my life, my crown.

All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain

Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.

He has discovered my design, and I

Remain a pinched thing, yea, a very trick

For them to play at will. How came the posterns

So easily open?

I know ’t too well.

Give me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse him.

Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you

Have too much blood in him.

Bear the boy hence. He shall not come about her.

Away with him, and let her sport herself

With that she’s big with, for ’tis Polixenes

Has made thee swell thus.

You, my lords,

Look on her, mark her well. Be but about

To say “She is a goodly lady,” and

The justice of your hearts will thereto add

“’Tis pity she’s not honest, honorable.”

Praise her but for this her without-door form,

Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight

The shrug, the “hum,” or “ha,” these petty brands

That calumny doth use—O, I am out,

That mercy does, for calumny will sear

Virtue itself—these shrugs, these s‘” and s‘”,

When you have said she’s goodly, come between

Ere you can say she’s honest. But be ’t known,

From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,

She’s an adult’ress.

You have mistook, my lady,

Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,

Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place

Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,

Should a like language use to all degrees,

And mannerly distinguishment leave out

Betwixt the prince and beggar.—I have said

She’s an adult’ress; I have said with whom.

More, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is

A federary with her, and one that knows

What she should shame to know herself

But with her most vile principal: that she’s

A bed-swerver, even as bad as those

That vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy

To this their late escape.

No. If I mistake

In those foundations which I build upon,

The center is not big enough to bear

A schoolboy’s top.—Away with her to prison.

He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty

But that he speaks.

Shall I be heard?

Go, do our bidding. Hence!

Hold your peaces.

Cease. No more.

You smell this business with a sense as cold

As is a dead man’s nose. But I do see ’t and feel ’t,

As you feel doing thus, and see withal

The instruments that feel.

What? Lack I credit?

Why, what need we

Commune with you of this, but rather follow

Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative

Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness

Imparts this, which if you—or stupefied

Or seeming so in skill—cannot or will not

Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves

We need no more of your advice. The matter,

The loss, the gain, the ord’ring on ’t is all

Properly ours.

How could that be?

Either thou art most ignorant by age,

Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,

Added to their familiarity—

Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture,

That lacked sight only, naught for approbation

But only seeing, all other circumstances

Made up to th’ deed—doth push on this proceeding.

Yet, for a greater confirmation—

For in an act of this importance ’twere

Most piteous to be wild—I have dispatched in post

To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,

Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know

Of stuffed sufficiency. Now from the oracle

They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had

Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

Though I am satisfied and need no more

Than what I know, yet shall the oracle

Give rest to th’ minds of others, such as he

Whose ignorant credulity will not

Come up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good

From our free person she should be confined,

Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence

Be left her to perform. Come, follow us.

We are to speak in public, for this business

Will raise us all.

Nor night nor day no rest. It is but weakness

To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If

The cause were not in being—part o’ th’ cause,

She th’ adult’ress, for the harlot king

Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank

And level of my brain, plot-proof. But she

I can hook to me. Say that she were gone,

Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest

Might come to me again.—Who’s there?

How does the boy?

To see his nobleness,

Conceiving the dishonor of his mother.

He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,

Fastened and fixed the shame on ’t in himself,

Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,

And downright languished. Leave me solely. Go,

See how he fares. Fie, fie, no thought of him.

The very thought of my revenges that way

Recoil upon me—in himself too mighty,

And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be

Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,

Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes

Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow.

They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor

Shall she within my power.

What noise there, ho?

How?—

Away with that audacious lady. Antigonus,

I charged thee that she should not come about me.

I knew she would.

What, canst not rule her?

Good queen?

Force her hence.

Out!

A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door.

A most intelligencing bawd.

Traitors,

Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard,

Thou dotard; thou art woman-tired, unroosted

By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,

Take ’t up, I say. Give ’t to thy crone.

He dreads his wife.

A nest of traitors!

A callet

Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband

And now baits me! This brat is none of mine.

It is the issue of Polixenes.

Hence with it, and together with the dam

Commit them to the fire.

A gross hag!—

And, losel, thou art worthy to be hanged

That wilt not stay her tongue.

Once more, take her hence.

I’ll ha’ thee burnt.

On your allegiance,

Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,

Where were her life? She durst not call me so

If she did know me one. Away with her!

Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.

My child? Away with ’t! Even thou, that hast

A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,

And see it instantly consumed with fire.

Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight.

Within this hour bring me word ’tis done,

And by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life,

With what thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse

And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so.

The bastard brains with these my proper hands

Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,

For thou sett’st on thy wife.

You’re liars all.

I am a feather for each wind that blows.

Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel

And call me father? Better burn it now

Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.

It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither,

You that have been so tenderly officious

With Lady Margery, your midwife there,

To save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,

So sure as this beard’s gray. What will you adventure

To save this brat’s life?

It shall be possible. Swear by this sword

Thou wilt perform my bidding.

Mark, and perform it, seest thou; for the fail

Of any point in ’t shall not only be

Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,

Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,

As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry

This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it

To some remote and desert place quite out

Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,

Without more mercy, to it own protection

And favor of the climate. As by strange fortune

It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,

On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,

That thou commend it strangely to some place

Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

No, I’ll not rear

Another’s issue.

Twenty-three days

They have been absent. ’Tis good speed, foretells

The great Apollo suddenly will have

The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords.

Summon a session, that we may arraign

Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath

Been publicly accused, so shall she have

A just and open trial. While she lives,

My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,

And think upon my bidding.

This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,

Even pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried

The daughter of a king, our wife, and one

Of us too much beloved. Let us be cleared

Of being tyrannous, since we so openly

Proceed in justice, which shall have due course

Even to the guilt or the purgation.

Produce the prisoner.

Read the indictment.

I ne’er heard yet

That any of these bolder vices wanted

Less impudence to gainsay what they did

Than to perform it first.

You will not own it.

You knew of his departure, as you know

What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.

Your actions are my dreams.

You had a bastard by Polixenes,

And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame—

Those of your fact are so—so past all truth,

Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as

Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,

No father owning it—which is indeed

More criminal in thee than it—so thou

Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage

Look for no less than death.

Break up the seals and read.

Hast thou read truth?

There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle.

The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.

What is the business?

How? Gone?

Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves

Do strike at my injustice.  How now there?

Take her hence.

Her heart is but o’ercharged. She will recover.

I have too much believed mine own suspicion.

Beseech you, tenderly apply to her

Some remedies for life.    Apollo, pardon

My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle.

I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,

New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,

Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;

For, being transported by my jealousies

To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose

Camillo for the minister to poison

My friend Polixenes, which had been done

But that the good mind of Camillo tardied

My swift command, though I with death and with

Reward did threaten and encourage him,

Not doing it and being done. He, most humane

And filled with honor, to my kingly guest

Unclasped my practice, quit his fortunes here,

Which you knew great, and to the hazard

Of all incertainties himself commended,

No richer than his honor. How he glisters

Through my rust, and how his piety

Does my deeds make the blacker!

Go on, go on.

Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved

All tongues to talk their bitt’rest.

Thou didst speak but well

When most the truth, which I receive much better

Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me

To the dead bodies of my queen and son.

One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall

The causes of their death appear, unto

Our shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit

The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there

Shall be my recreation. So long as nature

Will bear up with this exercise, so long

I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me

To these sorrows.

Whilst I remember

Her and her virtues, I cannot forget

My blemishes in them, and so still think of

The wrong I did myself, which was so much

That heirless it hath made my kingdom and

Destroyed the sweet’st companion that e’er man

Bred his hopes out of.

I think so. Killed?

She I killed? I did so, but thou strik’st me

Sorely to say I did. It is as bitter

Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,

Say so but seldom.

Good Paulina,

Who hast the memory of Hermione,

I know, in honor, O, that ever I

Had squared me to thy counsel! Then even now

I might have looked upon my queen’s full eyes,

Have taken treasure from her lips—

Thou speak’st truth.

No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse,

And better used, would make her sainted spirit

Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,

Where we offenders now appear, soul-vexed,

And begin “Why to me?”

She had, and would incense me

To murder her I married.

Stars, stars,

And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;

I’ll have no wife, Paulina.

Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit.

My true Paulina,

We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.

What with him? He comes not

Like to his father’s greatness. His approach,

So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us

’Tis not a visitation framed, but forced

By need and accident. What train?

His princess, say you, with him?

Go, Cleomenes.

Yourself, assisted with your honored friends,

Bring them to our embracement.  Still, ’tis strange

He thus should steal upon us.

Prithee, no more; cease. Thou know’st

He dies to me again when talked of. Sure,

When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches

Will bring me to consider that which may

Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.

Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,

For she did print your royal father off,

Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,

Your father’s image is so hit in you,

His very air, that I should call you brother,

As I did him, and speak of something wildly

By us performed before. Most dearly welcome,

And your fair princess—goddess! O, alas,

I lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and Earth

Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as

You, gracious couple, do. And then I lost—

All mine own folly—the society,

Amity too, of your brave father, whom,

Though bearing misery, I desire my life

Once more to look on him.

O my brother,

Good gentleman, the wrongs I have done thee stir

Afresh within me, and these thy offices,

So rarely kind, are as interpreters

Of my behindhand slackness. Welcome hither,

As is the spring to th’ earth. And hath he too

Exposed this paragon to th’ fearful usage,

At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,

To greet a man not worth her pains, much less

Th’ adventure of her person?

Where the warlike Smalus,

That noble honored lord, is feared and loved?

The blessèd gods

Purge all infection from our air whilst you

Do climate here! You have a holy father,

A graceful gentleman, against whose person,

So sacred as it is, I have done sin,

For which the heavens, taking angry note,

Have left me issueless. And your father’s blest,

As he from heaven merits it, with you,

Worthy his goodness. What might I have been

Might I a son and daughter now have looked on,

Such goodly things as you?

Where’s Bohemia? Speak.

Who? Camillo?

You are married?

My lord,

Is this the daughter of a king?

That “once,” I see, by your good father’s speed

Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,

Most sorry, you have broken from his liking,

Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry

Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,

That you might well enjoy her.

Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,

Which he counts but a trifle.

I thought of her

Even in these looks I made. But your petition

Is yet unanswered. I will to your father.

Your honor not o’erthrown by your desires,

I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand

I now go toward him. Therefore follow me,

And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.

O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort

That I have had of thee!

O Paulina,

We honor you with trouble. But we came

To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery

Have we passed through, not without much content

In many singularities; but we saw not

That which my daughter came to look upon,

The statue of her mother.

Her natural posture!—

Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed

Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she

In thy not chiding, for she was as tender

As infancy and grace.—But yet, Paulina,

Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing

So agèd as this seems.

As now she might have done,

So much to my good comfort as it is

Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,

Even with such life of majesty—warm life,

As now it coldly stands—when first I wooed her.

I am ashamed. Does not the stone rebuke me

For being more stone than it?—O royal piece,

There’s magic in thy majesty, which has

My evils conjured to remembrance and

From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,

Standing like stone with thee.

Do not draw the curtain.

Let be, let be.

Would I were dead but that methinks already—

What was he that did make it?—See, my lord,

Would you not deem it breathed? And that those veins

Did verily bear blood?

The fixture of her eye has motion in ’t,

As we are mocked with art.

O sweet Paulina,

Make me to think so twenty years together!

No settled senses of the world can match

The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.

Do, Paulina,

For this affliction has a taste as sweet

As any cordial comfort. Still methinks

There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel

Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,

For I will kiss her.

No, not these twenty years.

What you can make her do

I am content to look on; what to speak,

I am content to hear, for ’tis as easy

To make her speak as move.

Proceed.

No foot shall stir.

O, she’s warm!

If this be magic, let it be an art

Lawful as eating.

O peace, Paulina.

Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,

As I by thine a wife. This is a match,

And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine—

But how is to be questioned, for I saw her,

As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many

A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far—

For him, I partly know his mind—to find thee

An honorable husband.—Come, Camillo,

And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty

Is richly noted and here justified

By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.

What, look upon my brother! Both your pardons

That e’er I put between your holy looks

My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law

And son unto the King, whom heavens directing,

Is troth-plight to your daughter.—Good Paulina,

Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely

Each one demand and answer to his part

Performed in this wide gap of time since first

We were dissevered. Hastily lead away.
