
My noble father

I do perceive here a divided duty

To you I am bound for life and education

My life and education both do learn me

How to respect you You are the lord of duty

I am hitherto your daughter But here's my husband

And so much duty as my mother showed

To you preferring you before her father

So much I challenge that I may profess

Due to the Moor my lord

Nor would I there reside

To put my father in impatient thoughts

By being in his eye Most gracious duke

To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear

And let me find a charter in your voice

T' assist my simpleness

That I love the Moor to live with him

My downright violence and storm of fortunes

May trumpet to the world My heart's subdued

Even to the very quality of my lord

I saw Othello's visage in his mind

And to his honors and his valiant parts

Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate

So that dear lords if I be left behind

A moth of peace and he go to the war

The rites for why I love him are bereft me

And I a heavy interim shall support

By his dear absence Let me go with him

I thank you valiant Cassio

What tidings can you tell of my lord

O but I fearHow lost you company

Alas she has no speech

Oh fie upon thee slanderer

What wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise me

Come on assayThere's one gone to the harbor

I am not merry but I do beguile

The thing I am by seeming otherwise

Come how wouldst thou praise me

Well praised How if she be black and witty

Worse and worse

These are old fond paradoxes to make

fools laugh i' th' alehouse What miserable praise

hast thou for her that's foul and foolish

O heavy ignorance Thou praisest the

worst best But what praise couldst thou bestow on

a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority

of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very

malice itself

To do what

O most lame and impotent conclusion

Do not learn of him Emilia though he be thy

husbandHow say you Cassio Is he not a most

profane and liberal counselor

Let's meet him and receive him

My dear Othello

The heavens forbid

But that our loves and comforts should increase

Even as our days do grow

What is the matter dear

Be thou assured good Cassio I will do

All my abilities in thy behalf

O that's an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio

But I will have my lord and you again

As friendly as you were

I know 't I thank you You do love my lord

You have known him long and be you well assured

He shall in strangeness stand no farther off

Than in a politic distance

Do not doubt that Before Emilia here

I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee

If I do vow a friendship I'll perform it

To the last article My lord shall never rest

I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience

His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift

I'll intermingle everything he does

With Cassio's suit Therefore be merry Cassio

For thy solicitor shall rather die

Than give thy cause away

Why stay and hear me speak

Well do your discretion

How now my lord

I have been talking with a suitor here

A man that languishes in your displeasure

Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord

If I have any grace or power to move you

His present reconciliation take

For if he be not one that truly loves you

That errs in ignorance and not in cunning

I have no judgment in an honest face

I prithee call him back

Yes faith so humbled

That he hath left part of his grief with me

To suffer with him Good love call him back

But shall 't be shortly

Shall 't be tonight at supper

Tomorrow dinner then

Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn

On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn

I prithee name the time but let it not

Exceed three days In faith he's penitent

And yet his trespass in our common reason

Save that they say the wars must make example

Out of her bestis not almost a fault

T' incur a private check When shall he come

Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul

What you would ask me that I should deny

Or stand so mamm'ring on What Michael Cassio

That came a-wooing with you and so many a time

When I have spoke of you dispraisingly

Hath ta'en your partto have so much to do

To bring him in By 'r Lady I could do much

Why this is not a boon

'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves

Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm

Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit

To your own person Nay when I have a suit

Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed

It shall be full of poise and difficult weight

And fearful to be granted

Shall I deny you No Farewell my lord

Emilia comeBe as your fancies teach you

Whate'er you be I am obedient

How now my dear Othello

Your dinner and the generous islanders

By you invited do attend your presence

Why do you speak so faintly Are you not well

Faith that's with watching 'Twill away again

Let me but bind it hard within this hour

It will be well

I am very sorry that you are not well

Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant

Cassio lies

Why man

Go to Where lodges he

Can anything be made of this

Can you inquire him out and be edified

by report

Seek him bid him come hither Tell him I

have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will

be well

Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia

Believe me I had rather have lost my purse

Full of crusadoes And but my noble Moor

Is true of mind and made of no such baseness

As jealous creatures are it were enough

To put him to ill thinking

Who he I think the sun where he was born

Drew all such humors from him

I will not leave him now till Cassio

Be called to himHow is 't with you my lord

Well my good lord

It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow

You may indeed say so

For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart

I cannot speak of this Come now your promise

I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you

Here my lord

I have it not about me

No faith my lord

Is 't possible

I' faith is 't true

Then would to God that I had never seen 't

Why do you speak so startingly and rash

Heaven bless us

It is not lost but what an if it were

I say it is not lost

Why so I can But I will not now

This is a trick to put me from my suit

Pray you let Cassio be received again

Come come

You'll never meet a more sufficient man

I pray talk me of Cassio

A man that all his time

Hath founded his good fortunes on your love

Shared dangers with you

I' faith you are to blame

I ne'er saw this before

Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief

I am most unhappy in the loss of it

How now good Cassio what's the news with you

Alas thrice-gentle Cassio

My advocation is not now in tune

My lord is not my lord nor should I know him

Were he in favor as in humor altered

So help me every spirit sanctified

As I have spoken for you all my best

And stood within the blank of his displeasure

For my free speech You must awhile be patient

What I can do I will and more I will

Than for myself I dare Let that suffice you

I prithee do so Something sure of state

Either from Venice or some unhatched practice

Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him

Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases

Men's natures wrangle with inferior things

Though great ones are their object 'Tis even so

For let our finger ache and it endues

Our other healthful members even to a sense

Of pain Nay we must think men are not gods

Nor of them look for such observancy

As fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia

I wasunhandsome warrior as I am

Arraigning his unkindness with my soul

But now I find I had suborned the witness

And he's indicted falsely

Alas the day I never gave him cause

Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind

I will go seek himCassio walk hereabout

If I do find him fit I'll move your suit

And seek to effect it to my uttermost

And what's the news good cousin Lodovico

Cousin there's fall'n between him and my lord

An unkind breach but you shall make all well

My lord

A most unhappy one I would do much

T' atone them for the love I bear to Cassio

My lord

What is he angry

By my troth I am glad on 't

My lord

Why sweet Othello

I have not deserved this

I will not stay to offend you

My lord

My lord what is your will

What is your pleasure

What horrible fancy's this

Upon my knees what doth your speech import

I understand a fury in your words

But not the words

Your wife my lord your true and loyal wife

Heaven doth truly know it

To whom my lord With whom How am I false

Alas the heavy day why do you weep

Am I the motive of these tears my lord

If haply you my father do suspect

An instrument of this your calling back

Lay not your blame on me If you have lost him

I have lost him too

I hope my noble lord esteems me honest

Alas what ignorant sin have I committed

By heaven you do me wrong

No as I am a Christian

If to preserve this vessel for my lord

From any other foul unlawful touch

Be not to be a strumpet I am none

No as I shall be saved

O heaven forgive us

Faith half asleep

With who

Who is thy lord

I have none Do not talk to me Emilia

I cannot weep nor answers have I none

But what should go by water Prithee tonight

Lay on my bed my wedding sheets Remember

And call thy husband hither

'Tis meet I should be used so very meet

How have I been behaved that he might stick

The small'st opinion on my least misuse

I cannot tell Those that do teach young babes

Do it with gentle means and easy tasks

He might have chid me so for in good faith

I am a child to chiding

Am I that name Iago

Such as she said my lord did say I was

I do not know I am sure I am none such

It is my wretched fortune

Nay heaven doth know

If any such there be heaven pardon him

Alas Iago

What shall I do to win my lord again

Good friend go to him For by this light of heaven

I know not how I lost him Here I kneel

If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love

Either in discourse of thought or actual deed

Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense

Delighted them in any other form

Or that I do not yet and ever did

And ever willthough he do shake me off

To beggarly divorcementlove him dearly

Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much

And his unkindness may defeat my life

But never taint my love I cannot say whore

It does abhor me now I speak the word

To do the act that might the addition earn

Not the world's mass of vanity could make me

If 'twere no other

Your Honor is most welcome

My lord

I will my lord

He says he will return incontinent

And hath commanded me to go to bed

And bade me to dismiss you

It was his bidding Therefore good Emilia

Give me my nightly wearing and adieu

We must not now displease him

So would not I My love doth so approve him

That even his stubbornness his checks his frowns

Prithee unpin mehave grace and favor in them

All's one Good faith how foolish are our minds

If I do die before thee prithee shroud me

In one of those same sheets

My mother had a maid called Barbary

She was in love and he she loved proved mad

And did forsake her She had a song of willow

An old thing 'twas but it expressed her fortune

And she died singing it That song tonight

Will not go from my mind I have much to do

But to go hang my head all at one side

And sing it like poor Barbary Prithee dispatch

No unpin me here

This Lodovico is a proper man

He speaks well

The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree

Sing all a green willow

Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee

Sing willow willow willow

The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans

Sing willow willow willow

Her salt tears fell from her and softened the stones

Lay by these

Sing willow willow willow

Prithee hie thee He'll come anon

Sing all a green willow must be my garland

Let nobody blame him his scorn I approve

Nay that's not next Hark who is 't that knocks

I called my love false love but what said he then

Sing willow willow willow

If I court more women you'll couch with more men

So get thee gone Good night Mine eyes do itch

Doth that bode weeping

I have heard it said so O these men these men

Dost thou in conscience thinktell me Emilia

That there be women do abuse their husbands

In such gross kind

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world

No by this heavenly light

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world

In troth I think thou wouldst not

Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong

for the whole world

I do not think there is any such woman

Good night good night God me such uses send

Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend

Who's there Othello

Will you come to bed my lord

Ay my lord

Alack my lord

What may you mean by that

Talk you of killing

Then heaven have mercy on me

If you say so I hope you will not kill me

And yet I fear you for you're fatal then

When your eyes roll so Why I should fear I know not

Since guiltiness I know not but yet I feel I fear

They are loves I bear to you

That death's unnatural that kills for loving

Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip

Some bloody passion shakes your very frame

These are portents but yet I hope I hope

They do not point on me

I will so What's the matter

No by my life and soul Send for the man

And ask him

Ay but not yet to die

Then Lord have mercy on me

And have you mercy too I never did

Offend you in my life never loved Cassio

But with such general warranty of heaven

As I might love I never gave him token

He found it then

I never gave it him Send for him hither

Let him confess a truth

What my lord

How Unlawfully

He will not say so

O my fear interprets What is he dead

Alas he is betrayed and I undone

O banish me my lord but kill me not

Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight

But half an hour

But while I say one prayer

O falsely falsely murdered

A guiltless death I die

Nobody I myself Farewell

Commend me to my kind lord O farewell
