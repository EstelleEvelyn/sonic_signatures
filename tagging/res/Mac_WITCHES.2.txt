


When the hurly-burly's done

When the battle's lost and won

Upon the heath

Paddock calls

Fair is foul and foul is fair

Hover through the fog and filthy air

Killing swine

I'll give thee a wind

Show me show me

The Werd Sisters hand in hand

Posters of the sea and land

Thus do go about about

Thrice to thine and thrice to mine

And thrice again to make up nine

Peace the charm's wound up

All hail Macbeth Hail to thee Thane of Cawdor

Hail

Not so happy yet much happier

Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined

Double double toil and trouble

Fire burn and cauldron bubble

Fillet of a fenny snake

In the cauldron boil and bake

Eye of newt and toe of frog

Wool of bat and tongue of dog

Adder's fork and blindworm's sting

Lizard's leg and howlet's wing

For a charm of powerful trouble

Like a hell-broth boil and bubble

Double double toil and trouble

Fire burn and cauldron bubble

Double double toil and trouble

Fire burn and cauldron bubble

Cool it with a baboon's blood

Then the charm is firm and good

By the pricking of my thumbs

Something wicked this way comes

Open locks

Whoever knocks

A deed without a name

Demand

Come high or low

Thyself and office deftly show

Listen but speak not to 't

Seek to know no more

Show

Show his eyes and grieve his heart

Come like shadows so depart
