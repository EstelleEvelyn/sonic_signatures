
Lucius

What do we meet together

Most true he does

It is against my heart

I'm weary of this charge the gods can witness

I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth

And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth

And mine my lord

Faith I perceive our masters may throw

their caps at their money These debts may well be

called desperate ones for a madman owes 'em
