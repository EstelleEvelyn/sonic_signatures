


Indeed they are disproportioned

My letters say a hundred and seven galleys

This cannot be

By no assay of reason 'Tis a pageant

To keep us in false gaze When we consider

Th' importancy of Cyprus to the Turk

And let ourselves again but understand

That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes

So may he with more facile question bear it

For that it stands not in such warlike brace

But altogether lacks th' abilities

That Rhodes is dressed inif we make thought of this

We must not think the Turk is so unskillful

To leave that latest which concerns him first

Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain

To wake and wage a danger profitless

Ay so I thought How many as you guess

He's now in Florence

Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor

Dead

We are very sorry for 't

But Othello speak

Did you by indirect and forcd courses

Subdue and poison this young maid's affections

Or came it by request and such fair question

As soul to soul affordeth

You must away tonight

Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well
