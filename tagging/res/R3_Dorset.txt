


No man but prophesied revenge for it

Dispute not with her she is lunatic

It touches you my lord as much as me

This interchange of love I here protest

Upon my part shall be inviolable

Ay my good lord and no man in the presence

But his red color hath forsook his cheeks

Comfort dear mother God is much displeased

That you take with unthankfulness His doing

In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful

With dull unwillingness to repay a debt

Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent

Much more to be thus opposite with heaven

For it requires the royal debt it lent you

Be of good cheer mother How fares your Grace

Farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory
