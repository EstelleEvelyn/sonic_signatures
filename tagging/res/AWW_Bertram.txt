


And I in going, madam, weep o’er my

father’s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty’s

command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore

in subjection.

What is it, my good lord, the King languishes

of?

I heard not of it before.

Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

The best wishes that can be forged in your

thoughts be servants to you.

Be comfortable to my mother, your

mistress, and make much of her.

My thanks and duty are your Majesty’s.

His good remembrance, sir,

Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb.

So in approof lives not his epitaph

As in your royal speech.

Some six months since, my lord.

Thank your Majesty.

I am commanded here and kept a coil

With “Too young,” and “The next year,” and “’Tis too early.”

I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,

Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry

Till honor be bought up, and no sword worn

But one to dance with. By heaven, I’ll steal away!

I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured

body.

Stay the King.

And I will do so.

And so ’tis.

My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your Highness

In such a business give me leave to use

The help of mine own eyes.

Yes, my good lord,

But never hope to know why I should marry her.

But follows it, my lord, to bring me down

Must answer for your raising? I know her well;

She had her breeding at my father’s charge.

A poor physician’s daughter my wife? Disdain

Rather corrupt me ever!

I cannot love her, nor will strive to do ’t.

Pardon, my gracious lord, for I submit

My fancy to your eyes. When I consider

What great creation and what dole of honor

Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late

Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now

The praisèd of the King, who, so ennobled,

Is as ’twere born so.

I take her hand.

Undone, and forfeited to cares forever!

Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,

I will not bed her.

O my Parolles, they have married me!

I’ll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.

There’s letters from my mother. What th’

import is I know not yet.

It shall be so. I’ll send her to my house,

Acquaint my mother with my hate to her

And wherefore I am fled, write to the King

That which I durst not speak. His present gift

Shall furnish me to those Italian fields

Where noble fellows strike. Wars is no strife

To the dark house and the detested wife.

Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.

I’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow

I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

And by other warranted testimony.

I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in

knowledge and accordingly valiant.

Is she gone to the King?

Will she away tonight?

I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,

Given order for our horses, and tonight,

When I should take possession of the bride,

End ere I do begin.

Is there any unkindness

between my lord and you, monsieur?

It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

I think not so.

Yes, I do know him well, and common speech

Gives him a worthy pass.    Here comes my clog.

I shall obey his will.

You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,

Which holds not color with the time, nor does

The ministration and requirèd office

On my particular. Prepared I was not

For such a business; therefore am I found

So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you

That presently you take your way for home,

And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;

For my respects are better than they seem,

And my appointments have in them a need

Greater than shows itself at the first view

To you that know them not. This to my mother.

’Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so

I leave you to your wisdom.

Come, come, no more of that.

Let that go.

My haste is very great. Farewell. Hie home.

Well, what would you say?

What would you have?

I pray you stay not, but in haste to horse.

Go thou toward home, where I will never come

Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.—

Away, and for our flight.

Sir, it is

A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet

We’ll strive to bear it for your worthy sake

To th’ extreme edge of hazard.

This very day,

Great Mars, I put myself into thy file.

Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove

A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

I would I knew in what particular action to

try him.

How now, monsieur? This

drum sticks sorely in your disposition.

Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.

Some dishonor we had in the loss of that

drum, but it is not to be recovered.

It might, but it is not now.

Why, if you have a stomach, to ’t, monsieur!

If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring

this instrument of honor again into his native

quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go

on. I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If

you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it

and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,

even to the utmost syllable of your

worthiness.

But you must not now slumber in it.

May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are

gone about it?

I know thou ’rt valiant, and to the possibility

of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

Why, do you think he will make no deed at

all of this that so seriously he does address himself

unto?

Your brother he shall go along with me.

Now will I lead you to the house and show you

The lass I spoke of.

That’s all the fault. I spoke with her but once

And found her wondrous cold. But I sent to her,

By this same coxcomb that we have i’ th’ wind,

Tokens and letters, which she did re-send.

And this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature.

Will you go see her?

They told me that your name was Fontibell.

Titled goddess,

And worth it, with addition. But, fair soul,

In your fine frame hath love no quality?

If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,

You are no maiden but a monument.

When you are dead, you should be such a one

As you are now, for you are cold and stern,

And now you should be as your mother was

When your sweet self was got.

So should you be.

No more o’ that.

I prithee do not strive against my vows.

I was compelled to her, but I love thee

By love’s own sweet constraint, and will forever

Do thee all rights of service.

How have I sworn!

Change it, change it.

Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy,

And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts

That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,

But give thyself unto my sick desires,

Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever

My love as it begins shall so persever.

I’ll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power

To give it from me.

It is an honor ’longing to our house,

Bequeathèd down from many ancestors,

Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world

In me to lose.

Here, take my ring.

My house, mine honor, yea, my life be thine,

And I’ll be bid by thee.

A heaven on Earth I have won by wooing thee.

I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses,

a month’s length apiece. By an abstract of

success: I have congeed with the Duke, done my

adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for

her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained

my convoy, and between these main parcels

of dispatch effected many nicer needs. The last

was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.

I mean the business is not ended as fearing

to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue

between the Fool and the Soldier? Come,

bring forth this counterfeit module; has deceived

me like a double-meaning prophesier.

No matter. His heels have deserved it in

usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry

himself?

Nothing of me, has he?

A plague upon him! Muffled! He can say

nothing of me.

All’s one to him. What a past-saving

slave is this!

But I con him no thanks for ’t, in the

nature he delivers it.

What shall be done to him?

Nay, by your leave, hold

your hands, though I know his brains are forfeit to

the next tile that falls.

Our interpreter does it well.

Damnable both-sides rogue!

He shall be whipped through the

army with this rhyme in ’s forehead.

I could endure anything before but a

cat, and now he’s a cat to me.

For this description of thine honesty?

A pox upon him! For me, he’s more and more

a cat.

A pox on him! He’s a cat still.

Good morrow, noble captain.

My high-repented blames,

Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

Admiringly, my liege. At first

I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart

Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;

Where the impression of mine eye infixing,

Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,

Which warped the line of every other favor,

Scorned a fair color or expressed it stol’n,

Extended or contracted all proportions

To a most hideous object. Thence it came

That she whom all men praised and whom myself,

Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye

The dust that did offend it.

Hers it was not.

My gracious sovereign,

Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,

The ring was never hers.

You are deceived, my lord. She never saw it.

In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,

Wrapped in a paper which contained the name

Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought

I stood ungaged, but when I had subscribed

To mine own fortune and informed her fully

I could not answer in that course of honor

As she had made the overture, she ceased

In heavy satisfaction and would never

Receive the ring again.

She never saw it.

If you shall prove

This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy

Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,

Where yet she never was.

My lord, I neither can nor will deny

But that I know them. Do they charge me further?

She’s none of mine, my lord.

My lord, this is a fond and desp’rate creature

Whom sometime I have laughed with. Let your Highness

Lay a more noble thought upon mine honor

Than for to think that I would sink it here.

She’s impudent, my lord,

And was a common gamester to the camp.

What of him?

He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,

With all the spots o’ th’ world taxed and debauched,

Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.

Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,

That will speak anything?

I think she has. Certain it is I liked her

And boarded her i’ th’ wanton way of youth.

She knew her distance and did angle for me,

Madding my eagerness with her restraint,

As all impediments in fancy’s course

Are motives of more fancy; and in fine

Her infinite cunning with her modern grace

Subdued me to her rate. She got the ring,

And I had that which any inferior might

At market price have bought.

I have it not.

My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

Both, both. O, pardon!

If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,

I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
