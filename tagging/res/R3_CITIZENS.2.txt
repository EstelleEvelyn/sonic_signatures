Hear you the news abroad

Ill news by 'r Lady Seldom comes the better

I fear I fear 'twill prove a giddy world

Ay sir it is too true God help the while

In him there is a hope of government

Which in his nonage council under him

And in his full and ripened years himself

No doubt shall then and till then govern well

Truly the hearts of men are full of fear

You cannot reason almost with a man

That looks not heavily and full of dread

Marry we were sent for to the Justices
