


What is Antonio here

I am sorry for thee Thou art come to answer

A stony adversary an inhuman wretch

Uncapable of pity void and empty

From any dram of mercy

Go one and call the Jew into the court

Make room and let him stand before our face

Shylock the world thinks and I think so too

That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice

To the last hour of act and then 'tis thought

Thou 'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange

Than is thy strange apparent cruelty

And where thou now exacts the penalty

Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh

Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture

But touched with humane gentleness and love

Forgive a moi'ty of the principal

Glancing an eye of pity on his losses

That have of late so huddled on his back

Enow to press a royal merchant down

And pluck commiseration of his state

From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint

From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained

To offices of tender courtesy

We all expect a gentle answer Jew

How shalt thou hope for mercy rend'ring none

Upon my power I may dismiss this court

Unless Bellario a learnd doctor

Whom I have sent for to determine this

Come here today

Bring us the letters Call the messenger

Came you from Padua from Bellario

This letter from Bellario doth commend

A young and learnd doctor to our court

Where is he

With all my heartSome three or four of you

Go give him courteous conduct to this place

Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter

Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of

your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your

messenger came in loving visitation was with me a

young doctor of Rome His name is Balthazar I

acquainted him with the cause in controversy between

the Jew and Antonio the merchant We turned o'er

many books together He is furnished with my opinion

which bettered with his own learning the greatness

whereof I cannot enough commend comes with

him at my importunity to fill up your Grace's request

in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no

impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I

never knew so young a body with so old a head I

leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial

shall better publish his commendation

You hear the learnd Bellario what he writes

And here I take it is the doctor come

Give me your hand Come you from old Bellario

You are welcome Take your place

Are you acquainted with the difference

That holds this present question in the court

Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth

That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit

I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it

For half thy wealth it is Antonio's

The other half comes to the general state

Which humbleness may drive unto a fine

He shall do this or else I do recant

The pardon that I late pronouncd here

Get thee gone but do it

Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner

I am sorry that your leisure serves you not

Antonio gratify this gentleman

For in my mind you are much bound to him
