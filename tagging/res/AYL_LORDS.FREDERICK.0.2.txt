Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing.

Hisperia, the Princess’ gentlewoman,

Confesses that she secretly o’erheard

Your daughter and her cousin much commend

The parts and graces of the wrestler

That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles,

And she believes wherever they are gone

That youth is surely in their company.
