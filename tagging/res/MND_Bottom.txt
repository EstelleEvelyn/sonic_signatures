man, according to the scrip.

First, good Peter Quince, say what the play

treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so

grow to a point.

A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a

merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your

actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

Ready. Name what part I am for, and

proceed.

What is Pyramus—a lover or a tyrant?

That will ask some tears in the true performing

of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their

eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some

measure. To the rest.—Yet my chief humor is for a

tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a

cat in, to make all split:

The raging rocks

And shivering shocks

Shall break the locks

Of prison gates.

And Phibbus’ car

Shall shine from far

And make and mar

The foolish Fates.

This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players.

This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein. A lover is more

condoling.

An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.

I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: “Thisne,

Thisne!”—“Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe

dear and lady dear!”

Well, proceed.

Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will

do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that

I will make the Duke say “Let him roar again. Let

him roar again!”

That would hang us, every mother’s son.

I grant you, friends, if you should fright the

ladies out of their wits, they would have no more

discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my

voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking

dove. I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.

Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I

best to play it in?

I will discharge it in either your straw-color

beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain

beard, or your French-crown-color beard,

your perfit yellow.

We will meet, and there we may rehearse

most obscenely and courageously. Take pains. Be

perfit. Adieu.

Enough. Hold or cut bowstrings.

Are we all met?

Peter Quince?

There are things in this comedy of Pyramus

and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus

must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies

cannot abide. How answer you that?

Not a whit! I have a device to make all well.

Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to

say we will do no harm with our swords and that

Pyramus is not killed indeed. And, for the more

better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not

Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them

out of fear.

No, make it two more. Let it be written in

eight and eight.

Masters, you ought to consider with yourself,

to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a

most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful

wildfowl than your lion living, and we ought to look

to ’t.

Nay, you must name his name, and half his

face must be seen through the lion’s neck, and he

himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the

same defect: “Ladies,” or “Fair ladies, I would

wish you,” or “I would request you,” or “I would

entreat you not to fear, not to tremble! My life for

yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were

pity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as

other men are.” And there indeed let him name his

name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.

A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac.

Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.

Why, then, may you leave a casement of the

great chamber window, where we play, open, and

the moon may shine in at the casement.

Some man or other must present Wall. And

let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some

roughcast about him to signify wall, or let him

hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall

Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.

Thisbe, the flowers of odious savors sweet—

…odors savors sweet.

So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.—

But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,

And by and by I will to thee appear.

If I were fair, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.

Why do they run away? This is a knavery of

them to make me afeard.

What do you see? You see an ass-head of your

own, do you?

I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of

me, to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir

from this place, do what they can. I will walk up

and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear

I am not afraid.

The ouzel cock, so black of hue,

With orange-tawny bill,

The throstle with his note so true,

The wren with little quill—

The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,

The plainsong cuckoo gray,

Whose note full many a man doth mark

And dares not answer “nay”—

for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a

bird? Who would give a bird the lie though he cry

“cuckoo” never so?

Methinks, mistress, you should have little

reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason

and love keep little company together nowadays.

The more the pity that some honest neighbors will

not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon

occasion.

Not so neither; but if I had wit enough to get

out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own

turn.

I cry your Worships mercy, heartily.—I beseech

your Worship’s name.

I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good

Master Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shall make

bold with you.—Your name, honest gentleman?

I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash,

your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father.

Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of

more acquaintance too.—Your name, I beseech

you, sir?

Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience

well. That same cowardly, giantlike ox-beef

hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I

promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes

water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance,

good Master Mustardseed.

Where’s Peaseblossom?

Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s

Monsieur Cobweb?

Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you

your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped

humble-bee on the top of a thistle, and, good

monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret

yourself too much in the action, monsieur, and,

good monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break

not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a

honey-bag, signior. Where’s Monsieur

Mustardseed?

Give me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed.

Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.

Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery

Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber’s,

monsieur, for methinks I am marvels hairy about

the face. And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do

but tickle me, I must scratch.

I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let’s

have the tongs and the bones.

Truly, a peck of provender. I could munch

your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire

to a bottle of hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no

fellow.

I had rather have a handful or two of dried

peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir

me; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.

 When my cue comes, call me,

and I will answer. My next is “Most fair Pyramus.”

Hey-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender!

Snout the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stolen

hence and left me asleep! I have had a most rare

vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say

what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about

to expound this dream. Methought I was—there

is no man can tell what. Methought I was and

methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if

he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of

man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen,

man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to

conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream

was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this

dream. It shall be called Bottom’s Dream because

it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the

latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure,

to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her

death.

Where are these lads? Where are these

hearts?

Masters, I am to discourse wonders. But ask

me not what; for, if I tell you, I am not true

Athenian. I will tell you everything right as it fell

out.

Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that

the Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,

good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your

pumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every man

look o’er his part. For the short and the long is, our

play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean

linen, and let not him that plays the lion pare his

nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws.

And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for

we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but

to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more

words. Away! Go, away!

O grim-looked night! O night with hue so black!

O night, which ever art when day is not!

O night! O night! Alack, alack, alack!

I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot.

And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,

That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine,

Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,

Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne.

Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this.

But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.

O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,

Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!

No, in truth, sir, he should not. “Deceiving

me” is Thisbe’s cue. She is to enter now, and I am

to spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall

pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.

I see a voice! Now will I to the chink

To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.

Thisbe?

Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace,

And, like Limander, am I trusty still.

Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.

O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.

Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?

Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.

I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,

For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,

I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.—

But stay! O spite!

But mark, poor knight,

What dreadful dole is here!

Eyes, do you see!

How can it be!

O dainty duck! O dear!

Thy mantle good—

What, stained with blood?

Approach, ye Furies fell!

O Fates, come, come,

Cut thread and thrum,

Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,

Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear,

Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame

That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer?

Come, tears, confound!

Out, sword, and wound

The pap of Pyramus;

Ay, that left pap,

Where heart doth hop.

Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.

Now am I dead;

Now am I fled;

My soul is in the sky.

Tongue, lose thy light!

Moon, take thy flight!

Now die, die, die, die, die.

No, I assure you, the wall is down that

parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the

Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between

two of our company?
