
Queen Hecuba and Helen

Up to the eastern tower

Whose height commands as subject all the vale

To see the battle Hector whose patience

Is as a virtue fixed today was moved

He chid Andromache and struck his armorer

And like as there were husbandry in war

Before the sun rose he was harnessed light

And to the field goes he where every flower

Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw

In Hector's wrath

The noise goes this there is among the Greeks

A lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hector

They call him Ajax

They say he is a very man per se

And stands alone

This man lady hath robbed many beasts

of their particular additions He is as valiant as the

lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a

man into whom nature hath so crowded humors

that his valor is crushed into folly his folly sauced

with discretion There is no man hath a virtue that

he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint

but he carries some stain of it He is melancholy

without cause and merry against the hair He hath

the joints of everything but everything so out of

joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and

no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight

They say he yesterday coped Hector in the

battle and struck him down the disdain and

shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting

and waking

Madam your Uncle Pandarus

As may be in the world lady
