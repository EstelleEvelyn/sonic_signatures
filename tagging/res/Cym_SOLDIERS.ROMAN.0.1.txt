After your will have crossed the sea attending

You here at Milford Haven with your ships

They are here in readiness

The Senate hath stirred up the confiners

And gentlemen of Italy most willing spirits

That promise noble service and they come

Under the conduct of bold Iachimo

Siena's brother

With the next benefit o' th' wind

He's alive my lord
