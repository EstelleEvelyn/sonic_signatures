


You come hither my lord to marry

this lady

Lady you come hither to be married to this

count

If either of you know any inward impediment

why you should not be conjoined I charge you on

your souls to utter it

Know you any count

Have comfort lady

Yea wherefore should she not

Hear me a little

For I have only silent been so long

And given way unto this course of fortune

By noting of the lady I have marked

A thousand blushing apparitions

To start into her face a thousand innocent shames

In angel whiteness beat away those blushes

And in her eye there hath appeared a fire

To burn the errors that these princes hold

Against her maiden truth Call me a fool

Trust not my reading nor my observations

Which with experimental seal doth warrant

The tenor of my book trust not my age

My reverence calling nor divinity

If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here

Under some biting error

Lady what man is he you are accused of

There is some strange misprision in the princes

Pause awhile

And let my counsel sway you in this case

Your daughter here the princes left for dead

Let her awhile be secretly kept in

And publish it that she is dead indeed

Maintain a mourning ostentation

And on your family's old monument

Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites

That appertain unto a burial

Marry this well carried shall on her behalf

Change slander to remorse That is some good

But not for that dream I on this strange course

But on this travail look for greater birth

She dying as it must be so maintained

Upon the instant that she was accused

Shall be lamented pitied and excused

Of every hearer For it so falls out

That what we have we prize not to the worth

Whiles we enjoy it but being lacked and lost

Why then we rack the value then we find

The virtue that possession would not show us

Whiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio

When he shall hear she died upon his words

Th' idea of her life shall sweetly creep

Into his study of imagination

And every lovely organ of her life

Shall come appareled in more precious habit

More moving delicate and full of life

Into the eye and prospect of his soul

Than when she lived indeed Then shall he mourn

If ever love had interest in his liver

And wish he had not so accused her

No though he thought his accusation true

Let this be so and doubt not but success

Will fashion the event in better shape

Than I can lay it down in likelihood

But if all aim but this be leveled false

The supposition of the lady's death

Will quench the wonder of her infamy

And if it sort not well you may conceal her

As best befits her wounded reputation

In some reclusive and religious life

Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries

'Tis well consented Presently away

For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure

Come lady die to live This wedding day

Perhaps is but prolonged Have patience and endure

Did I not tell you she was innocent

To do what signior

And my help

Here comes the Prince and Claudio

All this amazement can I qualify

When after that the holy rites are ended

I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death

Meantime let wonder seem familiar

And to the chapel let us presently
