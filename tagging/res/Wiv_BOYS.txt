


Fie on sinful fantasy

Fie on lust and luxury

Lust is but a bloody fire

Kindled with unchaste desire

Fed in heart whose flames aspire

As thoughts do blow them higher and higher

Pinch him fairies mutually

Pinch him for his villainy

Pinch him and burn him and turn him about

Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out
