


Who were those went by

And whither go they

What was his cause of anger

Good and what of him

So do all men unless they are drunk sick

or have no legs

But how should this man that makes me

smile make Hector angry

Who comes here

Hector's a gallant man

Good morrow Uncle Pandarus

This morning uncle

Hector was gone but Helen was not up

That were we talking of and of his anger

So he says here

What is he angry too

O Jupiter there's no comparison

Ay if I ever saw him before and knew him

Then you say as I say for I am sure he is not

Hector

'Tis just to each of them he is himself

So he is

He is not Hector

Excuse me

Pardon me pardon me

He shall not need it if he have his own

No matter

'Twould not become him His own 's better

No but brown

To say the truth true and not true

Why Paris hath color enough

Then Troilus should have too much If she

praised him above his complexion is higher than

his He having color enough and the other higher

is too flaming a praise for a good complexion I

had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended

Troilus for a copper nose

Then she's a merry Greek indeed

Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring

his particulars therein to a total

Is he so young a man and so old a lifter

Juno have mercy How came it cloven

O he smiles valiantly

O yes an 'twere a cloud in autumn

Troilus will stand to the proof if you'll

prove it so

If you love an addle egg as well as you love

an idle head you would eat chickens i' th' shell

Without the rack

Alas poor chin Many a wart is richer

With millstones

But there was a more temperate fire under

the pot of her eyes Did her eyes run o'er too

At what was all this laughing

An 't had been a green hair I should have

laughed too

What was his answer

This is her question

So let it now for it has been a great while

going by

So I do

And I'll spring up in his tears an 'twere a nettle

against May

At your pleasure

Speak not so loud

Who's that

Will he give you the nod

If he do the rich shall have more

O a brave man

Be those with swords

Who's that

Can Helenus fight uncle

What sneaking fellow comes yonder

Peace for shame peace

Here comes more

There is amongst the Greeks Achilles a better

man than Troilus

Well well

Ay a minced man and then to be baked with

no date in the pie for then the man's date is out

Upon my back to defend my belly upon my

wit to defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend

mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and

you to defend all these and at all these wards I lie

at a thousand watches

Nay I'll watch you for that and that's one of

the chiefest of them too If I cannot ward what I

would not have hit I can watch you for telling how

I took the blowunless it swell past hiding and

then it's past watching

Adieu uncle

To bring uncle

By the same token you are a bawd

Words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice

He offers in another's enterprise

But more in Troilus thousandfold I see

Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be

Yet hold I off Women are angels wooing

Things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing

That she beloved knows naught that knows not this

Men prize the thing ungained more than it is

That she was never yet that ever knew

Love got so sweet as when desire did sue

Therefore this maxim out of love I teach

Achievement is command ungained beseech

Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear

Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear

Will you walk in my lord

Wished my lord The gods grantO my

lord

More dregs than water if my fears have eyes

Blind fear that seeing reason leads finds

safer footing than blind reason stumbling without

fear To fear the worst oft cures the worse

Nor nothing monstrous neither

They say all lovers swear more performance

than they are able and yet reserve an ability that

they never perform vowing more than the perfection

of ten and discharging less than the tenth part

of one They that have the voice of lions and the

act of hares are they not monsters

Will you walk in my lord

Well uncle what folly I commit I dedicate

to you

Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart

Prince Troilus I have loved you night and day

For many weary months

Hard to seem won but I was won my lord

With the first glance that everpardon me

If I confess much you will play the tyrant

I love you now but till now not so much

But I might master it In faith I lie

My thoughts were like unbridled children grown

Too headstrong for their mother See we fools

Why have I blabbed Who shall be true to us

When we are so unsecret to ourselves

But though I loved you well I wooed you not

And yet good faith I wished myself a man

Or that we women had men's privilege

Of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue

For in this rapture I shall surely speak

The thing I shall repent See see your silence

Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws

My very soul of counsel Stop my mouth

My lord I do beseech you pardon me

'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss

I am ashamed O heavens what have I done

For this time will I take my leave my lord

Pray you content you

Sir mine own company

Let me go and try

I have a kind of self resides with you

But an unkind self that itself will leave

To be another's fool I would be gone

Where is my wit I know not what I speak

Perchance my lord I show more craft than love

And fell so roundly to a large confession

To angle for your thoughts But you are wise

Or else you love not for to be wise and love

Exceeds man's might That dwells with gods above

In that I'll war with you

Prophet may you be

If I be false or swerve a hair from truth

When time is old and hath forgot itself

When water drops have worn the stones of Troy

And blind oblivion swallowed cities up

And mighty states characterless are grated

To dusty nothing yet let memory

From false to false among false maids in love

Upbraid my falsehood When they've said as false

As air as water wind or sandy earth

As fox to lamb or wolf to heifer's calf

Pard to the hind or stepdame to her son

Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood

As false as Cressid

Amen

Then sweet my lord I'll call mine uncle down

He shall unbolt the gates

Good morrow then

Are you aweary of me

Night hath been too brief

Prithee tarry You men will never tarry

O foolish Cressid I might have still held off

And then you would have tarried Hark there's one up

A pestilence on him Now will he be mocking

I shall have such a life

Go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle

You bring me to doand then you flout me too

Come come beshrew your heart You'll ne'er be good

Nor suffer others

Did not I tell you Would he were knocked i' th' head

Who's that at doorGood uncle go and see

My lord come you again into my chamber

You smile and mock me as if I meant naughtily

Come you are deceived I think of no such thing

How earnestly they knock Pray you come in

I would not for half Troy have you seen here

How now What's the matter Who was here

Why sigh you so profoundly Where's my lord

Gone Tell me sweet uncle what's the matter

O the gods What's the matter

Good uncle I beseech you on my knees I

beseech you what's the matter

O you immortal gods I will not go

I will not uncle I have forgot my father

I know no touch of consanguinity

No kin no love no blood no soul so near me

As the sweet Troilus O you gods divine

Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood

If ever she leave Troilus Time force and death

Do to this body what extremes you can

But the strong base and building of my love

Is as the very center of the Earth

Drawing all things to it I'll go in and weep

Tear my bright hair and scratch my praisd cheeks

Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart

With sounding Troilus I will not go from Troy

Why tell you me of moderation

The grief is fine full perfect that I taste

And violenteth in a sense as strong

As that which causeth it How can I moderate it

If I could temporize with my affection

Or brew it to a weak and colder palate

The like allayment could I give my grief

My love admits no qualifying dross

No more my grief in such a precious loss

O Troilus Troilus

Have the gods envy

And is it true that I must go from Troy

What and from Troilus too

Is 't possible

I must then to the Grecians

A woeful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks

When shall we see again

I true How now what wicked deem is this

O you shall be exposed my lord to dangers

As infinite as imminent But I'll be true

And you this glove When shall I see you

O heavens Be true again

O heavens you love me not

Do you think I will

My lord will you be true

In kissing do you render or receive

I'll make my match to live

The kiss you take is better than you give

Therefore no kiss

You are an odd man Give even or give none

No Paris is not for you know 'tis true

That you are odd and he is even with you

No I'll be sworn

You may

Why beg two

I am your debtor claim it when 'tis due

Now my sweet guardian Hark a word with you

Remember Yes

Sweet honey Greek tempt me no more to folly

I'll tell you what

In faith I cannot What would you have me do

I prithee do not hold me to mine oath

Bid me do anything but that sweet Greek

Diomed

Hark a word in your ear

Nay but you part in anger

Guardian Why Greek

In faith I do not Come hither once again

In faith I will la Never trust me else

I'll fetch you one

Here Diomed Keep this sleeve

You look upon that sleeve Behold it well

He loved meO false wenchGive 't me again

It is no matter now I ha 't again

I will not meet with you tomorrow night

I prithee Diomed visit me no more

What this

O all you godsO pretty pretty pledge

Thy master now lies thinking on his bed

Of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove

And gives memorial dainty kisses to it

As I kiss thee

He that takes that doth take my heart withal

You shall not have it Diomed faith you shall not

I'll give you something else

It is no matter

'Twas one's that loved me better than you will

But now you have it take it

By all Diana's waiting-women yond

And by herself I will not tell you whose

Well well 'tis done 'tis past And yet it is not

I will not keep my word

You shall not go One cannot speak a word

But it straight starts you

Ay comeO JoveDo comeI shall be plagued

Good night I prithee come

Troilus farewell One eye yet looks on thee

But with my heart the other eye doth see

Ah poor our sex This fault in us I find

The error of our eye directs our mind

What error leads must err O then conclude

Minds swayed by eyes are full of turpitude
