


Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

The memory be green and that it us befitted

To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom

To be contracted in one brow of woe

Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

That we with wisest sorrow think on him

Together with remembrance of ourselves

Therefore our sometime sister now our queen

Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state

Have we as 'twere with a defeated joy

With an auspicious and a dropping eye

With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage

In equal scale weighing delight and dole

Taken to wife Nor have we herein barred

Your better wisdoms which have freely gone

With this affair along For all our thanks

Now follows that you know Young Fortinbras

Holding a weak supposal of our worth

Or thinking by our late dear brother's death

Our state to be disjoint and out of frame

Colleagud with this dream of his advantage

He hath not failed to pester us with message

Importing the surrender of those lands

Lost by his father with all bonds of law

To our most valiant brotherso much for him

Now for ourself and for this time of meeting

Thus much the business is we have here writ

To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras

Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears

Of this his nephew's purpose to suppress

His further gait herein in that the levies

The lists and full proportions are all made

Out of his subject and we here dispatch

You good Cornelius and you Voltemand

For bearers of this greeting to old Norway

Giving to you no further personal power

To business with the King more than the scope

Of these dilated articles allow

Farewell and let your haste commend your duty

We doubt it nothing Heartily farewell

And now Laertes what's the news with you

You told us of some suit What is 't Laertes

You cannot speak of reason to the Dane

And lose your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes

That shall not be my offer not thy asking

The head is not more native to the heart

The hand more instrumental to the mouth

Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father

What wouldst thou have Laertes

Have you your father's leave What says Polonius

Take thy fair hour Laertes Time be thine

And thy best graces spend it at thy will

But now my cousin Hamlet and my son

How is it that the clouds still hang on you

'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet

To give these mourning duties to your father

But you must know your father lost a father

That father lost lost his and the survivor bound

In filial obligation for some term

To do obsequious sorrow But to persever

In obstinate condolement is a course

Of impious stubbornness 'Tis unmanly grief

It shows a will most incorrect to heaven

A heart unfortified a mind impatient

An understanding simple and unschooled

For what we know must be and is as common

As any the most vulgar thing to sense

Why should we in our peevish opposition

Take it to heart Fie 'tis a fault to heaven

A fault against the dead a fault to nature

To reason most absurd whose common theme

Is death of fathers and who still hath cried

From the first corse till he that died today

This must be so We pray you throw to earth

This unprevailing woe and think of us

As of a father for let the world take note

You are the most immediate to our throne

And with no less nobility of love

Than that which dearest father bears his son

Do I impart toward you For your intent

In going back to school in Wittenberg

It is most retrograde to our desire

And we beseech you bend you to remain

Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye

Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son

Why 'tis a loving and a fair reply

Be as ourself in DenmarkMadam come

This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet

Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof

No jocund health that Denmark drinks today

But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell

And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again

Respeaking earthly thunder Come away

Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

Moreover that we much did long to see you

The need we have to use you did provoke

Our hasty sending Something have you heard

Of Hamlet's transformation so call it

Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man

Resembles that it was What it should be

More than his father's death that thus hath put him

So much from th' understanding of himself

I cannot dream of I entreat you both

That being of so young days brought up with him

And sith so neighbored to his youth and havior

That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court

Some little time so by your companies

To draw him on to pleasures and to gather

So much as from occasion you may glean

Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus

That opened lies within our remedy

Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern

Thou still hast been the father of good news

O speak of that That do I long to hear

Thyself do grace to them and bring them in

He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found

The head and source of all your son's distemper

Well we shall sift him    Welcome my good friends

Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway

It likes us well

And at our more considered time we'll read

Answer and think upon this business

Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor

Go to your rest At night we'll feast together

Most welcome home

But how hath she received his love

As of a man faithful and honorable

Do you think 'tis this

Not that I know

How may we try it further

We will try it

And can you by no drift of conference

Get from him why he puts on this confusion

Grating so harshly all his days of quiet

With turbulent and dangerous lunacy

With all my heart and it doth much content me

To hear him so inclined

Good gentlemen give him a further edge

And drive his purpose into these delights

Sweet Gertrude leave us too

For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither

That he as 'twere by accident may here

Affront Ophelia

Her father and myself lawful espials

Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen

We may of their encounter frankly judge

And gather by him as he is behaved

If 't be th' affliction of his love or no

That thus he suffers for

O 'tis too true

How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience

The harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art

Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

Than is my deed to my most painted word

O heavy burden

Love His affections do not that way tend

Nor what he spake though it lacked form a little

Was not like madness There's something in his soul

O'er which his melancholy sits on brood

And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose

Will be some danger which for to prevent

I have in quick determination

Thus set it down he shall with speed to England

For the demand of our neglected tribute

Haply the seas and countries different

With variable objects shall expel

This something-settled matter in his heart

Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus

From fashion of himself What think you on 't

It shall be so

Madness in great ones must not unwatched go

How fares our cousin Hamlet

I have nothing with this answer Hamlet These

words are not mine

Have you heard the argument Is there no

offense in 't

What do you call the play

Give me some light Away

I like him not nor stands it safe with us

To let his madness range Therefore prepare you

I your commission will forthwith dispatch

And he to England shall along with you

The terms of our estate may not endure

Hazard so near 's as doth hourly grow

Out of his brows

Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage

For we will fetters put about this fear

Which now goes too free-footed

Thanks dear my lord

O my offense is rank it smells to heaven

It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't

A brother's murder Pray can I not

Though inclination be as sharp as will

My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent

And like a man to double business bound

I stand in pause where I shall first begin

And both neglect What if this cursd hand

Were thicker than itself with brother's blood

Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens

To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy

But to confront the visage of offense

And what's in prayer but this twofold force

To be forestalld ere we come to fall

Or pardoned being down Then I'll look up

My fault is past But O what form of prayer

Can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder

That cannot be since I am still possessed

Of those effects for which I did the murder

My crown mine own ambition and my queen

May one be pardoned and retain th' offense

In the corrupted currents of this world

Offense's gilded hand may shove by justice

And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself

Buys out the law But 'tis not so above

There is no shuffling there the action lies

In his true nature and we ourselves compelled

Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults

To give in evidence What then What rests

Try what repentance can What can it not

Yet what can it when one cannot repent

O wretched state O bosom black as death

O limd soul that struggling to be free

Art more engaged Help angels Make assay

Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel

Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe

All may be well

My words fly up my thoughts remain below

Words without thoughts never to heaven go

There's matter in these sighs these profound heaves

You must translate 'tis fit we understand them

Where is your son

What Gertrude How does Hamlet

O heavy deed

It had been so with us had we been there

His liberty is full of threats to all

To you yourself to us to everyone

Alas how shall this bloody deed be answered

It will be laid to us whose providence

Should have kept short restrained and out of haunt

This mad young man But so much was our love

We would not understand what was most fit

But like the owner of a foul disease

To keep it from divulging let it feed

Even on the pith of life Where is he gone

O Gertrude come away

The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch

But we will ship him hence and this vile deed

We must with all our majesty and skill

Both countenance and excuseHo Guildenstern

Friends both go join you with some further aid

Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain

And from his mother's closet hath he dragged him

Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body

Into the chapel I pray you haste in this

Come Gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends

And let them know both what we mean to do

And what's untimely done

Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter

As level as the cannon to his blank

Transports his poisoned shot may miss our name

And hit the woundless air O come away

My soul is full of discord and dismay

I have sent to seek him and to find the body

How dangerous is it that this man goes loose

Yet must not we put the strong law on him

He's loved of the distracted multitude

Who like not in their judgment but their eyes

And where 'tis so th' offender's scourge is weighed

But never the offense To bear all smooth and even

This sudden sending him away must seem

Deliberate pause Diseases desperate grown

By desperate appliance are relieved

Or not at all    How now what hath befallen

But where is he

Bring him before us

Now Hamlet where's Polonius

At supper where

Alas alas

What dost thou mean by this

Where is Polonius

Go seek him there

Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety

Which we do tender as we dearly grieve

For that which thou hast done must send thee hence

With fiery quickness Therefore prepare thyself

The bark is ready and the wind at help

Th' associates tend and everything is bent

For England

Ay Hamlet

So is it if thou knew'st our purposes

Thy loving father Hamlet

Follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard

Delay it not I'll have him hence tonight

Away for everything is sealed and done

That else leans on th' affair Pray you make haste

And England if my love thou hold'st at aught

As my great power thereof may give thee sense

Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red

After the Danish sword and thy free awe

Pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set

Our sovereign process which imports at full

By letters congruing to that effect

The present death of Hamlet Do it England

For like the hectic in my blood he rages

And thou must cure me Till I know 'tis done

Howe'er my haps my joys will ne'er begin

How do you pretty lady

Conceit upon her father

Pretty Ophelia

How long hath she been thus

Follow her close give her good watch I pray you

O this is the poison of deep grief It springs

All from her father's death and now behold

O Gertrude Gertrude

When sorrows come they come not single spies

But in battalions first her father slain

Next your son gone and he most violent author

Of his own just remove the people muddied

Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers

For good Polonius' death and we have done but greenly

In hugger-mugger to inter him poor Ophelia

Divided from herself and her fair judgment

Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts

Last and as much containing as all these

Her brother is in secret come from France

Feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds

And wants not buzzers to infect his ear

With pestilent speeches of his father's death

Wherein necessity of matter beggared

Will nothing stick our person to arraign

In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this

Like to a murd'ring piece in many places

Gives me superfluous death

Attend

Where is my Switzers Let them guard the door

What is the matter

The doors are broke

What is the cause Laertes

That thy rebellion looks so giant-like

Let him go Gertrude Do not fear our person

There's such divinity doth hedge a king

That treason can but peep to what it would

Acts little of his willTell me Laertes

Why thou art thus incensedLet him go Gertrude

Speak man

Dead

Let him demand his fill

Who shall stay you

Good Laertes

If you desire to know the certainty

Of your dear father is 't writ in your revenge

That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe

Winner and loser

Will you know them then

Why now you speak

Like a good child and a true gentleman

That I am guiltless of your father's death

And am most sensibly in grief for it

It shall as level to your judgment 'pear

As day does to your eye

Laertes I must commune with your grief

Or you deny me right Go but apart

Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will

And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me

If by direct or by collateral hand

They find us touched we will our kingdom give

Our crown our life and all that we call ours

To you in satisfaction but if not

Be you content to lend your patience to us

And we shall jointly labor with your soul

To give it due content

So you shall

And where th' offense is let the great ax fall

I pray you go with me

Now must your conscience my acquittance seal

And you must put me in your heart for friend

Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear

That he which hath your noble father slain

Pursued my life

O for two special reasons

Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed

But yet to me they're strong The Queen his mother

Lives almost by his looks and for myself

My virtue or my plague be it either which

She is so conjunctive to my life and soul

That as the star moves not but in his sphere

I could not but by her The other motive

Why to a public count I might not go

Is the great love the general gender bear him

Who dipping all his faults in their affection

Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone

Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows

Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind

Would have reverted to my bow again

But not where I have aimed them

Break not your sleeps for that You must not think

That we are made of stuff so flat and dull

That we can let our beard be shook with danger

And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more

I loved your father and we love ourself

And that I hope will teach you to imagine

How now What news

From Hamlet Who brought them

Laertes you shall hear them

Leave us

High and mighty you shall know I am set

naked on your kingdom Tomorrow shall I beg leave to

see your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your

pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden

and more strange return Hamlet

What should this mean Are all the rest come back

Or is it some abuse and no such thing

'Tis Hamlet's character Naked

And in a postscript here he says alone

Can you advise me

If it be so Laertes

As how should it be so how otherwise

Will you be ruled by me

To thine own peace If he be now returned

As checking at his voyage and that he means

No more to undertake it I will work him

To an exploit now ripe in my device

Under the which he shall not choose but fall

And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe

But even his mother shall uncharge the practice

And call it accident

It falls right

You have been talked of since your travel much

And that in Hamlet's hearing for a quality

Wherein they say you shine Your sum of parts

Did not together pluck such envy from him

As did that one and that in my regard

Of the unworthiest siege

A very ribbon in the cap of youth

Yet needful too for youth no less becomes

The light and careless livery that it wears

Than settled age his sables and his weeds

Importing health and graveness Two months since

Here was a gentleman of Normandy

I have seen myself and served against the French

And they can well on horseback but this gallant

Had witchcraft in 't He grew unto his seat

And to such wondrous doing brought his horse

As had he been encorpsed and demi-natured

With the brave beast So far he topped my thought

That I in forgery of shapes and tricks

Come short of what he did

A Norman

The very same

He made confession of you

And gave you such a masterly report

For art and exercise in your defense

And for your rapier most especial

That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed

If one could match you The 'scrimers of their nation

He swore had neither motion guard nor eye

If you opposed them Sir this report of his

Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy

That he could nothing do but wish and beg

Your sudden coming-o'er to play with you

Now out of this

Laertes was your father dear to you

Or are you like the painting of a sorrow

A face without a heart

Not that I think you did not love your father

But that I know love is begun by time

And that I see in passages of proof

Time qualifies the spark and fire of it

There lives within the very flame of love

A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it

And nothing is at a like goodness still

For goodness growing to a pleurisy

Dies in his own too-much That we would do

We should do when we would for this would changes

And hath abatements and delays as many

As there are tongues are hands are accidents

And then this should is like a spendthrift sigh

That hurts by easing But to the quick of th' ulcer

Hamlet comes back what would you undertake

To show yourself indeed your father's son

More than in words

No place indeed should murder sanctuarize

Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes

Will you do this Keep close within your chamber

Hamlet returned shall know you are come home

We'll put on those shall praise your excellence

And set a double varnish on the fame

The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together

And wager on your heads He being remiss

Most generous and free from all contriving

Will not peruse the foils so that with ease

Or with a little shuffling you may choose

A sword unbated and in a pass of practice

Requite him for your father

Let's further think of this

Weigh what convenience both of time and means

May fit us to our shape If this should fail

And that our drift look through our bad performance

'Twere better not assayed Therefore this project

Should have a back or second that might hold

If this did blast in proof Soft let me see

We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings

I ha 't

When in your motion you are hot and dry

As make your bouts more violent to that end

And that he calls for drink I'll have prepared him

A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping

If he by chance escape your venomed stuck

Our purpose may hold thereBut stay what noise

Let's follow Gertrude

How much I had to do to calm his rage

Now fear I this will give it start again

Therefore let's follow

Pluck them asunder

O he is mad Laertes

I pray thee good Horatio wait upon him

Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech

We'll put the matter to the present push

Good Gertrude set some watch over your son

This grave shall have a living monument

An hour of quiet thereby shall we see

Till then in patience our proceeding be

Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me

Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet

You know the wager

I do not fear it I have seen you both

But since he is better we have therefore odds

Set me the stoups of wine upon that table

If Hamlet give the first or second hit

Or quit in answer of the third exchange

Let all the battlements their ordnance fire

The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath

And in the cup an union shall he throw

Richer than that which four successive kings

In Denmark's crown have worn Give me the cups

And let the kettle to the trumpet speak

The trumpet to the cannoneer without

The cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth

Now the King drinks to Hamlet Come begin

And you the judges bear a wary eye

Stay give me drinkHamlet this pearl is thine

Here's to thy health   Give him the cup

Our son shall win

Gertrude do not drink

It is the poisoned cup It is too late

I do not think 't

Part them They are incensed

She swoons to see them bleed

O yet defend me friends I am but hurt
