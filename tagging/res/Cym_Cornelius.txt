


Pleaseth your Highness ay Here they are madam

But I beseech your Grace without offense

My conscience bids me askwherefore you have

Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds

Which are the movers of a languishing death

But though slow deadly

Your Highness

Shall from this practice but make hard your heart

Besides the seeing these effects will be

Both noisome and infectious

I do suspect you madam

But you shall do no harm

I do not like her She doth think she has

Strange ling'ring poisons I do know her spirit

And will not trust one of her malice with

A drug of such damned nature Those she has

Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile

Which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs

Then afterward up higher But there is

No danger in what show of death it makes

More than the locking-up the spirits a time

To be more fresh reviving She is fooled

With a most false effect and I the truer

So to be false with her

I humbly take my leave

Hail great king

To sour your happiness I must report

The Queen is dead

With horror madly dying like her life

Which being cruel to the world concluded

Most cruel to herself What she confessed

I will report so please you These her women

Can trip me if I err who with wet cheeks

Were present when she finished

First she confessed she never loved you only

Affected greatness got by you not you

Married your royalty was wife to your place

Abhorred your person

Your daughter whom she bore in hand to love

With such integrity she did confess

Was as a scorpion to her sight whose life

But that her flight prevented it she had

Ta'en off by poison

More sir and worse She did confess she had

For you a mortal mineral which being took

Should by the minute feed on life and ling'ring

By inches waste you In which time she purposed

By watching weeping tendance kissing to

O'ercome you with her show and in time

When she had fitted you with her craft to work

Her son into th' adoption of the crown

But failing of her end by his strange absence

Grew shameless desperate opened in despite

Of heaven and men her purposes repented

The evils she hatched were not effected so

Despairing died

O gods

I left out one thing which the Queen confessed

Which must approve thee honest If Pisanio

Have said she given his mistress that confection

Which I gave him for cordial she is served

As I would serve a rat

The Queen sir very oft importuned me

To temper poisons for her still pretending

The satisfaction of her knowledge only

In killing creatures vile as cats and dogs

Of no esteem I dreading that her purpose

Was of more danger did compound for her

A certain stuff which being ta'en would cease

The present power of life but in short time

All offices of nature should again

Do their due functionsHave you ta'en of it

By the Queen's dram she swallowed
