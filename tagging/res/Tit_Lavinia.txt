My noble lord and father, live in fame.

Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears

I render for my brethren’s obsequies,

And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy

Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.

O bless me here with thy victorious hand,

Whose fortunes Rome’s best citizens applaud.

Not I, my lord, sith true nobility

Warrants these words in princely courtesy.

I say no.

I have been broad awake two hours and more.

Under your patience, gentle empress,

’Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,

And to be doubted that your Moor and you

Are singled forth to try experiments.

Jove shield your husband from his hounds today!

’Tis pity they should take him for a stag.

And being intercepted in your sport,

Great reason that my noble lord be rated

For sauciness.—I pray you, let us hence,

And let her joy her raven-colored love.

This valley fits the purpose passing well.

Ay, for these slips have made him noted long.

Good king to be so mightily abused!

Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,

For no name fits thy nature but thy own!

O Tamora, thou bearest a woman’s face—

Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.

When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam?

O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee.

The milk thou suck’st from her did turn to marble.

Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.

Yet every mother breeds not sons alike.

Do thou entreat her show a woman’s pity.

’Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark.

Yet have I heard—O, could I find it now!—

The lion, moved with pity, did endure

To have his princely paws pared all away.

Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,

The whilst their own birds famish in their nests.

O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,

Nothing so kind, but something pitiful.

O, let me teach thee! For my father’s sake,

That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,

Be not obdurate; open thy deaf ears.

O Tamora, be called a gentle queen,

And with thine own hands kill me in this place!

For ’tis not life that I have begged so long;

Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.

’Tis present death I beg, and one thing more

That womanhood denies my tongue to tell.

O, keep me from their worse-than-killing lust,

And tumble me into some loathsome pit

Where never man’s eye may behold my body.

Do this, and be a charitable murderer.

No grace, no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,

The blot and enemy to our general name,

Confusion fall—
