


My lords look where the sturdy rebel sits

Even in the chair of state Belike he means

Backed by the power of Warwick that false peer

To aspire unto the crown and reign as king

Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father

And thine Lord Clifford and you both have vowed revenge

On him his sons his favorites and his friends

Be patient gentle Earl of Westmorland

Ah know you not the city favors them

And they have troops of soldiers at their beck

Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart

To make a shambles of the Parliament House

Cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats

Shall be the war that Henry means to use

Thou factious Duke of York descend my throne

And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet

I am thy sovereign

And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne

What title hast thou traitor to the crown

Thy father was as thou art Duke of York

Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March

I am the son of Henry the Fifth

Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop

And seized upon their towns and provinces

The Lord Protector lost it and not I

When I was crowned I was but nine months old

Peace thou and give King Henry leave to speak

Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne

Wherein my grandsire and my father sat

No First shall war unpeople this my realm

Ay and their colors often borne in France

And now in England to our heart's great sorrow

Shall be my winding-sheet Why faint you lords

My title's good and better far than his

Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown

I know not what to say my title's weak

Tell me may not a king adopt an heir

An if he may then am I lawful king

For Richard in the view of many lords

Resigned the crown to Henry the Fourth

Whose heir my father was and I am his

Art thou against us Duke of Exeter

All will revolt from me and turn to him

O Clifford how thy words revive my heart

My lord of Warwick hear but one word

Let me for this my lifetime reign as king

I am content Richard Plantagenet

Enjoy the kingdom after my decease

Ah Exeter

Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son

Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit

But be it as it may I here entail

The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever

Conditionally that here thou take an oath

To cease this civil war and whilst I live

To honor me as thy king and sovereign

And neither by treason nor hostility

To seek to put me down and reign thyself

And long live thou and these thy forward sons

And I with grief and sorrow to the court

Exeter so will I

Be patient gentle queen and I will stay

Pardon me MargaretPardon me sweet son

The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforced me

Stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak

Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me

Poor queen How love to me and to her son

Hath made her break out into terms of rage

Revenged may she be on that hateful duke

Whose haughty spirit wingd with desire

Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle

Tire on the flesh of me and of my son

The loss of those three lords torments my heart

I'll write unto them and entreat them fair

Come cousin you shall be the messenger

Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack

To see this sight it irks my very soul

Withhold revenge dear God 'Tis not my fault

Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow

Full well hath Clifford played the orator

Inferring arguments of mighty force

But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear

That things ill got had ever bad success

And happy always was it for that son

Whose father for his hoarding went to hell

I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind

And would my father had left me no more

For all the rest is held at such a rate

As brings a thousandfold more care to keep

Than in possession any jot of pleasure

Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know

How it doth grieve me that thy head is here

Edward Plantagenet arise a knight

And learn this lesson draw thy sword in right

Why that's my fortune too therefore I'll stay

Have done with words my lords and hear me speak

I prithee give no limits to my tongue

I am a king and privileged to speak

This battle fares like to the morning's war

When dying clouds contend with growing light

What time the shepherd blowing of his nails

Can neither call it perfect day nor night

Now sways it this way like a mighty sea

Forced by the tide to combat with the wind

Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea

Forced to retire by fury of the wind

Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind

Now one the better then another best

Both tugging to be victors breast to breast

Yet neither conqueror nor conquerd

So is the equal poise of this fell war

Here on this molehill will I sit me down

To whom God will there be the victory

For Margaret my queen and Clifford too

Have chid me from the battle swearing both

They prosper best of all when I am thence

Would I were dead if God's good will were so

For what is in this world but grief and woe

O God Methinks it were a happy life

To be no better than a homely swain

To sit upon a hill as I do now

To carve out dials quaintly point by point

Thereby to see the minutes how they run

How many makes the hour full complete

How many hours brings about the day

How many days will finish up the year

How many years a mortal man may live

When this is known then to divide the times

So many hours must I tend my flock

So many hours must I take my rest

So many hours must I contemplate

So many hours must I sport myself

So many days my ewes have been with young

So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean

So many years ere I shall shear the fleece

So minutes hours days months and years

Passed over to the end they were created

Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave

Ah what a life were this How sweet how lovely

Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade

To shepherds looking on their silly sheep

Than doth a rich embroidered canopy

To kings that fear their subjects' treachery

O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth

And to conclude the shepherd's homely curds

His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle

His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade

All which secure and sweetly he enjoys

Is far beyond a prince's delicates

His viands sparkling in a golden cup

His body couchd in a curious bed

When care mistrust and treason waits on him

O piteous spectacle O bloody times

Whiles lions war and battle for their dens

Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity

Weep wretched man I'll aid thee tear for tear

And let our hearts and eyes like civil war

Be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief

Woe above woe grief more than common grief

O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds

O pity pity gentle heaven pity

The red rose and the white are on his face

The fatal colors of our striving houses

The one his purple blood right well resembles

The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth

Wither one rose and let the other flourish

If you contend a thousand lives must wither

How will the country for these woeful chances

Misthink the King and not be satisfied

Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe

Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much

Sad-hearted men much overgone with care

Here sits a king more woeful than you are

Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter

Not that I fear to stay but love to go

Whither the Queen intends Forward away

From Scotland am I stol'n even of pure love

To greet mine own land with my wishful sight

No Harry Harry 'tis no land of thine

Thy place is filled thy scepter wrung from thee

Thy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed

No bending knee will call thee Caesar now

No humble suitors press to speak for right

No not a man comes for redress of thee

For how can I help them an not myself

Let me embrace the sour adversaries

For wise men say it is the wisest course

My queen and son are gone to France for aid

And as I hear the great commanding Warwick

Is thither gone to crave the French king's sister

To wife for Edward If this news be true

Poor queen and son your labor is but lost

For Warwick is a subtle orator

And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words

By this account then Margaret may win him

For she's a woman to be pitied much

Her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast

Her tears will pierce into a marble heart

The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn

And Nero will be tainted with remorse

To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears

Ay but she's come to beg Warwick to give

She on his left side craving aid for Henry

He on his right asking a wife for Edward

She weeps and says her Henry is deposed

He smiles and says his Edward is installed

That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more

Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong

Inferreth arguments of mighty strength

And in conclusion wins the King from her

With promise of his sister and what else

To strengthen and support King Edward's place

O Margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul

Art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn

More than I seem and less than I was born to

A man at least for less I should not be

And men may talk of kings and why not I

Why so I am in mind and that's enough

My crown is in my heart not on my head

Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones

Nor to be seen My crown is called content

A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy

But did you never swear and break an oath

Where did you dwell when I was King of England

I was anointed king at nine months old

My father and my grandfather were kings

And you were sworn true subjects unto me

And tell me then have you not broke your oaths

Why am I dead Do I not breathe a man

Ah simple men you know not what you swear

Look as I blow this feather from my face

And as the air blows it to me again

Obeying with my wind when I do blow

And yielding to another when it blows

Commanded always by the greater gust

Such is the lightness of you common men

But do not break your oaths for of that sin

My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty

Go where you will the King shall be commanded

And be you kings command and I'll obey

So would you be again to Henry

If he were seated as King Edward is

In God's name lead Your king's name be obeyed

And what God will that let your king perform

And what he will I humbly yield unto

Master lieutenant now that God and friends

Have shaken Edward from the regal seat

And turned my captive state to liberty

My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys

At our enlargement what are thy due fees

For what lieutenant For well using me

Nay be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness

For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure

Ay such a pleasure as encagd birds

Conceive when after many moody thoughts

At last by notes of household harmony

They quite forget their loss of liberty

But Warwick after God thou sett'st me free

And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee

He was the author thou the instrument

Therefore that I may conquer Fortune's spite

By living low where Fortune cannot hurt me

And that the people of this blessd land

May not be punished with my thwarting stars

Warwick although my head still wear the crown

I here resign my government to thee

For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds

Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands

Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts

That no dissension hinder government

I make you both Protectors of this land

While I myself will lead a private life

And in devotion spend my latter days

To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise

But with the first of all your chief affairs

Let me entreatfor I command no more

That Margaret your queen and my son Edward

Be sent for to return from France with speed

For till I see them here by doubtful fear

My joy of liberty is half eclipsed

My lord of Somerset what youth is that

Of whom you seem to have so tender care

Come hither England's hope  If secret powers

Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts

This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss

His looks are full of peaceful majesty

His head by nature framed to wear a crown

His hand to wield a scepter and himself

Likely in time to bless a regal throne

Make much of him my lords for this is he

Must help you more than you are hurt by me

Let's levy men and beat him back again

Farewell my Hector and my Troy's true hope

Well-minded Clarence be thou fortunate

Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague

And all at once once more a happy farewell

Here at the palace will I rest awhile

Cousin of Exeter what thinks your Lordship

Methinks the power that Edward hath in field

Should not be able to encounter mine

That's not my fear My meed hath got me fame

I have not stopped mine ears to their demands

Nor posted off their suits with slow delays

My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds

My mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs

My mercy dried their water-flowing tears

I have not been desirous of their wealth

Nor much oppressed them with great subsidies

Nor forward of revenge though they much erred

Then why should they love Edward more than me

No Exeter these graces challenge grace

And when the lion fawns upon the lamb

The lamb will never cease to follow him

Ay my good lordmy lord I should say rather

'Tis sin to flatter good was little better

Good Gloucester and good devil were alike

And both preposterous therefore not good lord

So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf

So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece

And next his throat unto the butcher's knife

What scene of death hath Roscius now to act

The bird that hath been limd in a bush

With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush

And I the hapless male to one sweet bird

Have now the fatal object in my eye

Where my poor young was limed was caught and killed

I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus

Thy father Minos that denied our course

The sun that seared the wings of my sweet boy

Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea

Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life

Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words

My breast can better brook thy dagger's point

Than can my ears that tragic history

But wherefore dost thou come Is 't for my life

A persecutor I am sure thou art

If murdering innocents be executing

Why then thou art an executioner

Hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume

Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine

And thus I prophesy that many a thousand

Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear

And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's

And many an orphan's water-standing eye

Men for their sons wives for their husbands

Orphans for their parents' timeless death

Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born

The owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign

The night-crow cried aboding luckless time

Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees

The raven rooked her on the chimney's top

And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung

Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain

And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope

To wit an indigested and deformd lump

Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree

Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born

To signify thou cam'st to bite the world

And if the rest be true which I have heard

Thou cam'st

Ay and for much more slaughter after this

O God forgive my sins and pardon thee
