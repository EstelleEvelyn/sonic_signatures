


Kind keepers of my weak decaying age

Let dying Mortimer here rest himself

Even like a man new-hald from the rack

So fare my limbs with long imprisonment

And these gray locks the pursuivants of death

Nestor-like agd in an age of care

Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer

These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent

Wax dim as drawing to their exigent

Weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief

And pithless arms like to a withered vine

That droops his sapless branches to the ground

Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb

Unable to support this lump of clay

Swift-wingd with desire to get a grave

As witting I no other comfort have

But tell me keeper will my nephew come

Enough My soul shall then be satisfied

Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine

Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign

Before whose glory I was great in arms

This loathsome sequestration have I had

And even since then hath Richard been obscured

Deprived of honor and inheritance

But now the arbitrator of despairs

Just Death kind umpire of men's miseries

With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence

I would his troubles likewise were expired

That so he might recover what was lost

Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come

Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck

And in his bosom spend my latter gasp

O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks

That I may kindly give one fainting kiss

And now declare sweet stem from York's great stock

Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised

That cause fair nephew that imprisoned me

And hath detained me all my flow'ring youth

Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine

Was cursd instrument of his decease

I will if that my fading breath permit

And death approach not ere my tale be done

Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king

Deposed his nephew Richard Edward's son

The first begotten and the lawful heir

Of Edward king the third of that descent

During whose reign the Percies of the north

Finding his usurpation most unjust

Endeavored my advancement to the throne

The reason moved these warlike lords to this

Was for thatyoung Richard thus removed

Leaving no heir begotten of his body

I was the next by birth and parentage

For by my mother I derivd am

From Lionel Duke of Clarence third son

To King Edward the Third whereas he

From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree

Being but fourth of that heroic line

But mark as in this haughty great attempt

They labord to plant the rightful heir

I lost my liberty and they their lives

Long after this when Henry the Fifth

Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign

Thy father Earl of Cambridge then derived

From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York

Marrying my sister that thy mother was

Again in pity of my hard distress

Levied an army weening to redeem

And have installed me in the diadem

But as the rest so fell that noble earl

And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers

In whom the title rested were suppressed

True and thou seest that I no issue have

And that my fainting words do warrant death

Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather

But yet be wary in thy studious care

With silence nephew be thou politic

Strong-fixd is the house of Lancaster

And like a mountain not to be removed

But now thy uncle is removing hence

As princes do their courts when they are cloyed

With long continuance in a settled place

Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth

Which giveth many wounds when one will kill

Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good

Only give order for my funeral

And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes

And prosperous be thy life in peace and war
