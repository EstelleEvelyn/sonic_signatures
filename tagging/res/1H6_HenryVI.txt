The special watchmen of our English weal,

I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,

To join your hearts in love and amity.

O, what a scandal is it to our crown

That two such noble peers as you should jar!

Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell

Civil dissension is a viperous worm

That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.

What tumult ’s this?

We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,

To hold your slaught’ring hands and keep the peace.—

Pray, Uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.

O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!

Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold

My sighs and tears, and will not once relent?

Who should be pitiful if you be not?

Or who should study to prefer a peace

If holy churchmen take delight in broils?

Fie, Uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach

That malice was a great and grievous sin;

And will not you maintain the thing you teach,

But prove a chief offender in the same?

O, loving uncle—kind Duke of Gloucester—

How joyful am I made by this contract.

Away, my masters, trouble us no more,

But join in friendship as your lords have done.

And those occasions, uncle, were of force.—

Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is

That Richard be restorèd to his blood.

If Richard will be true, not that alone

But all the whole inheritance I give

That doth belong unto the house of York,

From whence you spring by lineal descent.

Stoop then, and set your knee against my foot;

And in reguerdon of that duty done

I girt thee with the valiant sword of York.

Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,

And rise created princely Duke of York.

When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes,

For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.

Is this the Lord Talbot, Uncle Gloucester,

That hath so long been resident in France?

Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord.

When I was young—as yet I am not old—

I do remember how my father said

A stouter champion never handled sword.

Long since we were resolvèd of your truth,

Your faithful service, and your toil in war;

Yet never have you tasted our reward

Or been reguerdoned with so much as thanks,

Because till now we never saw your face.

Therefore stand up; and for these good deserts

We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;

And in our coronation take your place.

Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear’st thy doom.

Be packing therefore, thou that wast a knight.

Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.

And now, my lord protector, view the letter

Sent from our uncle, Duke of Burgundy.

What? Doth my Uncle Burgundy revolt?

Is that the worst this letter doth contain?

Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him

And give him chastisement for this abuse.—

How say you, my lord, are you not content?

Then gather strength and march unto him straight;

Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason

And what offense it is to flout his friends.

Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.—

Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim,

And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?

What is that wrong whereof you both complain?

First let me know, and then I’ll answer you.

Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men

When for so slight and frivolous a cause

Such factious emulations shall arise!

Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,

Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.

Come hither, you that would be combatants:

Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favor,

Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.—

And you, my lords, remember where we are:

In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation.

If they perceive dissension in our looks,

And that within ourselves we disagree,

How will their grudging stomachs be provoked

To willful disobedience and rebel!

Besides, what infamy will there arise

When foreign princes shall be certified

That for a toy, a thing of no regard,

King Henry’s peers and chief nobility

Destroyed themselves and lost the realm of France!

O, think upon the conquest of my father,

My tender years, and let us not forgo

That for a trifle that was bought with blood.

Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.

I see no reason if I wear this rose

That anyone should therefore be suspicious

I more incline to Somerset than York.

Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.

As well they may upbraid me with my crown

Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crowned.

But your discretions better can persuade

Than I am able to instruct or teach;

And therefore, as we hither came in peace,

So let us still continue peace and love.

Cousin of York, we institute your Grace

To be our regent in these parts of France;—

And good my Lord of Somerset, unite

Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;

And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,

Go cheerfully together and digest

Your angry choler on your enemies.

Ourself, my lord protector, and the rest,

After some respite, will return to Callice;

From thence to England, where I hope ere long

To be presented, by your victories,

With Charles, Alanson, and that traitorous rout.

Have you perused the letters from the Pope,

The Emperor, and the Earl of Armagnac?

How doth your Grace affect their motion?

Ay, marry, uncle, for I always thought

It was both impious and unnatural

That such immanity and bloody strife

Should reign among professors of one faith.

Marriage, uncle? Alas, my years are young;

And fitter is my study and my books

Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.

Yet call th’ Ambassadors and, as you please,

So let them have their answers every one.

I shall be well content with any choice

Tends to God’s glory and my country’s weal.

My Lords Ambassadors, your several suits

Have been considered and debated on;

Your purpose is both good and reasonable,

And therefore are we certainly resolved

To draw conditions of a friendly peace,

Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean

Shall be transported presently to France.

In argument and proof of which contract,

Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.—

And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded

And safely brought to Dover, where, inshipped,

Commit them to the fortune of the sea.

Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,

Of beauteous Margaret hath astonished me.

Her virtues gracèd with external gifts

Do breed love’s settled passions in my heart,

And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts

Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,

So am I driven by breath of her renown

Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive

Where I may have fruition of her love.

And otherwise will Henry ne’er presume.—

Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent

That Margaret may be England’s royal queen.

Whether it be through force of your report,

My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that

My tender youth was never yet attaint

With any passion of inflaming love,

I cannot tell; but this I am assured:

I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,

Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,

As I am sick with working of my thoughts.

Take therefore shipping; post, my lord, to France;

Agree to any covenants, and procure

That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come

To cross the seas to England and be crowned

King Henry’s faithful and anointed queen.

For your expenses and sufficient charge,

Among the people gather up a tenth.

Be gone, I say, for till you do return,

I rest perplexèd with a thousand cares.—

And you, good uncle, banish all offense.

If you do censure me by what you were,

Not what you are, I know it will excuse

This sudden execution of my will.

And so conduct me where, from company,

I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
