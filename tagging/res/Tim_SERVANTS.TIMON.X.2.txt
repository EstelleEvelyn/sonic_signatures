My lord

They have all been touched and found base metal

For they have all denied him

Excellent Your Lordship's a goodly villain

The devil knew not what he did when he made

man politic He crossed himself by 't and I cannot

think but in the end the villainies of man will set

him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear

foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those

that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms

on fire

Of such a nature is his politic love

This was my lord's best hope Now all are fled

Save only the gods Now his friends are dead

Doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards

Many a bounteous year must be employed

Now to guard sure their master

And this is all a liberal course allows

Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house
