
Here sir What is your pleasure

I go sir

Good even Varro What you come for money

It is And yours too Isidore

Would we were all discharged

Here comes the lord

My lord here is a note of certain dues

Of Athens here my lord

Please it your Lordship he hath put me off

To the succession of new days this month

My master is awaked by great occasion

To call upon his own and humbly prays you

That with your other noble parts you'll suit

In giving him his right

Nay good my lord

If you did know my lord my master's wants

Stay stay here comes the Fool with Apemantus

Let's ha' some sport with 'em

Where's the fool now

What are we Apemantus

Gramercies good Fool How does your

Ay Would they served us

Ay fool

Aside aside Here comes Lord Timon
