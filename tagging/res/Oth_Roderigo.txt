


Tush never tell me I take it much unkindly

That thou Iago who hast had my purse

As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this

Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate

By heaven I rather would have been his hangman

I would not follow him then

What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe

If he can carry 't thus

Here is her father's house I'll call aloud

What ho Brabantio Signior Brabantio ho

Signior is all your family within

Most reverend signior do you know my voice

My name is Roderigo

Sir sir sir

Patience good sir

Most grave Brabantio

In simple and pure soul I come to you

Sir I will answer anything But I beseech you

If 't be your pleasure and most wise consent

As partly I find it isthat your fair daughter

At this odd-even and dull watch o' th' night

Transported with no worse nor better guard

But with a knave of common hire a gondolier

To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor

If this be known to you and your allowance

We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs

But if you know not this my manners tell me

We have your wrong rebuke Do not believe

That from the sense of all civility

I thus would play and trifle with your Reverence

Your daughter if you have not given her leave

I say again hath made a gross revolt

Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes

In an extravagant and wheeling stranger

Of here and everywhere Straight satisfy yourself

If she be in her chamber or your house

Let loose on me the justice of the state

For thus deluding you

Truly I think they are

Yes sir I have indeed

I think I can discover him if you please

To get good guard and go along with me

Signior it is the Moor

Iago

What will I do think'st thou

I will incontinently drown myself

It is silliness to live when to live is torment

and then have we a prescription to die when death is

our physician

What should I do I confess it is my shame

to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it

It cannot be

Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on

the issue

Where shall we meet i' th' morning

I'll be with thee betimes

What say you

I am changed

I'll sell all my land

With him Why 'tis not possible

I cannot believe that in her She's full of

most blessed condition

Yes that I did But that was but courtesy

Well

I will do this if you can bring it to any

opportunity

Adieu

Beat me

I do follow here in the chase not like a

hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My

money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly

well cudgeled and I think the issue will be I

shall have so much experience for my pains and so

with no money at all and a little more wit return

again to Venice

I do not find

That thou deal'st justly with me

Every day thou daff'st me with some device

Iago and rather as it seems to me now

keep'st from me all conveniency than suppliest me

with the least advantage of hope I will indeed no

longer endure it Nor am I yet persuaded to put up

in peace what already I have foolishly suffered

Faith I have heard too much and your

words and performances are no kin together

With naught but truth I have wasted myself

out of my means The jewels you have had

from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have

corrupted a votaress You have told me she hath

received them and returned me expectations and

comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but I

find none

Very well Go to I cannot go to man

nor 'tis not very well By this hand I say 'tis very

scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in it

I tell you 'tis not very well I will make

myself known to Desdemona If she will return me

my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my

unlawful solicitation If not assure yourself I will

seek satisfaction of you

Ay and said nothing but what I protest

intendment of doing

It hath not appeared

Well what is it Is it within reason and

compass

Is that true Why then Othello and Desdemona

return again to Venice

How do you mean removing him

And that you would have me to do

I will hear further reason for this

Be near at hand I may miscarry in 't

I have no great devotion to the deed

And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons

'Tis but a man gone Forth my sword He dies

I know his gait 'Tis heVillain thou diest

O I am slain

O villain that I am

O wretched villain

Nobody come Then shall I bleed to death

O help me here

O damned Iago O inhuman dog
