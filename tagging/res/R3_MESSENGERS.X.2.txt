


My lord my lord

One from the Lord Stanley

Upon the stroke of four

So it appears by that I have to say

First he commends him to your noble self

Then certifies your Lordship that this night

He dreamt the boar had razd off his helm

Besides he says there are two councils kept

And that may be determined at the one

Which may make you and him to rue at th' other

Therefore he sends to know your Lordship's pleasure

If you will presently take horse with him

And with all speed post with him toward the north

To shun the danger that his soul divines

I'll go my lord and tell him what you say
