


The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner

Called the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles

For him was I exchanged and ransomd

But with a baser man-of-arms by far

Once in contempt they would have bartered me

Which I disdaining scorned and cravd death

Rather than I would be so vile-esteemed

In fine redeemed I was as I desired

But O the treacherous Fastolf wounds my heart

Whom with my bare fists I would execute

If I now had him brought into my power

With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts

In open marketplace produced they me

To be a public spectacle to all

Here said they is the terror of the French

The scarecrow that affrights our children so

Then broke I from the officers that led me

And with my nails digged stones out of the ground

To hurl at the beholders of my shame

My grisly countenance made others fly

None durst come near for fear of sudden death

In iron walls they deemed me not secure

So great fear of my name 'mongst them were spread

That they supposed I could rend bars of steel

And spurn in pieces posts of adamant

Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had

That walked about me every minute-while

And if I did but stir out of my bed

Ready they were to shoot me to the heart

For aught I see this city must be famished

Or with light skirmishes enfeebld

What chance is this that suddenly hath crossed us

Speak Salisburyat least if thou canst speak

How far'st thou mirror of all martial men

One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off

Accursd tower accursd fatal hand

That hath contrived this woeful tragedy

In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame

Henry the Fifth he first trained to the wars

Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up

His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field

Yet liv'st thou Salisbury Though thy speech doth fail

One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace

The sun with one eye vieweth all the world

Heaven be thou gracious to none alive

If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands

Sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life

Speak unto Talbot Nay look up to him

Bear hence his body I will help to bury it

Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort

Thou shalt not die whiles

He beckons with his hand and smiles on me

As who should say When I am dead and gone

Remember to avenge me on the French

Plantagenet I will and like thee Nero

Play on the lute beholding the towns burn

Wretched shall France be only in my name

What stir is this What tumult's in the heavens

Whence cometh this alarum and the noise

Hear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan

It irks his heart he cannot be revenged

Frenchmen I'll be a Salisbury to you

Pucelle or puzel dauphin or dogfish

Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels

And make a quagmire of your mingled brains

Convey we Salisbury into his tent

And then try what these dastard Frenchmen dare

Where is my strength my valor and my force

Our English troops retire I cannot stay them

A woman clad in armor chaseth them

Here here she comesI'll have a bout with thee

Devil or devil's dam I'll conjure thee

Blood will I draw on theethou art a witch

And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st

Heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail

My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage

And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder

But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet

My thoughts are whirld like a potter's wheel

I know not where I am nor what I do

A witch by fearnot force like Hannibal

Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists

So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench

Are from their hives and houses driven away

They called us for our fierceness English dogs

Now like to whelps we crying run away

Hark countrymen either renew the fight

Or tear the lions out of England's coat

Renounce your soil give sheep in lions' stead

Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf

Or horse or oxen from the leopard

As you fly from your oft-subdud slaves

It will not be Retire into your trenches

You all consented unto Salisbury's death

For none would strike a stroke in his revenge

Pucelle is entered into Orleance

In spite of us or aught that we could do

O would I were to die with Salisbury

The shame hereof will make me hide my head

Lord Regent and redoubted Burgundy

By whose approach the regions of Artois

Walloon and Picardy are friends to us

This happy night the Frenchmen are secure

Having all day caroused and banqueted

Embrace we then this opportunity

As fitting best to quittance their deceit

Contrived by art and baleful sorcery

A maid they say

Well let them practice and converse with spirits

God is our fortress in whose conquering name

Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks

Not all together Better far I guess

That we do make our entrance several ways

That if it chance the one of us do fail

The other yet may rise against their force

And here will Talbot mount or make his grave

Now Salisbury for thee and for the right

Of English Henry shall this night appear

How much in duty I am bound to both

Bring forth the body of old Salisbury

And here advance it in the marketplace

The middle center of this cursd town

Now have I paid my vow unto his soul

For every drop of blood was drawn from him

There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight

And that hereafter ages may behold

What ruin happened in revenge of him

Within their chiefest temple I'll erect

A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred

Upon the which that everyone may read

Shall be engraved the sack of Orleance

The treacherous manner of his mournful death

And what a terror he had been to France

But lords in all our bloody massacre

I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace

His new-come champion virtuous Joan of Arc

Nor any of his false confederates

Here is the Talbot Who would speak with him

Ne'er trust me then for when a world of men

Could not prevail with all their oratory

Yet hath a woman's kindness overruled

And therefore tell her I return great thanks

And in submission will attend on her

Will not your Honors bear me company

Well then alone since there's no remedy

I mean to prove this lady's courtesy

Come hither captain You perceive my mind

Madam I have been bold to trouble you

But since your Ladyship is not at leisure

I'll sort some other time to visit you

Marry for that she's in a wrong belief

I go to certify her Talbot's here

Prisoner To whom

Ha ha ha

I laugh to see your Ladyship so fond

To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow

Whereon to practice your severity

I am indeed

No no I am but shadow of myself

You are deceived my substance is not here

For what you see is but the smallest part

And least proportion of humanity

I tell you madam were the whole frame here

It is of such a spacious lofty pitch

Your roof were not sufficient to contain 't

That will I show you presently

How say you madam Are you now persuaded

That Talbot is but shadow of himself

These are his substance sinews arms and strength

With which he yoketh your rebellious necks

Razeth your cities and subverts your towns

And in a moment makes them desolate

Be not dismayed fair lady nor misconster

The mind of Talbot as you did mistake

The outward composition of his body

What you have done hath not offended me

Nor other satisfaction do I crave

But only with your patience that we may

Taste of your wine and see what cates you have

For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well

France thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears

If Talbot but survive thy treachery

Pucelle that witch that damnd sorceress

Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares

That hardly we escaped the pride of France

Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite

Encompassed with thy lustful paramours

Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age

And twit with cowardice a man half dead

Damsel I'll have a bout with you again

Or else let Talbot perish with this shame

Dare you come forth and meet us in the field

I speak not to that railing Hecate

But unto thee Alanson and the rest

Will you like soldiers come and fight it out

Seigneur hang Base muleteers of France

Like peasant footboys do they keep the walls

And dare not take up arms like gentlemen

And there will we be too ere it be long

Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame

Vow Burgundy by honor of thy house

Pricked on by public wrongs sustained in France

Either to get the town again or die

And I as sure as English Henry lives

And as his father here was conqueror

As sure as in this late-betrayd town

Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was burid

So sure I swear to get the town or die

But ere we go regard this dying prince

The valiant Duke of BedfordCome my lord

We will bestow you in some better place

Fitter for sickness and for crazy age

Undaunted spirit in a dying breast

Then be it so Heavens keep old Bedford safe

And now no more ado brave Burgundy

But gather we our forces out of hand

And set upon our boasting enemy

Lost and recovered in a day again

This is a double honor Burgundy

Yet heavens have glory for this victory

Thanks gentle duke But where is Pucelle now

I think her old familiar is asleep

Now where's the Bastard's braves and Charles his gleeks

What all amort Roan hangs her head for grief

That such a valiant company are fled

Now will we take some order in the town

Placing therein some expert officers

And then depart to Paris to the King

For there young Henry with his nobles lie

But yet before we go let's not forget

The noble Duke of Bedford late-deceased

But see his exequies fulfilled in Roan

A braver soldier never couchd lance

A gentler heart did never sway in court

But kings and mightiest potentates must die

For that's the end of human misery

My gracious prince and honorable peers

Hearing of your arrival in this realm

I have awhile given truce unto my wars

To do my duty to my sovereign

In sign whereof this arm that hath reclaimed

To your obedience fifty fortresses

Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength

Besides five hundred prisoners of esteem

Lets fall his sword before your Highness' feet

And with submissive loyalty of heart

Ascribes the glory of his conquest got

First to my God and next unto your Grace

Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee

I vowed base knight when I did meet thee next

To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg

Which I have done because unworthily

Thou wast installd in that high degree

Pardon me princely Henry and the rest

This dastard at the battle of Patay

When but in all I was six thousand strong

And that the French were almost ten to one

Before we met or that a stroke was given

Like to a trusty squire did run away

In which assault we lost twelve hundred men

Myself and divers gentlemen besides

Were there surprised and taken prisoners

Then judge great lords if I have done amiss

Or whether that such cowards ought to wear

This ornament of knighthoodyea or no

When first this Order was ordained my lords

Knights of the Garter were of noble birth

Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage

Such as were grown to credit by the wars

Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress

But always resolute in most extremes

He then that is not furnished in this sort

Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight

Profaning this most honorable Order

And should if I were worthy to be judge

Be quite degraded like a hedge-born swain

That doth presume to boast of gentle blood

Content my liege Yes But that I am prevented

I should have begged I might have been employed

I go my lord in heart desiring still

You may behold confusion of your foes

Go to the gates of Bordeaux trumpeter

Summon their general unto the wall

English John Talbot captains calls you forth

Servant-in-arms to Harry King of England

And thus he would open your city gates

Be humble to us call my sovereign yours

And do him homage as obedient subjects

And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power

But if you frown upon this proffered peace

You tempt the fury of my three attendants

Lean Famine quartering Steel and climbing Fire

Who in a moment even with the earth

Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers

If you forsake the offer of their love

He fables not I hear the enemy

Out some light horsemen and peruse their wings

O negligent and heedless discipline

How are we parked and bounded in a pale

A little herd of England's timorous deer

Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs

If we be English deer be then in blood

Not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch

But rather moody-mad and desperate stags

Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel

And make the cowards stand aloof at bay

Sell every man his life as dear as mine

And they shall find dear deer of us my friends

God and Saint George Talbot and England's right

Prosper our colors in this dangerous fight

O young John Talbot I did send for thee

To tutor thee in stratagems of war

That Talbot's name might be in thee revived

When sapless age and weak unable limbs

Should bring thy father to his drooping chair

ButO malignant and ill-boding stars

Now thou art come unto a feast of Death

A terrible and unavoided danger

Therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse

And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape

By sudden flight Come dally not be gone

Fly to revenge my death if I be slain

If we both stay we both are sure to die

Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb

Upon my blessing I command thee go

Part of thy father may be saved in thee

Thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it

Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain

And leave my followers here to fight and die

My age was never tainted with such shame

Then here I take my leave of thee fair son

Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon

Come side by side together live and die

And soul with soul from France to heaven fly

Saint George and victory Fight soldiers fight

The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word

And left us to the rage of France his sword

Where is John TalbotPause and take thy breath

I gave thee life and rescued thee from death

When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire

It warmed thy father's heart with proud desire

Of bold-faced victory Then leaden age

Quickened with youthful spleen and warlike rage

Beat down Alanson Orleance Burgundy

And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee

The ireful Bastard Orleance that drew blood

From thee my boy and had the maidenhood

Of thy first fight I soon encounterd

And interchanging blows I quickly shed

Some of his bastard blood and in disgrace

Bespoke him thus Contaminated base

And misbegotten blood I spill of thine

Mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine

Which thou didst force from Talbot my brave boy

Here purposing the Bastard to destroy

Came in strong rescue Speak thy father's care

Art thou not weary John How dost thou fare

Wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly

Now thou art sealed the son of chivalry

Fly to revenge my death when I am dead

The help of one stands me in little stead

O too much folly is it well I wot

To hazard all our lives in one small boat

If I today die not with Frenchmen's rage

Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age

By me they nothing gain and if I stay

'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day

In thee thy mother dies our household's name

My death's revenge thy youth and England's fame

All these and more we hazard by thy stay

All these are saved if thou wilt fly away

Then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of Crete

Thou Icarus thy life to me is sweet

If thou wilt fight fight by thy father's side

And commendable proved let's die in pride

Where is my other life Mine own is gone

O where's young Talbot Where is valiant John

Triumphant Death smeared with captivity

Young Talbot's valor makes me smile at thee

When he perceived me shrink and on my knee

His bloody sword he brandished over me

And like a hungry lion did commence

Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience

But when my angry guardant stood alone

Tend'ring my ruin and assailed of none

Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart

Suddenly made him from my side to start

Into the clust'ring battle of the French

And in that sea of blood my boy did drench

His over-mounting spirit and there died

My Icarus my blossom in his pride

Thou antic Death which laugh'st us here to scorn

Anon from thy insulting tyranny

Coupled in bonds of perpetuity

Two Talbots wingd through the lither sky

In thy despite shall scape mortality

O thou whose wounds become hard-favored Death

Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath

Brave Death by speaking whither he will or no

Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe

Poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say

Had Death been French then Death had died today

Come come and lay him in his father's arms

My spirit can no longer bear these harms

Soldiers adieu I have what I would have

Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave
