What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.

Had you such leisure in the time of death

To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?

Awaked you not in this sore agony?

No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.

I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.

I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
