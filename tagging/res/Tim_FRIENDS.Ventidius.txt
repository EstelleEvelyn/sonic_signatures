


Most honored Timon,

It hath pleased the gods to remember my father’s age

And call him to long peace.

He is gone happy and has left me rich.

Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound

To your free heart, I do return those talents,

Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help

I derived liberty.

A noble spirit!

So are we all.
