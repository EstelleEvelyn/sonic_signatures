


May 't please your Majesty to give us leave

Freely to render what we have in charge

Or shall we sparingly show you far off

The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy

Thus then in few

Your Highness lately sending into France

Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right

Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third

In answer of which claim the Prince our master

Says that you savor too much of your youth

And bids you be advised there's naught in France

That can be with a nimble galliard won

You cannot revel into dukedoms there

He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit

This tun of treasure and in lieu of this

Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim

Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks
