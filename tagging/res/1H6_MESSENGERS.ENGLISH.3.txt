


My gracious lords to add to your laments

Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse

I must inform you of a dismal fight

Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French

O no wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown

The circumstance I'll tell you more at large

The tenth of August last this dreadful lord

Retiring from the siege of Orleance

Having full scarce six thousand in his troop

By three and twenty thousand of the French

Was round encompassd and set upon

No leisure had he to enrank his men

He wanted pikes to set before his archers

Instead whereof sharp stakes plucked out of hedges

They pitchd in the ground confusedly

To keep the horsemen off from breaking in

More than three hours the fight continud

Where valiant Talbot above human thought

Enacted wonders with his sword and lance

Hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him

Here there and everywhere enraged he slew

The French exclaimed the devil was in arms

All the whole army stood agazed on him

His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit

 Talbot  Talbot cried out amain

And rushed into the bowels of the battle

Here had the conquest fully been sealed up

If Sir John Fastolf had not played the coward

He being in the vaward placed behind

With purpose to relieve and follow them

Cowardly fled not having struck one stroke

Hence grew the general wrack and massacre

Enclosd were they with their enemies

A base Walloon to win the Dauphin's grace

Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back

Whom all France with their chief assembled strength

Durst not presume to look once in the face

O no he lives but is took prisoner

And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford

Most of the rest slaughtered or took likewise

So you had need 'fore Orleance besieged

The English army is grown weak and faint

The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply

And hardly keeps his men from mutiny

Since they so few watch such a multitude
