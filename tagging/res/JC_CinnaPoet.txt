


I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,

And things unluckily charge my fantasy.

I have no will to wander forth of doors,

Yet something leads me forth.

What is my name? Whither am I going? Where

do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor?

Then to answer every man directly and briefly,

wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.

Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.

As a friend.

Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

Truly, my name is Cinna.

I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet!

I am not Cinna the conspirator.
