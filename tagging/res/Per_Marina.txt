


No I will rob Tellus of her weed

To strew thy green with flowers The yellows blues

The purple violets and marigolds

Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave

While summer days doth last Ay me poor maid

Born in a tempest when my mother died

This world to me is as a lasting storm

Whirring me from my friends

No

I pray you I'll not bereave you of your servant

Well I will go

But yet I have no desire to it

My thanks sweet madam

Is this wind westerly that blows

When I was born the wind was north

My father as nurse says did never fear

But cried Good seamen to the sailors

Galling his kingly hands haling ropes

And clasping to the mast endured a sea

That almost burst the deck

When I was born

Never was waves nor wind more violent

And from the ladder-tackle washes off

A canvas-climber Ha says one Wolt out

And with a dropping industry they skip

From stern to stern The Boatswain whistles and

The Master calls and trebles their confusion

What mean you

Why will you kill me

Why would she have me killed

Now as I can remember by my troth

I never did her hurt in all my life

I never spake bad word nor did ill turn

To any living creature Believe me la

I never killed a mouse nor hurt a fly

I trod upon a worm against my will

But I wept for 't How have I offended

Wherein my death might yield her any profit

Or my life imply her any danger

You will not do 't for all the world I hope

You are well-favored and your looks foreshow

You have a gentle heart I saw you lately

When you caught hurt in parting two that fought

Good sooth it showed well in you Do so now

Your lady seeks my life Come you between

And save poor me the weaker

Alack that Leonine was so slack so slow

He should have struck not spoke Or that these pirates

Not enough barbarous had but o'erboard thrown me

For to seek my mother

That I am pretty

I accuse them not

The more my fault to 'scape his hands where

I was to die

No

Are you a woman

An honest woman or not a woman

The gods defend me

I understand you not

If fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep

Untied I still my virgin knot will keep

Diana aid my purpose

I desire to find him so that I may worthily

note him

If he govern the country you are bound to him

indeed but how honorable he is in that I know

not

What he will do graciously I will thankfully

receive

What trade sir

I cannot be offended with my trade Please

you to name it

E'er since I can remember

Earlier too sir if now I be one

Do you know this house to be a place of such

resort and will come into 't I hear say you're of

honorable parts and are the governor of this place

Who is my principal

If you were born to honor show it now

If put upon you make the judgment good

That thought you worthy of it

For me

That am a maid though most ungentle Fortune

Have placed me in this sty where since I came

Diseases have been sold dearer than physic

That the gods

Would set me free from this unhallowed place

Though they did change me to the meanest bird

That flies i' the purer air

The good gods preserve you

Whither would you have me

Hark hark you gods

Whither wilt thou have me

Prithee tell me one thing first

What canst thou wish thine enemy to be

Neither of these are so bad as thou art

Since they do better thee in their command

Thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend

Of hell would not in reputation change

Thou art the damnd doorkeeper to every

Coistrel that comes enquiring for his Tib

To the choleric fisting of every rogue

Thy ear is liable Thy food is such

As hath been belched on by infected lungs

Do anything but this thou dost Empty

Old receptacles or common shores of filth

Serve by indenture to the common hangman

Any of these ways are yet better than this

For what thou professest a baboon could he speak

Would own a name too dear That the gods

Would safely deliver me from this place

Here here's gold for thee

If that thy master would gain by me

Proclaim that I can sing weave sew and dance

With other virtues which I'll keep from boast

And will undertake all these to teach

I doubt not but this populous city

Will yield many scholars

Prove that I cannot take me home again

And prostitute me to the basest groom

That doth frequent your house

But amongst honest women

Sir I will use

My utmost skill in his recovery provided

That none but I and my companion maid

Be suffered to come near him

No nor looked on us

Hail sir My lord lend ear

I am a maid my lord

That ne'er before invited eyes but have

Been gazed on like a comet She speaks

My lord that may be hath endured a grief

Might equal yours if both were justly weighed

Though wayward Fortune did malign my state

My derivation was from ancestors

Who stood equivalent with mighty kings

But time hath rooted out my parentage

And to the world and awkward casualties

Bound me in servitude I will desist

But there is something glows upon my cheek

And whispers in mine ear Go not till he speak

I said my lord if you did know my parentage

You would not do me violence

No nor of any shores

Yet I was mortally brought forth and am

No other than I appear

Where I am but a stranger

From the deck you may discern the place

If I should tell my history it would seem

Like lies disdained in the reporting

So indeed I did

Some such thing I said

And said no more but what my thoughts

Did warrant me was likely

My name is Marina

Patience good sir

Or here I'll cease

The name

Was given me by one that had some power

My father and a king

You said you would believe me

But not to be a troubler of your peace

I will end here

Called Marina

For I was born at sea

My mother was the daughter of a king

Who died the minute I was born

As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft

Delivered weeping

You scorn Believe me 'twere best I did give o'er

The King my father did in Tarsus leave me

Till cruel Cleon with his wicked wife

Did seek to murder me and having wooed a villain

To attempt it who having drawn to do 't

A crew of pirates came and rescued me

Brought me to MytileneBut good sir

Whither will you have me Why do you weep

It may be you think me an impostor

No good faith

I am the daughter to King Pericles

If good King Pericles be

First sir I pray what is your title

Is it no more to be your daughter than

To say my mother's name was Thaisa

Thaisa was my mother who did end

The minute I began

My heart

Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom
