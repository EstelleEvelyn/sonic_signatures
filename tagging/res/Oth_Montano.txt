


What from the cape can you discern at sea

Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land

A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements

If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea

What ribs of oak when mountains melt on them

Can hold the mortise What shall we hear of this

If that the Turkish fleet

Be not ensheltered and embayed they are drowned

It is impossible to bear it out

How Is this true

I am glad on 't 'Tis a worthy governor

Pray heaven he be

For I have served him and the man commands

Like a full soldier Let's to the seaside ho

As well to see the vessel that's come in

As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello

Even till we make the main and th' aerial blue

An indistinct regard

Is he well shipped

But good lieutenant is your general wived

What is she

Good faith a little one not past a pint as I

am a soldier

I am for it lieutenant and I'll do you

justice

To th' platform masters Come let's set the watch

But is he often thus

It were well

The General were put in mind of it

Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature

Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio

And looks not on his evils Is not this true

And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor

Should hazard such a place as his own second

With one of an engraffed infirmity

It were an honest action to say so

To the Moor

What's the matter lieutenant

Nay good lieutenant I pray you sir hold

your hand

Come come you're drunk

Zounds I bleed still

I am hurt to th' death He dies

Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger

Your officer Iago can inform you

While I spare speech which something now offends me

Of all that I do know nor know I aught

By me that's said or done amiss this night

Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice

And to defend ourselves it be a sin

When violence assails us

If partially affined or leagued in office

Thou dost deliver more or less than truth

Thou art no soldier

What is the matter How now general

O heavens forfend

O monstrous act

'Tis a notorious villain Take you this weapon

Which I have here recovered from the Moor

Come guard the door without Let him not pass

But kill him rather I'll after that same villain

For 'tis a damnd slave
