


I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard

And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die

And so should these if I might have my will

And so am I My name is Walter Whitmore

How now why starts thou What doth death affright

Gualtier or Walter which it is I care not

Never yet did base dishonor blur our name

But with our sword we wiped away the blot

Therefore when merchantlike I sell revenge

Broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced

And I proclaimed a coward through the world

The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags

Speak captain shall I stab the forlorn swain

Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death

Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee

What are you daunted now Now will you stoop

There let his head and lifeless body lie

Until the Queen his mistress bury it
