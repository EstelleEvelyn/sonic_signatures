
I do not doubt

But that my noble master will appear

Such as he is full of regard and honor

Fly further off my lord fly further off

Mark Antony is in your tents my lord

Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off

O my lord

Titinius is enclosd round about

With horsemen that make to him on the spur

Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him

Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too

He's ta'en And hark they shout for joy

So I am free yet would not so have been

Durst I have done my willO Cassius

Far from this country Pindarus shall run

Where never Roman shall take note of him
