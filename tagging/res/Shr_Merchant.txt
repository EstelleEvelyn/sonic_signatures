


God save you sir

Sir at the farthest for a week or two

But then up farther and as far as Rome

And so to Tripoli if God lend me life

Of Mantua

My life sir How I pray For that goes hard

Alas sir it is worse for me than so

For I have bills for money by exchange

From Florence and must here deliver them

Ay sir in Pisa have I often been

Pisa renownd for grave citizens

I know him not but I have heard of him

A merchant of incomparable wealth

O sir I do and will repute you ever

The patron of my life and liberty

Ay what else And but I be deceived

Signior Baptista may remember me

Near twenty years ago in Genoa

Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus

I warrant you    But sir here comes your boy

'Twere good he were schooled

Soft son

Sir by your leave having come to Padua

To gather in some debts my son Lucentio

Made me acquainted with a weighty cause

Of love between your daughter and himself

And for the good report I hear of you

And for the love he beareth to your daughter

And she to him to stay him not too long

I am content in a good father's care

To have him matched And if you please to like

No worse than I upon some agreement

Me shall you find ready and willing

With one consent to have her so bestowed

For curious I cannot be with you

Signior Baptista of whom I hear so well

What's he that knocks as

he would beat down the gate

He's within sir but not to

be spoken withal

Keep your hundred

pounds to yourself He shall need none so long as I

live

Thou liest His father is

come from Padua and here looking out at the

window

Ay sir so his mother says

if I may believe her

Lay hands on the villain I

believe he means to cosen somebody in this city

under my countenance

Help son Help Signior

Baptista

Away away mad ass His

name is Lucentio and he is mine only son and heir

to the lands of me Signior Vincentio

Swear if thou dar'st
