


I had thought sir to have held my peace until

You had drawn oaths from him not to stay You sir

Charge him too coldly Tell him you are sure

All in Bohemia's well This satisfaction

The bygone day proclaimed Say this to him

He's beat from his best ward

To tell he longs to see his son were strong

But let him say so then and let him go

But let him swear so and he shall not stay

We'll thwack him hence with distaffs

Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure

The borrow of a week When at Bohemia

You take my lord I'll give him my commission

To let him there a month behind the gest

Prefixed for 's partingYet good deed Leontes

I love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind

What lady she her lordYou'll stay

Nay but you will

Verily

You put me off with limber vows But I

Though you would seek t' unsphere the stars with oaths

Should yet say Sir no going Verily

You shall not go A lady's verily is

As potent as a lord's Will you go yet

Force me to keep you as a prisoner

Not like a guest so you shall pay your fees

When you depart and save your thanks How say you

My prisoner or my guest By your dread verily

One of them you shall be

Not your jailer then

But your kind hostess Come I'll question you

Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys

You were pretty lordings then

Was not my lord

The verier wag o' th' two

By this we gather

You have tripped since

Grace to boot

Of this make no conclusion lest you say

Your queen and I are devils Yet go on

Th' offenses we have made you do we'll answer

If you first sinned with us and that with us

You did continue fault and that you slipped not

With any but with us

He'll stay my lord

Never

What have I twice said well When was 't before

I prithee tell me Cram 's with praise and make 's

As fat as tame things One good deed dying tongueless

Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that

Our praises are our wages You may ride 's

With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere

With spur we heat an acre But to th' goal

My last good deed was to entreat his stay

What was my first It has an elder sister

Or I mistake you O would her name were Grace

But once before I spoke to th' purpose When

Nay let me have 't I long

'Tis grace indeed

Why lo you now I have spoke to th' purpose twice

The one forever earned a royal husband

Th' other for some while a friend

He something seems unsettled

You look

As if you held a brow of much distraction

Are you moved my lord

If you would seek us

We are yours i' th' garden Shall 's attend you there

Take the boy to you He so troubles me

'Tis past enduring

What wisdom stirs amongst youCome sir now

I am for you again Pray you sit by us

And tell 's a tale

As merry as you will

Let's have that good sir

Come on sit down Come on and do your best

To fright me with your sprites You're powerful at it

Nay come sit down then on

Come on then and give 't me in mine ear

What is this Sport

But I'd say he had not

And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying

Howe'er you lean to th' nayward

Should a villain say so

The most replenished villain in the world

He were as much more villain You my lord

Do but mistake

No by my life

Privy to none of this How will this grieve you

When you shall come to clearer knowledge that

You thus have published me Gentle my lord

You scarce can right me throughly then to say

You did mistake

There's some ill planet reigns

I must be patient till the heavens look

With an aspect more favorable Good my lords

I am not prone to weeping as our sex

Commonly are the want of which vain dew

Perchance shall dry your pities But I have

That honorable grief lodged here which burns

Worse than tears drown Beseech you all my lords

With thoughts so qualified as your charities

Shall best instruct you measure me and so

The King's will be performed

Who is 't that goes with me Beseech your Highness

My women may be with me for you see

My plight requires itDo not weep good fools

There is no cause When you shall know your mistress

Has deserved prison then abound in tears

As I come out This action I now go on

Is for my better graceAdieu my lord

I never wished to see you sorry now

I trust I shallMy women come you have leave

Since what I am to say must be but that

Which contradicts my accusation and

The testimony on my part no other

But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me

To say Not guilty Mine integrity

Being counted falsehood shall as I express it

Be so received But thus if powers divine

Behold our human actions as they do

I doubt not then but innocence shall make

False accusation blush and tyranny

Tremble at patience You my lord best know

Whom least will seem to do so my past life

Hath been as continent as chaste as true

As I am now unhappy which is more

Than history can pattern though devised

And played to take spectators For behold me

A fellow of the royal bed which owe

A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter

The mother to a hopeful prince here standing

To prate and talk for life and honor fore

Who please to come and hear For life I prize it

As I weigh grief which I would spare For honor

'Tis a derivative from me to mine

And only that I stand for I appeal

To your own conscience sir before Polixenes

Came to your court how I was in your grace

How merited to be so since he came

With what encounter so uncurrent I

Have strained t' appear thus if one jot beyond

The bound of honor or in act or will

That way inclining hardened be the hearts

Of all that hear me and my near'st of kin

Cry fie upon my grave

That's true enough

Though 'tis a saying sir not due to me

More than mistress of

Which comes to me in name of fault I must not

At all acknowledge For Polixenes

With whom I am accused I do confess

I loved him as in honor he required

With such a kind of love as might become

A lady like me with a love even such

So and no other as yourself commanded

Which not to have done I think had been in me

Both disobedience and ingratitude

To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke

Even since it could speak from an infant freely

That it was yours Now for conspiracy

I know not how it tastes though it be dished

For me to try how All I know of it

Is that Camillo was an honest man

And why he left your court the gods themselves

Wotting no more than I are ignorant

Sir

You speak a language that I understand not

My life stands in the level of your dreams

Which I'll lay down

Sir spare your threats

The bug which you would fright me with I seek

To me can life be no commodity

The crown and comfort of my life your favor

I do give lost for I do feel it gone

But know not how it went My second joy

And first fruits of my body from his presence

I am barred like one infectious My third comfort

Starred most unluckily is from my breast

The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth

Haled out to murder myself on every post

Proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred

The childbed privilege denied which longs

To women of all fashion lastly hurried

Here to this place i' th' open air before

I have got strength of limit Now my liege

Tell me what blessings I have here alive

That I should fear to die Therefore proceed

But yet hear this mistake me not no life

I prize it not a straw but for mine honor

Which I would free if I shall be condemned

Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else

But what your jealousies awake I tell you

'Tis rigor and not law Your Honors all

I do refer me to the oracle

Apollo be my judge

The Emperor of Russia was my father

O that he were alive and here beholding

His daughter's trial that he did but see

The flatness of my misery yet with eyes

Of pity not revenge

Praised

You gods look down

And from your sacred vials pour your graces

Upon my daughter's head Tell me mine own

Where hast thou been preserved Where lived How found

Thy father's court For thou shalt hear that I

Knowing by Paulina that the oracle

Gave hope thou wast in being have preserved

Myself to see the issue
