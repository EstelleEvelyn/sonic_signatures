


Call here my varlet I'll unarm again

Why should I war without the walls of Troy

That find such cruel battle here within

Each Trojan that is master of his heart

Let him to field Troilus alas hath none

The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength

Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant

But I am weaker than a woman's tear

Tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance

Less valiant than the virgin in the night

And skilless as unpracticed infancy

Have I not tarried

Have I not tarried

Still have I tarried

Patience herself what goddess e'er she be

Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do

At Priam's royal table do I sit

And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts

So traitor When she comes When is she thence

I was about to tell thee when my heart

As wedgd with a sigh would rive in twain

Lest Hector or my father should perceive me

I have as when the sun doth light a-scorn

Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile

But sorrow that is couched in seeming gladness

Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness

O Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus

When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drowned

Reply not in how many fathoms deep

They lie indrenched I tell thee I am mad

In Cressid's love Thou answer'st she is fair

Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart

Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice

Handiest in thy discourseOthat her hand

In whose comparison all whites are ink

Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure

The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense

Hard as the palm of plowman This thou tell'st me

As true thou tell'st me when I say I love her

But saying thus instead of oil and balm

Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me

The knife that made it

Thou dost not speak so much

Good Pandarushow now Pandarus

What art thou angry Pandarus What with

me

Say I she is not fair

Pandarus

Sweet Pandarus

Peace you ungracious clamors Peace rude sounds

Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair

When with your blood you daily paint her thus

I cannot fight upon this argument

It is too starved a subject for my sword

But PandarusO gods how do you plague me

I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar

And he's as tetchy to be wooed to woo

As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit

Tell me Apollo for thy Daphnes love

What Cressid is what Pandar and what we

Her bed is India there she lies a pearl

Between our Ilium and where she resides

Let it be called the wild and wand'ring flood

Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar

Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark

Because not there This woman's answer sorts

For womanish it is to be from thence

What news Aeneas from the field today

By whom Aeneas

Let Paris bleed 'Tis but a scar to scorn

Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn

Better at home if would I might were may

But to the sport abroad Are you bound thither

Come go we then together

Fie fie my brother

Weigh you the worth and honor of a king

So great as our dread father's in a scale

Of common ounces Will you with counters sum

The past-proportion of his infinite

And buckle in a waist most fathomless

With spans and inches so diminutive

As fears and reasons Fie for godly shame

You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest

You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons

You know an enemy intends you harm

You know a sword employed is perilous

And reason flies the object of all harm

Who marvels then when Helenus beholds

A Grecian and his sword if he do set

The very wings of reason to his heels

And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove

Or like a star disorbed Nay if we talk of reason

Let's shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honor

Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts

With this crammed reason Reason and respect

Make livers pale and lustihood deject

What's aught but as 'tis valued

I take today a wife and my election

Is led on in the conduct of my will

My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears

Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores

Of will and judgment How may I avoid

Although my will distaste what it elected

The wife I choose There can be no evasion

To blench from this and to stand firm by honor

We turn not back the silks upon the merchant

When we have soiled them nor the remainder viands

We do not throw in unrespective sieve

Because we now are full It was thought meet

Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks

Your breath with full consent bellied his sails

The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce

And did him service He touched the ports desired

And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive

He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness

Wrinkles Apollo's and makes pale the morning

Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt

Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl

Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships

And turned crowned kings to merchants

If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went

As you must needs for you all cried Go go

If you'll confess he brought home worthy prize

As you must needs for you all clapped your hands

And cried Inestimablewhy do you now

The issue of your proper wisdoms rate

And do a deed that never Fortune did

Beggar the estimation which you prized

Richer than sea and land O theft most base

That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep

But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n

That in their country did them that disgrace

We fear to warrant in our native place

'Tis our mad sister I do know her voice

Why brother Hector

We may not think the justness of each act

Such and no other than event doth form it

Nor once deject the courage of our minds

Because Cassandra's mad Her brainsick raptures

Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel

Which hath our several honors all engaged

To make it gracious For my private part

I am no more touched than all Priam's sons

And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us

Such things as might offend the weakest spleen

To fight for and maintain

Why there you touched the life of our design

Were it not glory that we more affected

Than the performance of our heaving spleens

I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood

Spent more in her defense But worthy Hector

She is a theme of honor and renown

A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds

Whose present courage may beat down our foes

And fame in time to come canonize us

For I presume brave Hector would not lose

So rich advantage of a promised glory

As smiles upon the forehead of this action

For the wide world's revenue

Sirrah walk off

No Pandarus I stalk about her door

Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks

Staying for waftage O be thou my Charon

And give me swift transportance to those fields

Where I may wallow in the lily beds

Proposed for the deserver O gentle Pandar

From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings

And fly with me to Cressid

I am giddy expectation whirls me round

Th' imaginary relish is so sweet

That it enchants my sense What will it be

When that the wat'ry palate taste indeed

Love's thrice-repurd nectar Death I fear me

Swooning destruction or some joy too fine

Too subtle-potent tuned too sharp in sweetness

For the capacity of my ruder powers

I fear it much and I do fear besides

That I shall lose distinction in my joys

As doth a battle when they charge on heaps

The enemy flying

Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom

My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse

And all my powers do their bestowing lose

Like vassalage at unawares encount'ring

The eye of majesty

You have bereft me of all words lady

O Cressid how often have I wished me thus

What should they grant What makes this

pretty abruption What too-curious dreg espies

my sweet lady in the fountain of our love

Fears make devils of cherubins they never

see truly

O let my lady apprehend no fear In all

Cupid's pageant there is presented no monster

Nothing but our undertakings when we vow

to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers

thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition

enough than for us to undergo any difficulty

imposed This is the monstruosity in love lady that

the will is infinite and the execution confined that

the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit

Are there such Such are not we Praise us as

we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall

go bare till merit crown it No perfection in reversion

shall have a praise in present We will not

name desert before his birth and being born his

addition shall be humble Few words to fair faith

Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can

say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what

truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus

You know now your hostages

your uncle's word and my firm faith

Why was my Cressid then so hard to win

And shall albeit sweet music issues thence

Your leave sweet Cressid

What offends you lady

You cannot shun yourself

Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely

O that I thought it could be in a woman

As if it can I will presume in you

To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love

To keep her constancy in plight and youth

Outliving beauty's outward with a mind

That doth renew swifter than blood decays

Or that persuasion could but thus convince me

That my integrity and truth to you

Might be affronted with the match and weight

Of such a winnowed purity in love

How were I then uplifted But alas

I am as true as truth's simplicity

And simpler than the infancy of truth

O virtuous fight

When right with right wars who shall be most right

True swains in love shall in the world to come

Approve their truth by Troilus When their rhymes

Full of protest of oath and big compare

Wants similes truth tired with iteration

As true as steel as plantage to the moon

As sun to day as turtle to her mate

As iron to adamant as Earth to th' center

Yet after all comparisons of truth

As truth's authentic author to be cited

As true as Troilus shall crown up the verse

And sanctify the numbers

Amen

Dear trouble not yourself The morn is cold

Trouble him not

To bed to bed Sleep kill those pretty eyes

And give as soft attachment to thy senses

As infants' empty of all thought

I prithee now to bed

O Cressida But that the busy day

Waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows

And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer

I would not from thee

Beshrew the witch With venomous wights she stays

As tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love

With wings more momentary-swift than thought

You will catch cold and curse me

It is your uncle

Ha ha

How now What's the matter

Is it so concluded

How my achievements mock me

I will go meet them And my Lord Aeneas

We met by chance you did not find me here

Walk into her house

I'll bring her to the Grecian presently

And to his hand when I deliver her

Think it an altar and thy brother Troilus

A priest there off'ring to it his own heart

Cressid I love thee in so strained a purity

That the blest gods as angry with my fancy

More bright in zeal than the devotion which

Cold lips blow to their deitiestake thee from me

A hateful truth

From Troy and Troilus

And suddenly where injury of chance

Puts back leave-taking jostles roughly by

All time of pause rudely beguiles our lips

Of all rejoindure forcibly prevents

Our locked embrasures strangles our dear vows

Even in the birth of our own laboring breath

We two that with so many thousand sighs

Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves

With the rude brevity and discharge of one

Injurious Time now with a robber's haste

Crams his rich thiev'ry up he knows not how

As many farewells as be stars in heaven

With distinct breath and consigned kisses to them

He fumbles up into a loose adieu

And scants us with a single famished kiss

Distasted with the salt of broken tears

Hark you are called Some say the genius

Cries so to him that instantly must die

Bid them have patience She shall come anon

No remedy

Hear me my love Be thou but true of heart

Nay we must use expostulation kindly

For it is parting from us

I speak not Be thou true as fearing thee

For I will throw my glove to Death himself

That there is no maculation in thy heart

But Be thou true say I to fashion in

My sequent protestation Be thou true

And I will see thee

And I'll grow friend with danger Wear this sleeve

I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels

To give thee nightly visitation

But yet be true

Hear why I speak it love

The Grecian youths are full of quality

Their loving well composed with gift of nature flowing

And swelling o'er with arts and exercise

How novelty may move and parts with person

Alas a kind of godly jealousy

Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin

Makes me afeard

Die I a villain then

In this I do not call your faith in question

So mainly as my merit I cannot sing

Nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk

Nor play at subtle gamesfair virtues all

To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant

But I can tell that in each grace of these

There lurks a still and dumb-discursive devil

That tempts most cunningly But be not tempted

No

But something may be done that we will not

And sometimes we are devils to ourselves

When we will tempt the frailty of our powers

Presuming on their changeful potency

Come kiss and let us part

Good brother come you hither

And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you

Who I Alas it is my vice my fault

Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion

I with great truth catch mere simplicity

Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns

With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare

Fear not my truth The moral of my wit

Is plain and true there's all the reach of it

Welcome Sir Diomed Here is the lady

Which for Antenor we deliver you

At the port lord I'll give her to thy hand

And by the way possess thee what she is

Entreat her fair and by my soul fair Greek

If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword

Name Cressid and thy life shall be as safe

As Priam is in Ilium

Grecian thou dost not use me courteously

To shame the zeal of my petition to thee

In praising her I tell thee lord of Greece

She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises

As thou unworthy to be called her servant

I charge thee use her well even for my charge

For by the dreadful Pluto if thou dost not

Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard

I'll cut thy throat

Come to the port I'll tell thee Diomed

This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head

Lady give me your hand and as we walk

To our own selves bend we our needful talk

Hector thou sleep'st Awake thee

My Lord Ulysses tell me I beseech you

In what place of the field doth Calchas keep

Shall I sweet lord be bound to you so much

After we part from Agamemnon's tent

To bring me thither

O sir to such as boasting show their scars

A mock is due Will you walk on my lord

She was beloved she loved she is and doth

But still sweet love is food for Fortune's tooth

Sweet sir you honor me

Cressid comes forth to him

Yea so familiar

What should she remember

Hold patience

Thy better must

O plague and madness

Behold I pray you

I prithee stay

I pray you stay By hell and all hell's torments

I will not speak a word

Doth that grieve thee O withered truth

By Jove I will be patient

She strokes his cheek

Nay stay By Jove I will not speak a word

There is between my will and all offenses

A guard of patience Stay a little while

Fear me not my lord

I will not be myself nor have cognition

Of what I feel I am all patience

O beauty where is thy faith

I will be patient outwardly I will

I did swear patience

Wert thou the devil and wor'st it on thy horn

It should be challenged

Nor I by Pluto But that that likes not you

Pleases me best

It is

To make a recordation to my soul

Of every syllable that here was spoke

But if I tell how these two did co-act

Shall I not lie in publishing a truth

Sith yet there is a credence in my heart

An esperance so obstinately strong

That doth invert th' attest of eyes and ears

As if those organs had deceptious functions

Created only to calumniate

Was Cressid here

She was not sure

Why my negation hath no taste of madness

Let it not be believed for womanhood

Think we had mothers Do not give advantage

To stubborn critics apt without a theme

For depravation to square the general sex

By Cressid's rule Rather think this not Cressid

Nothing at all unless that this were she

This she No this is Diomed's Cressida

If beauty have a soul this is not she

If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies

If sanctimony be the gods' delight

If there be rule in unity itself

This is not she O madness of discourse

That cause sets up with and against itself

Bifold authority where reason can revolt

Without perdition and loss assume all reason

Without revolt This is and is not Cressid

Within my soul there doth conduce a fight

Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate

Divides more wider than the sky and Earth

And yet the spacious breadth of this division

Admits no orifex for a point as subtle

As Ariachne's broken woof to enter

Instance O instance strong as Pluto's gates

Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven

Instance O instance strong as heaven itself

The bonds of heaven are slipped dissolved and loosed

And with another knot five-finger-tied

The fractions of her faith orts of her love

The fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics

Of her o'er-eaten faith are given to Diomed

Ay Greek and that shall be divulgd well

In characters as red as Mars his heart

Inflamed with Venus Never did young man fancy

With so eternal and so fixed a soul

Hark Greek as much as I do Cressid love

So much by weight hate I her Diomed

That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm

Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill

My sword should bite it Not the dreadful spout

Which shipmen do the hurricano call

Constringed in mass by the almighty sun

Shall dizzy with more clamor Neptune's ear

In his descent than shall my prompted sword

Falling on Diomed

O Cressid O false Cressid False false false

Let all untruths stand by thy staind name

And they'll seem glorious

Have with you princeMy courteous lord adieu

Farewell revolted fairAnd Diomed

Stand fast and wear a castle on thy head

Accept distracted thanks

Brother you have a vice of mercy in you

Which better fits a lion than a man

When many times the captive Grecian falls

Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword

You bid them rise and live

Fool's play by heaven Hector

For th' love of all the gods

Let's leave the hermit Pity with our mother

And when we have our armors buckled on

The venomed Vengeance ride upon our swords

Spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth

Hector then 'tis wars

Who should withhold me

Not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars

Beck'ning with fiery truncheon my retire

Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees

Their eyes o'er-galld with recourse of tears

Nor you my brother with your true sword drawn

Opposed to hinder me should stop my way

But by my ruin

This foolish dreaming superstitious girl

Makes all these bodements

Away away

They are at it hark Proud Diomed believe

I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve

What now

Let me read

Words words mere words no matter from the heart

Th' effect doth operate another way

Go wind to wind There turn and change together

My love with words and errors still she feeds

But edifies another with her deeds

Fly not for shouldst thou take the river Styx

I would swim after

O traitor Diomed Turn thy false face thou traitor

And pay the life thou owest me for my horse

Come both you cogging Greeks Have at you both

Ajax hath ta'en Aeneas Shall it be

No by the flame of yonder glorious heaven

He shall not carry him I'll be ta'en too

Or bring him off Fate hear me what I say

I reck not though I end my life today

Hector is slain

He's dead and at the murderer's horse's tail

In beastly sort dragged through the shameful field

Frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed

Sit gods upon your thrones and smite at Troy

I say at once let your brief plagues be mercy

And linger not our sure destructions on

You understand me not that tell me so

I do not speak of flight of fear of death

But dare all imminence that gods and men

Address their dangers in Hector is gone

Who shall tell Priam so or Hecuba

Let him that will a screech-owl aye be called

Go into Troy and say their Hector's dead

There is a word will Priam turn to stone

Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives

Cold statues of the youth and in a word

Scare Troy out of itself But march away

Hector is dead There is no more to say

Stay yet You vile abominable tents

Thus proudly pitched upon our Phrygian plains

Let Titan rise as early as he dare

I'll through and through you And thou great-sized coward

No space of earth shall sunder our two hates

I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still

That moldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts

Strike a free march to Troy With comfort go

Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe

Hence broker lackey Ignomy and shame

Pursue thy life and live aye with thy name
