


God shall forgive you Coeur de Lion’s death

The rather that you give his offspring life,

Shadowing their right under your wings of war.

I give you welcome with a powerless hand

But with a heart full of unstainèd love.

Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.

Good my mother, peace.

I would that I were low laid in my grave.

I am not worth this coil that’s made for me.

I do beseech you, madam, be content.

O, this will make my mother die with grief!

Good morrow, Hubert.

As little prince, having so great a title

To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.

Mercy on me!

Methinks nobody should be sad but I.

Yet I remember, when I was in France,

Young gentlemen would be as sad as night

Only for wantonness. By my christendom,

So I were out of prison and kept sheep,

I should be as merry as the day is long.

And so I would be here but that I doubt

My uncle practices more harm to me.

He is afraid of me, and I of him.

Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son?

No, indeed, is ’t not. And I would to heaven

I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.

Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale today.

In sooth, I would you were a little sick

That I might sit all night and watch with you.

I warrant I love you more than you do me.

Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.

Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?

And will you?

Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,

I knit my handkercher about your brows—

The best I had, a princess wrought it me—

And I did never ask it you again;

And with my hand at midnight held your head,

And like the watchful minutes to the hour

Still and anon cheered up the heavy time,

Saying “What lack you?” and “Where lies your grief?”

Or “What good love may I perform for you?”

Many a poor man’s son would have lien still

And ne’er have spoke a loving word to you;

But you at your sick service had a prince.

Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,

And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.

If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,

Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes—

These eyes that never did nor never shall

So much as frown on you?

Ah, none but in this Iron Age would do it.

The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,

Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears

And quench this fiery indignation

Even in the matter of mine innocence;

Nay, after that, consume away in rust

But for containing fire to harm mine eye.

Are you more stubborn-hard than hammered iron?

An if an angel should have come to me

And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,

I would not have believed him. No tongue but Hubert’s.

O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out

Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.

Alas, what need you be so boist’rous-rough?

I will not struggle; I will stand stone-still.

For God’s sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!

Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,

And I will sit as quiet as a lamb.

I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word

Nor look upon the iron angerly.

Thrust but these men away, and I’ll forgive you,

Whatever torment you do put me to.

Alas, I then have chid away my friend!

He hath a stern look but a gentle heart.

Let him come back, that his compassion may

Give life to yours.

Is there no remedy?

O God, that there were but a mote in yours,

A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,

Any annoyance in that precious sense.

Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,

Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.

Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues

Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.

Let me not hold my tongue. Let me not, Hubert,

Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,

So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,

Though to no use but still to look on you.

Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold,

And would not harm me.

No, in good sooth. The fire is dead with grief,

Being create for comfort, to be used

In undeserved extremes. See else yourself.

There is no malice in this burning coal.

The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out

And strewed repentant ashes on his head.

An if you do, you will but make it blush

And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.

Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,

And, like a dog that is compelled to fight,

Snatch at his master that doth tar him on.

All things that you should use to do me wrong

Deny their office. Only you do lack

That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,

Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.

O, now you look like Hubert. All this while

You were disguisèd.

O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.

The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.

Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not.

There’s few or none do know me. If they did,

This shipboy’s semblance hath disguised me quite.

I am afraid, and yet I’ll venture it.

If I get down and do not break my limbs,

I’ll find a thousand shifts to get away.

As good to die and go as die and stay.

O me, my uncle’s spirit is in these stones.

Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones.
