Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,

Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

Of thirty sail; and now they do restem

Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance

Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,

Your trusty and most valiant servitor,

With his free duty recommends you thus,

And prays you to believe him.
