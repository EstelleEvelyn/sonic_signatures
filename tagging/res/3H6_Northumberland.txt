


If I be not heavens be revenged on me

Well hast thou spoken cousin Be it so

Yes Warwick I remember it to my grief

And by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it

Plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st

Think not that Henry shall be so deposed

Thou art deceived 'Tis not thy southern power

Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent

Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud

Can set the Duke up in despite of me

Nor I

Be thou a prey unto the house of York

And die in bands for this unmanly deed

Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet

Hold Clifford do not honor him so much

To prick thy finger though to wound his heart

What valor were it when a cur doth grin

For one to thrust his hand between his teeth

When he might spurn him with his foot away

It is war's prize to take all vantages

And ten to one is no impeach of valor

So doth the coney struggle in the net

What would your Grace have done unto him now

Beshrew me but his passions moves me so

That hardly can I check my eyes from tears

Had he been slaughterman to all my kin

I should not for my life but weep with him

To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul

Be it with resolution then to fight

No nor your manhood that durst make you stay
