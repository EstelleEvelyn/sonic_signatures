


God's arm strike with us 'Tis a fearful odds

God be wi' you princes all I'll to my charge

If we no more meet till we meet in heaven

Then joyfully my noble Lord of Bedford

My dear Lord Gloucester and my good Lord Exeter

And my kind kinsman warriors all adieu

My sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed

The French are bravely in their battles set

And will with all expedience charge on us
