


Then never trust me if I be afeard

He that is giddy thinks the world turns round

Thus I conceive by him

Your husband being troubled with a shrew

Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe

And now you know my meaning

Right I mean you

Lord let me never have a cause to sigh

Till I be brought to such a silly pass

Come come you're mocking We will have no telling

She shall not
