At Berwick in the North, an ’t like your Grace.

God knows, of pure devotion, being called

A hundred times and oftener in my sleep

By good Saint Alban, who said “Simon, come,

Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.”

Ay, God Almighty help me!

A fall off of a tree.

O, born so, master.

But that in all my life, when I was a youth.

Alas, good master, my wife desired some

damsons, and made me climb, with danger of my

life.

Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and

Saint Alban.

Red, master, red as blood.

Black, forsooth, coal-black as jet.

Alas, master, I know not.

I know not.

No, indeed, master.

Sander Simpcox, an if it please you, master.

O master, that you could!

Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone.

You go about to torture me in vain.

Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to

stand.
