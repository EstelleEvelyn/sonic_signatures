


By your patience no My stars shine darkly

over me The malignancy of my fate might perhaps

distemper yours Therefore I shall crave of you your

leave that I may bear my evils alone It were a bad

recompense for your love to lay any of them on you

No sooth sir My determinate voyage is

mere extravagancy But I perceive in you so excellent

a touch of modesty that you will not extort

from me what I am willing to keep in Therefore it

charges me in manners the rather to express myself

You must know of me then Antonio my name

is Sebastian which I called Roderigo My father was

that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have

heard of He left behind him myself and a sister

both born in an hour If the heavens had been

pleased would we had so ended But you sir

altered that for some hour before you took me

from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned

A lady sir though it was said she much

resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful

But though I could not with such estimable

wonder overfar believe that yet thus far I will boldly

publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but

call fair She is drowned already sir with salt water

though I seem to drown her remembrance again

with more

O good Antonio forgive me your trouble

If you will not undo what you have done

that is kill him whom you have recovereddesire

it not Fare you well at once My bosom is full of

kindness and I am yet so near the manners of my

mother that upon the least occasion more mine

eyes will tell tales of me I am bound to the Count

Orsino's court Farewell

I would not by my will have troubled you

But since you make your pleasure of your pains

I will no further chide you

My kind Antonio

I can no other answer make but thanks

And thanks and ever thanks and oft good turns

Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay

But were my worth as is my conscience firm

You should find better dealing What's to do

Shall we go see the relics of this town

I am not weary and 'tis long to night

I pray you let us satisfy our eyes

With the memorials and the things of fame

That do renown this city

Belike you slew great number of his people

Do not then walk too open

Why I your purse

I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you

For an hour

I do remember

Go to go to thou art a foolish fellow Let

me be clear of thee

I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else

Thou know'st not me

I prithee foolish Greek depart from me

There's money for thee If you

tarry longer I shall give worse payment

Why there's for thee

and there and thereAre all the people mad

Let go thy hand

I will be free from thee  What wouldst thou now

If thou dar'st tempt me further draw thy sword

What relish is in this How runs the stream

Or I am mad or else this is a dream

Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep

If it be thus to dream still let me sleep

Madam I will

This is the air that is the glorious sun

This pearl she gave me I do feel 't and see 't

And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus

Yet 'tis not madness Where's Antonio then

I could not find him at the Elephant

Yet there he was and there I found this credit

That he did range the town to seek me out

His counsel now might do me golden service

For though my soul disputes well with my sense

That this may be some error but no madness

Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune

So far exceed all instance all discourse

That I am ready to distrust mine eyes

And wrangle with my reason that persuades me

To any other trust but that I am mad

Or else the lady's mad Yet if 'twere so

She could not sway her house command her followers

Take and give back affairs and their dispatch

With such a smooth discreet and stable bearing

As I perceive she does There's something in 't

That is deceivable But here the lady comes

I'll follow this good man and go with you

And having sworn truth ever will be true

I am sorry madam I have hurt your kinsman

But had it been the brother of my blood

I must have done no less with wit and safety

You throw a strange regard upon me and by that

I do perceive it hath offended you

Pardon me sweet one even for the vows

We made each other but so late ago

Antonio O my dear Antonio

How have the hours racked and tortured me

Since I have lost thee

Fear'st thou that Antonio

Do I stand there I never had a brother

Nor can there be that deity in my nature

Of here and everywhere I had a sister

Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured

Of charity what kin are you to me

What countryman What name What parentage

A spirit I am indeed

But am in that dimension grossly clad

Which from the womb I did participate

Were you a woman as the rest goes even

I should my tears let fall upon your cheek

And say Thrice welcome drownd Viola

And so had mine

O that record is lively in my soul

He finishd indeed his mortal act

That day that made my sister thirteen years

So comes it lady you have been mistook

But nature to her bias drew in that

You would have been contracted to a maid

Nor are you therein by my life deceived

You are betrothed both to a maid and man
