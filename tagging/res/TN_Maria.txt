


By my troth Sir Toby you must come in earlier

o' nights Your cousin my lady takes great exceptions

to your ill hours

Ay but you must confine yourself within the

modest limits of order

That quaffing and drinking will undo you I

heard my lady talk of it yesterday and of a foolish

knight that you brought in one night here to be her

wooer

Ay he

What's that to th' purpose

Ay but he'll have but a year in all these ducats

He's a very fool and a prodigal

He hath indeed almost natural for besides

that he's a fool he's a great quarreler and but that

he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath

in quarreling 'tis thought among the prudent he

would quickly have the gift of a grave

They that add moreover he's drunk nightly in

your company

And you too sir

My name is Mary sir

Fare you well gentlemen

Sir I have not you by th' hand

Now sir thought is free I

pray you bring your hand to th' butt'ry bar and let

it drink

It's dry sir

A dry jest sir

Ay sir I have them at my fingers' ends Marry

now I let go your hand I am barren

Nay either tell me where thou hast been or I

will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter

in way of thy excuse My lady will hang thee for thy

absence

Make that good

A good Lenten answer I can tell thee where

that saying was born of I fear no colors

In the wars and that may you be bold to say in

your foolery

Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent

Or to be turned away is not that as good as a

hanging to you

You are resolute then

That if one break the other will hold or if both

break your gaskins fall

Peace you rogue No more o' that Here comes

my lady Make your excuse wisely you were best

Madam there is at the gate a young gentleman

much desires to speak with you

I know not madam 'Tis a fair young man and

well attended

Sir Toby madam your kinsman

Will you hoist sail sir Here lies your way

What a caterwauling do you keep here If my

lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and

bid him turn you out of doors never trust me

For the love o' God peace

Nay good Sir Toby

Go shake your ears

Sweet Sir Toby be patient for tonight Since the

youth of the Count's was today with my lady she is

much out of quiet For Monsieur Malvolio let me

alone with him If I do not gull him into a nayword

and make him a common recreation do not think I

have wit enough to lie straight in my bed I know I

can do it

Marry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritan

The devil a puritan that he is or anything

constantly but a time-pleaser an affectioned ass

that cons state without book and utters it by great

swaths the best persuaded of himself so crammed

as he thinks with excellencies that it is his grounds

of faith that all that look on him love him And on

that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause

to work

I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of

love wherein by the color of his beard the shape of

his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his

eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself

most feelingly personated I can write very like my

lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can

hardly make distinction of our hands

My purpose is indeed a horse of that color

Ass I doubt not

Sport royal I warrant you I know my physic

will work with him I will plant you two and let the

Fool make a third where he shall find the letter

Observe his construction of it For this night to bed

and dream on the event Farewell

Get you all three into the boxtree Malvolio's

coming down this walk He has been yonder i' the

sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half

hour Observe him for the love of mockery for I

know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of

him Close in the name of jesting Lie

thou there for here comes

the trout that must be caught with tickling

Nay but say true does it work upon him

If you will then see the fruits of the sport

mark his first approach before my lady He will

come to her in yellow stockings and 'tis a color

she abhors and cross-gartered a fashion she detests

and he will smile upon her which will now

be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted

to a melancholy as she is that it cannot

but turn him into a notable contempt If you will

see it follow me

If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves

into stitches follow me Yond gull Malvolio is

turned heathen a very renegado for there is no

Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly

can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness

He's in yellow stockings

Most villainously like a pedant that keeps a

school i' th' church I have dogged him like his

murderer He does obey every point of the letter

that I dropped to betray him He does smile his face

into more lines than is in the new map with the

augmentation of the Indies You have not seen such

a thing as 'tis I can hardly forbear hurling things at

him I know my lady will strike him If she do he'll

smile and take 't for a great favor

He's coming madam but in very strange manner

He is sure possessed madam

No madam he does nothing but smile Your

Ladyship were best to have some guard about you if

he come for sure the man is tainted in 's wits

How do you Malvolio

Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness

before my lady

Lo how hollow the fiend speaks

within him Did not I tell you Sir Toby my lady

prays you to have a care of him

La you an you speak ill of the devil

how he takes it at heart Pray God he be not

bewitched

Marry and it shall be done tomorrow morning

if I live My lady would not lose him for more than

I'll say

O Lord

Get him to say his prayers good Sir Toby get

him to pray

No I warrant you he will not hear of

godliness

Nay pursue him now lest the device take air

and taint

The house will be the quieter

You may have very fit occasion for 't He is now

in some commerce with my lady and will by and

by depart

Nay I prithee put on this gown and this beard

make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate Do

it quickly I'll call Sir Toby the whilst

Thou mightst have done this without thy beard

and gown He sees thee not
