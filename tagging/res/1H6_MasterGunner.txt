


Sirrah thou know'st how Orleance is besieged

And how the English have the suburbs won

But now thou shalt not Be thou ruled by me

Chief master-gunner am I of this town

Something I must do to procure me grace

The Prince's espials have informd me

How the English in the suburbs close entrenched

Went through a secret grate of iron bars

In yonder tower to overpeer the city

And thence discover how with most advantage

They may vex us with shot or with assault

To intercept this inconvenience

A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed

And even these three days have I watched

If I could see them Now do thou watch

For I can stay no longer

If thou spy'st any run and bring me word

And thou shalt find me at the Governor's
