If the great gods be just they shall assist

The deeds of justest men

Whiles we are suitors to their throne decays

The thing we sue for

I shall do well

The people love me and the sea is mine

My powers are crescent and my auguring hope

Says it will come to th' full Mark Antony

In Egypt sits at dinner and will make

No wars without doors Caesar gets money where

He loses hearts Lepidus flatters both

Of both is flattered but he neither loves

Nor either cares for him

Where have you this 'Tis false

He dreams I know they are in Rome together

Looking for Antony But all the charms of love

Salt Cleopatra soften thy wanned lip

Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both

Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts

Keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks

Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite

That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor

Even till a Lethe'd dullness    How now Varrius

I could have given less matter

A better earMenas I did not think

This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm

For such a petty war His soldiership

Is twice the other twain But let us rear

The higher our opinion that our stirring

Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck

The ne'er lust-wearied Antony

I know not Menas

How lesser enmities may give way to greater

Were 't not that we stand up against them all

'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves

For they have entertaind cause enough

To draw their swords But how the fear of us

May cement their divisions and bind up

The petty difference we yet not know

Be 't as our gods will have 't It only stands

Our lives upon to use our strongest hands

Come Menas

Your hostages I have so have you mine

And we shall talk before we fight

To you all three

The senators alone of this great world

Chief factors for the gods I do not know

Wherefore my father should revengers want

Having a son and friends since Julius Caesar

Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted

There saw you laboring for him What was 't

That moved pale Cassius to conspire And what

Made the all-honored honest Roman Brutus

With the armed rest courtiers of beauteous freedom

To drench the Capitol but that they would

Have one man but a man And that is it

Hath made me rig my navy at whose burden

The angered ocean foams with which I meant

To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome

Cast on my noble father

At land indeed

Thou dost o'ercount me of my father's house

But since the cuckoo builds not for himself

Remain in 't as thou mayst

You have made me offer

Of Sicily Sardinia and I must

Rid all the sea of pirates then to send

Measures of wheat to Rome This 'greed upon

To part with unhacked edges and bear back

Our targes undinted

Know then

I came before you here a man prepared

To take this offer But Mark Antony

Put me to some impatienceThough I lose

The praise of it by telling you must know

When Caesar and your brother were at blows

Your mother came to Sicily and did find

Her welcome friendly

Let me have your hand

I did not think sir to have met you here

Well I know not

What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face

But in my bosom shall she never come

To make my heart her vassal

I hope so Lepidus Thus we are agreed

I crave our composition may be written

And sealed between us

We'll feast each other ere we part and let's

Draw lots who shall begin

No Antony take the lot But first or last

Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have

The fame I have heard that Julius Caesar

Grew fat with feasting there

I have fair meanings sir

Then so much have I heard

And I have heard Apollodorus carried

What I pray you

I know thee now How far'st thou soldier

Let me shake thy hand

I never hated thee I have seen thee fight

When I have envied thy behavior

Enjoy thy plainness

It nothing ill becomes thee

Aboard my galley I invite you all

Will you lead lords

Come

Sit and some wine A health to Lepidus

Say in mine ear what is 't

Forbear me till anonThis wine for Lepidus

Go hang sir hang Tell me of that Away

Do as I bid youWhere's this cup I called for

I think th' art mad  The matter

Thou hast served me with much faith What's else to say

Be jolly lords

What sayst thou

How should that be

Hast thou drunk well

Show me which way

Ah this thou shouldst have done

And not have spoke on 't In me 'tis villainy

In thee 't had been good service Thou must know

'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor

Mine honor it Repent that e'er thy tongue

Hath so betrayed thine act Being done unknown

I should have found it afterwards well done

But must condemn it now Desist and drink

This health to Lepidus

Fill till the cup be hid

This is not yet an Alexandrian feast

Let's ha 't good soldier

Cup us till the world go round

Cup us till the world go round

I'll try you on the shore

O Antony you have my father's house

But what We are friends Come down into the boat
