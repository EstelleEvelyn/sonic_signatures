


Amen

And that is the wavering commons for their love

Lies in their purses and whoso empties them

By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate

If judgment lie in them then so do we

Because we ever have been near the King

No I will to Ireland to his Majesty

Farewell If heart's presages be not vain

We three here part that ne'er shall meet again

I fear me never

Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle

My Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue

Scorns to unsay what once it hath delivered

In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted

I heard you say Is not my arm of length

That reacheth from the restful English court

As far as Calais to mine uncle's head

Amongst much other talk that very time

I heard you say that you had rather refuse

The offer of an hundred thousand crowns

Than Bolingbroke's return to England

Adding withal how blest this land would be

In this your cousin's death
