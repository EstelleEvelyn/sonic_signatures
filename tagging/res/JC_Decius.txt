


Here lies the east doth not the day break here

Shall no man else be touched but only Caesar

Never fear that If he be so resolved

I can o'ersway him for he loves to hear

That unicorns may be betrayed with trees

And bears with glasses elephants with holes

Lions with toils and men with flatterers

But when I tell him he hates flatterers

He says he does being then most flatterd

Let me work

For I can give his humor the true bent

And I will bring him to the Capitol

Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar

I come to fetch you to the Senate House

Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause

Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so

This dream is all amiss interpreted

It was a vision fair and fortunate

Your statue spouting blood in many pipes

In which so many smiling Romans bathed

Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck

Reviving blood and that great men shall press

For tinctures stains relics and cognizance

This by Calphurnia's dream is signified

I have when you have heard what I can say

And know it now the Senate have concluded

To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar

If you shall send them word you will not come

Their minds may change Besides it were a mock

Apt to be rendered for someone to say

Break up the Senate till another time

When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams

If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper

Lo Caesar is afraid

Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love

To your proceeding bids me tell you this

And reason to my love is liable

Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread

At your best leisure this his humble suit

Where is Metellus Cimber Let him go

And presently prefer his suit to Caesar

Great Caesar

And Cassius too

What shall we forth
