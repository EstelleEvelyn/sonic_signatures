


The climate's delicate the air most sweet

Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing

The common praise it bears

But of all the burst

And the ear-deaf'ning voice o' th' oracle

Kin to Jove's thunder so surprised my sense

That I was nothing

Great Apollo

Turn all to th' best These proclamations

So forcing faults upon Hermione

I little like

All this we swear

Sir you have done enough and have performed

A saintlike sorrow No fault could you make

Which you have not redeemedindeed paid down

More penitence than done trespass At the last

Do as the heavens have done forget your evil

With them forgive yourself

Not at all good lady

You might have spoken a thousand things that would

Have done the time more benefit and graced

Your kindness better

You tempt him over-much

Good madam
