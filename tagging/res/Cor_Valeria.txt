


My ladies both good day to you

How do you both You are manifest housekeepers

What are you sewing here A fine spot in

good faith How does your little son

O' my word the father's son I'll swear 'tis a

very pretty boy O' my troth I looked upon him o'

Wednesday half an hour together H'as such a confirmed

countenance I saw him run after a gilded

butterfly and when he caught it he let it go again

and after it again and over and over he comes

and up again catched it again Or whether his fall

enraged him or how 'twas he did so set his teeth

and tear it O I warrant how he mammocked it

Indeed la 'tis a noble child

Come lay aside your stitchery I must have

you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon

Not out of doors

Fie you confine yourself most unreasonably

Come you must go visit the good lady that lies in

You would be another Penelope Yet they say

all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill

Ithaca full of moths Come I would your cambric

were sensible as your finger that you might leave

pricking it for pity Come you shall go with us

In truth la go with me and I'll tell you excellent

news of your husband

Verily I do not jest with you There came

news from him last night

In earnest it's true I heard a senator speak it

Thus it is the Volsces have an army forth against

whom Cominius the General is gone with one

part of our Roman power Your lord and Titus Lartius

are set down before their city Corioles They

nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief

wars This is true on mine honor and so I pray go

with us

In troth I think she wouldFare you well

thenCome good sweet ladyPrithee Virgilia

turn thy solemness out o' door and go along with

us

Well then farewell

Nay 'tis true

In troth there's wondrous things spoke of

him

Welcome to Rome renownd Coriolanus
