
We are sent

To give thee from our royal master thanks

Only to herald thee into his sight

Not pay thee

Who was the Thane lives yet

But under heavy judgment bears that life

Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined

With those of Norway or did line the rebel

With hidden help and vantage or that with both

He labored in his country's wrack I know not

But treasons capital confessed and proved

Have overthrown him

Near Birnam Wood

Shall we well meet them That way are they coming

Now does he feel

His secret murders sticking on his hands

Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach

Those he commands move only in command

Nothing in love Now does he feel his title

Hang loose about him like a giant's robe

Upon a dwarfish thief
