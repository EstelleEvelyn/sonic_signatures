


Threescore and ten I can remember well,

Within the volume of which time I have seen

Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night

Hath trifled former knowings.

’Tis unnatural,

Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last

A falcon, tow’ring in her pride of place,

Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.

’Tis said they eat each other.

God’s benison go with you and with those

That would make good of bad and friends of foes.
