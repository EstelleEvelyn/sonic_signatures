


If the Duke with the other dukes come not to

composition with the King of Hungary why then all

the dukes fall upon the King

Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate

that went to sea with the ten commandments but

scraped one out of the table

Ay that he razed

I believe thee for I think thou never wast where

grace was said

In any proportion or in any language

Ay why not Grace is grace despite of all

controversy as for example thou thyself art a

wicked villain despite of all grace

I grant as there may between the lists and the

velvet Thou art the list

I think thou dost and indeed with most painful

feeling of thy speech I will out of thine own

confession learn to begin thy health but whilst I

live forget to drink after thee

Behold behold where Madam Mitigation

comes I have purchased as many diseases under

her roof as come to

Judge

A French crown more

Nay not as one would say healthy but so sound

as things that are hollow Thy bones are hollow

Impiety has made a feast of thee

But after all this fooling I would not have it so

Art thou sure of this

Believe me this may be He promised to meet

me two hours since and he was ever precise in

promise-keeping

Away Let's go learn the truth of it

Why how now Claudio Whence comes this restraint

If I could speak so wisely under an arrest I

would send for certain of my creditors And yet to

say the truth I had as lief have the foppery of

freedom as the mortality of imprisonment What's

thy offense Claudio

What is 't murder

Lechery

A hundred if they'll do you any good Is lechery

so looked after

With child perhaps

I warrant it is And thy head stands so tickle on

thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may

sigh it off Send after the Duke and appeal to him

I pray she may as well for the encouragement of

the like which else would stand under grievous

imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I

would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a

game of tick-tack I'll to her

Within two hours

Ho peace be in this place

Hail virgin if you be as those cheek-roses

Proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me

As bring me to the sight of Isabella

A novice of this place and the fair sister

To her unhappy brother Claudio

Gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you

Not to be weary with you he's in prison

For that which if myself might be his judge

He should receive his punishment in thanks

He hath got his friend with child

'Tis true

I would not though 'tis my familiar sin

With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest

Tongue far from heart play with all virgins so

I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted

By your renouncement an immortal spirit

And to be talked with in sincerity

As with a saint

Do not believe it Fewness and truth 'tis thus

Your brother and his lover have embraced

As those that feed grow full as blossoming time

That from the seedness the bare fallow brings

To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb

Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry

Is she your cousin

She it is

This is the point

The Duke is very strangely gone from hence

Bore many gentlemen myself being one

In hand and hope of action but we do learn

By those that know the very nerves of state

His givings-out were of an infinite distance

From his true-meant design Upon his place

And with full line of his authority

Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood

Is very snow-broth one who never feels

The wanton stings and motions of the sense

But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge

With profits of the mind study and fast

Heto give fear to use and liberty

Which have for long run by the hideous law

As mice by lionshath picked out an act

Under whose heavy sense your brother's life

Falls into forfeit He arrests him on it

And follows close the rigor of the statute

To make him an example All hope is gone

Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer

To soften Angelo And that's my pith of business

'Twixt you and your poor brother

Has censured him already

And as I hear the Provost hath a warrant

For 's execution

Assay the power you have

Our doubts are traitors

And makes us lose the good we oft might win

By fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo

And let him learn to know when maidens sue

Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel

All their petitions are as freely theirs

As they themselves would owe them

But speedily

I take my leave of you

Give 't not o'er so To him again entreat him

Kneel down before him hang upon his gown

You are too cold If you should need a pin

You could not with more tame a tongue desire it

To him I say

You are too cold

Ay touch him there's the vein

Ay well said

That's well said

O to him to him wench He will relent

He's coming I perceive 't

Thou 'rt i' th' right girl More o' that

Art avised o' that More on 't

You had marred all else

Go to 'tis well away

How now noble Pompey What at the wheels of

Caesar Art thou led in triumph What is there

none of Pygmalion's images newly made woman

to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket

and extracting it clutched What reply ha What

sayst thou to this tune matter and method Is 't not

drowned i' th' last rain ha What sayst thou trot Is

the world as it was man Which is the way Is it sad

and few words Or how The trick of it

How doth my dear morsel thy

mistress Procures she still ha

Why 'tis good It is the right of it It must be so

Ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd an

unshunned consequence it must be so Art going to

prison Pompey

Why 'tis not amiss Pompey Farewell Go say I

sent thee thither For debt Pompey Or how

Well then imprison him If imprisonment be

the due of a bawd why 'tis his right Bawd is he

doubtless and of antiquity too Bawd born

Farewell good Pompey Commend me to the prison

Pompey You will turn good husband now

Pompey you will keep the house

No indeed will I not Pompey it is not the

wear I will pray Pompey to increase your bondage

If you take it not patiently why your mettle is

the more Adieu trusty PompeyBless you friar

Does Bridget paint still Pompey

ha

Then Pompey nor nowWhat news abroad

friar What news

Go to kennel Pompey go

What news friar of the Duke

Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia

other some he is in Rome But where is he think

you

It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal

from the state and usurp the beggary he was never

born to Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence

He puts transgression to 't

A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm

in him Something too crabbed that way friar

Yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred

it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite

friar till eating and drinking be put down They say

this Angelo was not made by man and woman after

this downright way of creation Is it true think

you

Some report a sea-maid spawned him some

that he was begot between two stockfishes But it is

certain that when he makes water his urine is

congealed ice that I know to be true And he is a

motion generative that's infallible

Why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the

rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a

man Would the duke that is absent have done this

Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting

a hundred bastards he would have paid for the

nursing a thousand He had some feeling of the

sport he knew the service and that instructed him

to mercy

O sir you are deceived

Who not the Duke Yes your beggar of fifty

and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish The

Duke had crotchets in him He would be drunk too

that let me inform you

Sir I was an inward of his A shy fellow was the

Duke and I believe I know the cause of his

withdrawing

No pardon 'Tis a secret must be locked within

the teeth and the lips But this I can let you

understand the greater file of the subject held the

Duke to be wise

A very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow

Sir I know him and I love him

Come sir I know what I know

Sir my name is Lucio well known to the Duke

I fear you not

I'll be hanged first Thou art deceived in me

friar But no more of this Canst thou tell if Claudio

die tomorrow or no

Why For filling a bottle with a tundish I would

the Duke we talk of were returned again This

ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with

continency Sparrows must not build in his house

eaves because they are lecherous The Duke yet

would have dark deeds darkly answered He would

never bring them to light Would he were returned

Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing

Farewell good friar I prithee pray for me The

Duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on

Fridays He's now past it yetand I say to thee

he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt

brown bread and garlic Say that I said so Farewell

Good even friar where's the Provost

O pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see

thine eyes so red Thou must be patient I am fain to

dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for my

head fill my belly One fruitful meal would set me to

't But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow By

my troth Isabel I loved thy brother If the old

fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home

he had lived

Friar thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do

He's a better woodman than thou tak'st him for

Nay tarry I'll go along with thee I can tell thee

pretty tales of the Duke

I was once before him for getting a wench with

child

Yes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it

They would else have married me to the rotten

medlar

By my troth I'll go with thee to the lane's end If

bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of it

Nay friar I am a kind of burr I shall stick

That's I an 't like your Grace

I came to her from Claudio and desired her

To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo

For her poor brother's pardon

No my good lord

Nor wished to hold my peace

I warrant your Honor

Right

My lord I know him 'Tis a meddling friar

I do not like the man Had he been lay my lord

For certain words he spake against your Grace

In your retirement I had swinged him soundly

But yesternight my lord she and that friar

I saw them at the prison A saucy friar

A very scurvy fellow

My lord most villainously believe it

My lord she may be a punk for many of them

are neither maid widow nor wife

Well my lord

He was drunk then my lord it can be no better

Well my lord

Carnally she says

Enough my lord

Cucullus non facit monachum honest in nothing

but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most

villainous speeches of the Duke

As any in Vienna on my word

Not better than he by her own report

Marry sir I think if you handled her privately

she would sooner confess perchance publicly she'll

be ashamed

That's the way for women are light at midnight

My lord here comes the rascal I spoke of here

with the Provost

Mum

This is the rascal this is he I spoke of

'Tis he my lordCome hither Goodman Baldpate

Do you know me

O did you so And do you remember what you

said of the Duke

Do you so sir And was the Duke a fleshmonger

a fool and a coward as you then reported him to

be

O thou damnable fellow Did not I pluck thee by

the nose for thy speeches

Come sir come sir

come sir Foh sir Why you bald-pated lying rascal

you must be hooded must you Show your knave's

visage with a pox to you Show your sheep-biting

face and be hanged an hour Will 't not off

This may prove worse than hanging

Faith my lord I spoke it but according to the

trick If you will hang me for it you may but I had

rather it would please you I might be whipped

I beseech your Highness do not marry me to a

whore Your Highness said even now I made you a

duke Good my lord do not recompense me in

making me a cuckold

Marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death

whipping and hanging
