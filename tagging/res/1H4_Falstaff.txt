


Now Hal what time of day is it lad

Indeed you come near me now Hal for we

that take purses go by the moon and the seven

stars and not by Phoebus he that wand'ring

knight so fair And I prithee sweet wag when thou

art king as God save thy GraceMajesty I should

say for grace thou wilt have none

No by my troth not so much as will serve to

be prologue to an egg and butter

Marry then sweet wag when thou art king

let not us that are squires of the night's body be

called thieves of the day's beauty Let us be Diana's

foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the

moon and let men say we be men of good government

being governed as the sea is by our noble

and chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance

we steal

By the Lord thou sayst true lad And is not

my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench

How now how now mad wag What in thy

quips and thy quiddities What a plague have I to

do with a buff jerkin

Well thou hast called her to a reckoning

many a time and oft

No I'll give thee thy due Thou hast paid all

there

Yea and so used it that were it not here

apparent that thou art heir apparentBut I prithee

sweet wag shall there be gallows standing in

England when thou art king And resolution thus

fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic

the law Do not thou when thou art king hang a

thief

Shall I O rare By the Lord I'll be a brave

judge

Well Hal well and in some sort it jumps

with my humor as well as waiting in the court I

can tell you

Yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman

hath no lean wardrobe 'Sblood I am as

melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear

Yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe

Thou hast the most unsavory similes and

art indeed the most comparative rascaliest sweet

young prince But Hal I prithee trouble me no

more with vanity I would to God thou and I knew

where a commodity of good names were to be

bought An old lord of the council rated me the

other day in the street about you sir but I marked

him not and yet he talked very wisely but I

regarded him not and yet he talked wisely and in

the street too

O thou hast damnable iteration and art

indeed able to corrupt a saint Thou hast done

much harm upon me Hal God forgive thee for it

Before I knew thee Hal I knew nothing and now

am I if a man should speak truly little better than

one of the wicked I must give over this life and I

will give it over By the Lord an I do not I am a

villain I'll be damned for never a king's son in

Christendom

Zounds where thou wilt lad I'll make one

An I do not call me villain and baffle me

Why Hal 'tis my vocation Hal 'Tis no sin

for a man to labor in his vocation

PoinsNow shall we know if Gadshill have set a

match O if men were to be saved by merit what

hole in hell were hot enough for him This is the

most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand to

a true man

Hear you Yedward if I tarry at home and

go not I'll hang you for going

Hal wilt thou make one

There's neither honesty manhood nor

good fellowship in thee nor thou cam'st not of

the blood royal if thou darest not stand for ten

shillings

Why that's well said

By the Lord I'll be a traitor then when thou

art king

Well God give thee the spirit of persuasion

and him the ears of profiting that what thou

speakest may move and what he hears may be

believed that the true prince may for recreation

sake prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the

time want countenance Farewell You shall find me

in Eastcheap

Poins Poins and be hanged Poins

Where's Poins Hal

I am accursed to rob in that thief's company

The rascal hath removed my horse and tied him I

know not where If I travel but four foot by the

square further afoot I shall break my wind Well I

doubt not but to die a fair death for all this if I

'scape hanging for killing that rogue I have forsworn

his company hourly any time this two-and-twenty

years and yet I am bewitched with the

rogue's company If the rascal have not given me

medicines to make me love him I'll be hanged It

could not be else I have drunk medicinesPoins

Hal A plague upon you bothBardolph Peto

I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further An 'twere not as

good a deed as drink to turn true man and to leave

these rogues I am the veriest varlet that ever

chewed with a tooth Eight yards of uneven ground

is threescore and ten miles afoot with me and the

stony-hearted villains know it well enough A plague

upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another

Whew A plague upon you

and be hanged

Have you any levers to lift me up again being

far afoot again for all the coin in thy father's Exchequer

What a plague mean you to colt me

thus

I prithee good Prince Hal help me to my

horse good king's son

Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent

garters If I be ta'en I'll peach for this An I have

not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy

tunes let a cup of sack be my poisonwhen a jest

is so forward and afoot too I hate it

So I do against my will

You lie you rogue 'Tis going to the King's

Tavern

To be hanged

You rogue here's lime in this

sack tooThere is nothing but roguery to be

found in villainous man yet a coward is worse than

a cup of sack with lime in it A villainous coward Go

good manhood be not forgot upon the face of the

Earth then am I a shotten herring There lives not

three good men unhanged in England and one of

them is fat and grows old God help the while A bad

world I say I would I were a weaver I could sing

psalms or anything A plague of all cowards I say

still

A king's son If I do not beat thee out of thy

kingdom with a dagger of lath and drive all thy

subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese I'll

never wear hair on my face more You Prince of

Wales

Are not you a coward Answer me to that

and Poins there

I call thee coward I'll see thee damned ere

I call thee coward but I would give a thousand

pound I could run as fast as thou canst You are

sees your back Call you that backing of your

friends A plague upon such backing Give me them

that will face meGive me a cup of sackI am a

rogue if I drunk today

All is one for that A plague of

all cowards still say I

What's the matter There be four of us here

have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning

Where is it Taken from us it is A hundred

upon poor four of us

I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword

with a dozen of them two hours together I have

'scaped by miracle I am eight times thrust through

the doublet four through the hose my buckler

cut through and through my sword hacked like

a handsaw Ecce signum I never dealt better since

I was a man All would not do A plague of

all cowards Let them speak

If they speak more or

less than truth they are villains and the sons of

darkness

Sixteen at least my lord

You rogue they were bound every man of

them or I am a Jew else an Ebrew Jew

And unbound the rest and then come in the

other

All I know not what you call all but if I

fought not with fifty of them I am a bunch of

radish If there were not two- or three-and-fifty

upon poor old Jack then am I no two-legged

creature

Nay that's past praying for I have peppered

two of them Two I am sure I have paid two rogues

in buckram suits I tell thee what Hal if I tell thee a

lie spit in my face call me horse Thou knowest my

old ward Here I lay and thus I bore my point Four

rogues in buckram let drive at me

Four Hal I told thee four

These four came all afront and mainly

thrust at me I made me no more ado but took all

their seven points in my target thus

In buckram

Seven by these hilts or I am a villain else

Dost thou hear me Hal

Do so for it is worth the listening to These

nine in buckram that I told thee of

Their points being broken

Began to give me ground but I followed me

close came in foot and hand and with a thought

seven of the eleven I paid

But as the devil would have it three misbegotten

knaves in Kendal green came at my back

and let drive at me for it was so dark Hal that thou

couldst not see thy hand

What art thou mad Art thou mad Is not

the truth the truth

What upon compulsion Zounds an I were

at the strappado or all the racks in the world I

would not tell you on compulsion Give you a

reason on compulsion If reasons were as plentiful

as blackberries I would give no man a reason upon

compulsion I

'Sblood you starveling you elfskin you

dried neat's tongue you bull's pizzle you stockfish

O for breath to utter what is like thee You tailor's

yard you sheath you bowcase you vile standing

tuck

By the Lord I knew you as well as he that

made you Why hear you my masters was it for

me to kill the heir apparent Should I turn upon the

true prince Why thou knowest I am as valiant as

Hercules but beware instinct The lion will not

touch the true prince Instinct is a great matter

I was now a coward on instinct I shall think

the better of myself and thee during my life

I for a valiant lion and thou for a true prince

But by the Lord lads I am glad you have the

moneyHostess clap to the doorsWatch tonight

pray tomorrow Gallants lads boys hearts

of gold all the titles of good fellowship come to

you What shall we be merry Shall we have a play

extempore

Ah no more of that Hal an thou lovest me

What manner of man is he

What doth Gravity out of his bed at midnight

Shall I give him his answer

Faith and I'll send him packing

My own knee When I was about thy years

Hal I was not an eagle's talon in the waist I could

have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring A

plague of sighing and grief It blows a man up like a

bladder There's villainous news abroad Here was

Sir John Bracy from your father You must to the

court in the morning That same mad fellow of the

north Percy and he of Wales that gave Amamon the

bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore

the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a

Welsh hookwhat a plague call you him

Owen Owen the same and his son-in-law

Mortimer and old Northumberland and that

sprightly Scot of Scots Douglas that runs a-horseback

up a hill perpendicular

You have hit it

Well that rascal hath good mettle in him He

will not run

A-horseback you cuckoo but afoot he will

not budge a foot

I grant you upon instinct Well he is there

too and one Mordake and a thousand blue-caps

more Worcester is stolen away tonight Thy father's

beard is turned white with the news You may buy

land now as cheap as stinking mackerel

By the Mass thou sayest true It is like we

shall have good trading that way But tell me Hal

art not thou horrible afeard Thou being heir

apparent could the world pick thee out three such

enemies again as that fiend Douglas that spirit

Percy and that devil Glendower Art thou not

horribly afraid Doth not thy blood thrill at it

Well thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow

when thou comest to thy father If thou love me

practice an answer

Shall I Content This chair

shall be my state this dagger my scepter and this

cushion my crown

Well an the fire of grace be not quite out of

thee now shalt thou be movedGive me a cup of

sack to make my eyes look red that it may be

thought I have wept for I must speak in passion

and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein

And here is my speech Stand

aside nobility

Weep not sweet queen for trickling tears are vain

For God's sake lords convey my tristful queen

For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes

Peace good pint-pot Peace good tickle-brain

Harry I do not only marvel

where thou spendest thy time but also how thou

art accompanied For though the camomile the

more it is trodden on the faster it grows so youth

the more it is wasted the sooner it wears That

thou art my son I have partly thy mother's word

partly my own opinion but chiefly a villainous

trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy

nether lip that doth warrant me If then thou be

son to me here lies the point why being son to

me art thou so pointed at Shall the blessed sun of

heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries A

question not to be asked Shall the son of England

prove a thief and take purses A question to be

asked There is a thing Harry which thou hast

often heard of and it is known to many in our land

by the name of pitch This pitch as ancient writers

do report doth defile so doth the company thou

keepest For Harry now I do not speak to thee in

drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion

not in words only but in woes also And yet there is

a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy

company but I know not his name

A goodly portly man i' faith and a

corpulent of a cheerful look a pleasing eye and a

most noble carriage and as I think his age some

fifty or by 'r Lady inclining to threescore and now

I remember me his name is Falstaff If that man

should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for Harry

I see virtue in his looks If then the tree may be

known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then

peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that

Falstaff him keep with the rest banish And tell me

now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou

been this month

Depose me If thou dost it half so

gravely so majestically both in word and matter

hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a

poulter's hare

And here I standJudge my masters

My noble lord from Eastcheap

'Sblood my lord they are false

Nay I'll tickle you for a young prince i' faith

I would your Grace would take

me with you Whom means your Grace

My lord the man I know

But to say I know more harm in

him than in myself were to say more than I know

That he is old the more the pity his white hairs do

witness it But that he is saving your reverence a

whoremaster that I utterly deny If sack and sugar

be a fault God help the wicked If to be old and

merry be a sin then many an old host that I know is

damned If to be fat be to be hated then Pharaoh's

lean kine are to be loved No my good lord

banish Peto banish Bardolph banish Poins but for

sweet Jack Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack

Falstaff valiant Jack Falstaff and therefore more

valiant being as he is old Jack Falstaff banish not

him thy Harry's company banish not him thy

Harry's company Banish plump Jack and banish

all the world

Out you roguePlay out the play I have

much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff

Dost thou hear Hal Never call a true piece

of gold a counterfeit Thou art essentially made

without seeming so

I deny your major If you will deny the

Sheriff so if not let him enter If I become not a

cart as well as another man a plague on my

bringing up I hope I shall as soon be strangled with

a halter as another

Both which I have had but their date is out

and therefore I'll hide me

Bardolph am I not fallen away vilely since

this last action Do I not bate Do I not dwindle

Why my skin hangs about me like an old lady's

loose gown I am withered like an old applejohn

Well I'll repent and that suddenly while I am in

some liking I shall be out of heart shortly and then

I shall have no strength to repent An I have not

forgotten what the inside of a church is made of I

am a peppercorn a brewer's horse The inside of a

church Company villainous company hath been

the spoil of me

Why there is it Come sing me a bawdy

song make me merry I was as virtuously given as a

gentleman need to be virtuous enough swore

little diced not above seven timesa week went to

a bawdy house not above once in a quarterof an

hour paid money that I borrowedthree or four

times lived well and in good compass and now I

live out of all order out of all compass

Do thou amend thy face and I'll amend my

life Thou art our admiral thou bearest the lantern

in the poop but 'tis in the nose of thee Thou art the

Knight of the Burning Lamp

No I'll be sworn I make as good use of it as

many a man doth of a death's-head or a memento

mori I never see thy face but I think upon hellfire

and Dives that lived in purple for there he is in his

robes burning burning If thou wert any way given

to virtue I would swear by thy face My oath should

be By this fire that's God's angel But thou art

altogether given over and wert indeed but for the

light in thy face the son of utter darkness When

thou ran'st up Gad's Hill in the night to catch my

horse if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis

fatuus or a ball of wildfire there's no purchase in

money O thou art a perpetual triumph an everlasting

bonfire-light Thou hast saved me a thousand

marks in links and torches walking with thee in the

night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that

thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as

good cheap at the dearest chandler's in Europe I

have maintained that salamander of yours with fire

any time this two-and-thirty years God reward me

for it

Godamercy so should I be sure to be

heartburned

How now Dame Partlet the hen have you enquired

yet who picked my pocket

You lie hostess Bardolph was shaved and

lost many a hair and I'll be sworn my pocket was

picked Go to you are a woman go

Go to I know you well enough

Dowlas filthy dowlas I have given them

away to bakers' wives they have made bolters of

them

He had his part of it

Let him pay

How poor Look upon his face What call

you rich Let them coin his nose Let them coin his

cheeks I'll not pay a denier What will you make a

younker of me Shall I not take mine ease in mine

inn but I shall have my pocket picked I have lost a

seal ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark

How The Prince is a jack a sneak-up

'Sblood an he were here I would cudgel him like a

dog if he would say so

How now lad is the wind in that door i' faith Must

we all march

Prithee let her alone and list to me

The other night I fell asleep here behind the

arras and had my pocket picked This house is

turned bawdy house they pick pockets

Wilt thou believe me Hal three or four

bonds of forty pound apiece and a seal ring of my

grandfather's

There's no more faith in thee than in a

stewed prune nor no more truth in thee than in a

drawn fox and for womanhood Maid Marian may

be the deputy's wife of the ward to thee Go you

thing go

What thing Why a thing to thank God on

Setting thy womanhood aside thou art a

beast to say otherwise

What beast Why an otter

Why she's neither fish nor flesh a man

knows not where to have her

A thousand pound Hal A million Thy love is

worth a million thou owest me thy love

Did I Bardolph

Yea if he said my ring was copper

Why Hal thou knowest as thou art but

man I dare but as thou art prince I fear thee as I

fear the roaring of the lion's whelp

The King himself is to be feared as the lion

Dost thou think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father

Nay an I do I pray God my girdle break

Dost thou hear Hal Thou knowest in the

state of innocency Adam fell and what should poor

Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy Thou seest I

have more flesh than another man and therefore

more frailty You confess then you picked my

pocket

Hostess I forgive thee Go make ready

breakfast love thy husband look to thy servants

cherish thy guests Thou shalt find me tractable

to any honest reason Thou seest I am pacified still

Nay prithee begone Now Hal to

the news at court For the robbery lad how is that

answered

O I do not like that paying back 'Tis a double

labor

Rob me the Exchequer the first thing thou

dost and do it with unwashed hands too

I would it had been of horse Where shall I

find one that can steal well O for a fine thief of

the age of two-and-twenty or thereabouts I am heinously

unprovided Well God be thanked for these

rebels They offend none but the virtuous I laud

them I praise them

Rare words brave worldHostess my breakfast come

O I could wish this tavern were my drum

Bardolph get thee before to Coventry Fill

me a bottle of sack Our soldiers shall march

through We'll to Sutton Coldfield tonight

Lay out lay out

An if it do take it for thy labor An if it make

twenty take them all I'll answer the coinage Bid

my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end

If I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a

soused gurnet I have misused the King's press

damnably I have got in exchange of a hundred

and fifty soldiers three hundred and odd pounds I

press me none but good householders yeomen's

sons inquire me out contracted bachelors such as

had been asked twice on the bannssuch a commodity

of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil

as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse

than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck I pressed me

none but such toasts-and-butter with hearts in their

bellies no bigger than pins' heads and they have

bought out their services and now my whole

charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants

gentlemen of companiesslaves as ragged as Lazarus

in the painted cloth where the glutton's dogs

licked his sores and such as indeed were never

soldiers but discarded unjust servingmen younger

sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters and

ostlers tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and

a long peace ten times more dishonorable-ragged

than an old feazed ancient and such have I to fill up

the rooms of them as have bought out their services

that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty

tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping

from eating draff and husks A mad fellow met me

on the way and told me I had unloaded all the

gibbets and pressed the dead bodies No eye hath

seen such scarecrows I'll not march through Coventry

with them that's flat Nay and the villains

march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on

for indeed I had the most of them out of prison

There's not a shirt and a half in all my company

and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together

and thrown over the shoulders like a herald's coat

without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth

stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red-nose

innkeeper of Daventry But that's all one they'll find

linen enough on every hedge

What Hal how now mad wag What a devil

dost thou in WarwickshireMy good Lord of

Westmoreland I cry you mercy I thought your

Honor had already been at Shrewsbury

Tut never fear me I am as vigilant as a cat to

steal cream

Mine Hal mine

Tut tut good enough to toss food for powder

food for powder They'll fill a pit as well as

better Tush man mortal men mortal men

Faith for their poverty I know not where

they had that and for their bareness I am sure they

never learned that of me

What is the King encamped

Well

To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast

Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest

Rebellion lay in his way and he found it

Hal if thou see me down in the battle and

bestride me so 'tis a point of friendship

I would 'twere bedtime Hal and all well

'Tis not due yet I would be loath to pay Him

before His day What need I be so forward with

Him that calls not on me Well 'tis no matter

Honor pricks me on Yea but how if honor prick me

off when I come on How then Can honor set to a

leg No Or an arm No Or take away the grief of a

wound No Honor hath no skill in surgery then

No What is honor A word What is in that word

honor What is that honor Air A trim reckoning

Who hath it He that died o' Wednesday Doth

he feel it No Doth he hear it No 'Tis insensible

then Yea to the dead But will it not live with the

living No Why Detraction will not suffer it Therefore

I'll none of it Honor is a mere scutcheon And

so ends my catechism

Though I could 'scape shot-free at London

I fear the shot here Here's no scoring but upon

the pateSoft who are you Sir Walter Blunt

There's honor for you Here's no vanity I am as hot

as molten lead and as heavy too God keep lead out

of me I need no more weight than mine own

bowels I have led my ragamuffins where they are

peppered There's not three of my hundred and fifty

left alive and they are for the town's end to beg

during life But who comes here

O Hal I prithee give me leave to breathe

awhile Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms

as I have done this day I have paid Percy I have

made him sure

Nay before God Hal if Percy be alive thou

gett'st not my sword but take my pistol if thou

wilt

Ay Hal 'tis hot 'tis hot There's that will

sack a city

Well if Percy be alive I'll pierce him If he do

come in my way so if he do not if I come in his

willingly let him make a carbonado of me I like not

such grinning honor as Sir Walter hath Give me

life which if I can save so if not honor comes

unlooked for and there's an end

Well said Hal To it Hal Nay you shall find

no boys' play here I can tell you

Emboweled If thou embowel me today I'll

give you leave to powder me and eat me too

tomorrow 'Sblood 'twas time to counterfeit or

that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot

too Counterfeit I lie I am no counterfeit To die is

to be a counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a

man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit

dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no

counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life

indeed The better part of valor is discretion in the

which better part I have saved my life Zounds I am

afraid of this gunpowder Percy though he be dead

How if he should counterfeit too and rise By my

faith I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit

Therefore I'll make him sure yea and I'll swear

I killed him Why may not he rise as well as I

Nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me

Therefore sirrah with a new wound

in your thigh come you along with me

No that's certain I am not a double man

But if I be not Jack Falstaff then am I a jack There

is Percy If your father will do me any honor so if

not let him kill the next Percy himself I look to be

either earl or duke I can assure you

Didst thou Lord Lord how this world is

given to lying I grant you I was down and out of

breath and so was he but we rose both at an instant

and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock If I

may be believed so if not let them that should

reward valor bear the sin upon their own heads I'll

take it upon my death I gave him this wound in

the thigh If the man were alive and would deny

it zounds I would make him eat a piece of my

sword

I'll follow as they say for reward He that

rewards me God reward him If I do grow great

I'll grow less for I'll purge and leave sack and live

cleanly as a nobleman should do
