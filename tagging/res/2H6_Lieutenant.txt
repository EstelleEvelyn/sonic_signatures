


The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day

Is crept into the bosom of the sea

And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades

That drag the tragic melancholy night

Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings

Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws

Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air

Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize

For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs

Here shall they make their ransom on the sand

Or with their blood stain this discolored shore

Master this prisoner freely give I thee

And thou that art his mate make boot of this

The other Walter Whitmore is thy share

What think you much to pay two thousand crowns

And bear the name and port of gentlemen

Cut both the villains' throatsfor die you shall

The lives of those which we have lost in fight

Be counterpoised with such a petty sum

Be not so rash Take ransom let him live

But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be

First let my words stab him as he hath me

Convey him hence and on our longboat's side

Strike off his head

Yes Pole

Pole Sir Pole Lord

Ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt

Troubles the silver spring where England drinks

Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth

For swallowing the treasure of the realm

Thy lips that kissed the Queen shall sweep the ground

And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death

Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain

Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again

And wedded be thou to the hags of hell

For daring to affy a mighty lord

Unto the daughter of a worthless king

Having neither subject wealth nor diadem

By devilish policy art thou grown great

And like ambitious Sylla overgorged

With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart

By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France

The false revolting Normans thorough thee

Disdain to call us lord and Picardy

Hath slain their governors surprised our forts

And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home

The princely Warwick and the Nevilles all

Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain

As hating thee are rising up in arms

And now the house of York thrust from the crown

By shameful murder of a guiltless king

And lofty proud encroaching tyranny

Burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colors

Advance our half-faced sun striving to shine

Under the which is writ Invitis nubibus

The commons here in Kent are up in arms

And to conclude reproach and beggary

Is crept into the palace of our king

And all by theeAway Convey him hence

Walter

Hale him away and let him talk no more

And as for these whose ransom we have set

It is our pleasure one of them depart

Therefore come you with us and let him go
