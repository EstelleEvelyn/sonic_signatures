


I know you well sir and you know me Your

name I think is Adrian

I am a Roman and my services are as you are

against 'em Know you me yet

The same sir

There hath been in Rome strange insurrections

the people against the senators patricians

and nobles

The main blaze of it is past but a small thing

would make it flame again for the nobles receive

so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus

that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power

from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes

forever This lies glowing I can tell you and

is almost mature for the violent breaking out

Banished sir

The day serves well for them now I have heard

it said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is

when she's fall'n out with her husband Your noble

Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars his

great opposer Coriolanus being now in no request

of his country

I shall between this and supper tell you most

strange things from Rome all tending to the good

of their adversaries Have you an army ready say

you

I am joyful to hear of their readiness and am

the man I think that shall set them in present action

So sir heartily well met and most glad of

your company

Well let us go together
