


Perhaps some merchant hath invited him

And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner

Good sister let us dine and never fret

A man is master of his liberty

Time is their master and when they see time

They'll go or come If so be patient sister

Because their business still lies out o' door

O know he is the bridle of your will

Why headstrong liberty is lashed with woe

There's nothing situate under heaven's eye

But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky

The beasts the fishes and the wingd fowls

Are their males' subjects and at their controls

Man more divine the master of all these

Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas

Endued with intellectual sense and souls

Of more preeminence than fish and fowls

Are masters to their females and their lords

Then let your will attend on their accords

Not this but troubles of the marriage bed

Ere I learn love I'll practice to obey

Till he come home again I would forbear

Well I will marry one day but to try

Here comes your man Now is your husband nigh

Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel

his meaning

Quoth who

Fie how impatience loureth in your face

Self-harming jealousy fie beat it hence

How many fond fools serve mad jealousy

Fie brother how the world is changed with you

When were you wont to use my sister thus

She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner

Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner

Why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not

Dromiothou Dromiothou snail thou slug thou sot

If thou art changed to aught 'tis to an ass

Come come Antipholus we dine too late

And may it be that you have quite forgot

A husband's office Shall Antipholus

Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot

Shall love in building grow so ruinous

If you did wed my sister for her wealth

Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness

Or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth 

Muffle your false love with some show of blindness

Let not my sister read it in your eye

Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator

Look sweet speak fair become disloyalty

Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger

Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted

Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint

Be secret-false What need she be acquainted

What simple thief brags of his own attaint

'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed

And let her read it in thy looks at board

Shame hath a bastard fame well managd

Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word

Alas poor women make us but believe

Being compact of credit that you love us

Though others have the arm show us the sleeve

We in your motion turn and you may move us

Then gentle brother get you in again

Comfort my sister cheer her call her wife

'Tis holy sport to be a little vain

When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife

What are you mad that you do reason so

It is a fault that springeth from your eye

Gaze when you should and that will clear your sight

Why call you me love Call my sister so

That's my sister

All this my sister is or else should be

O soft sir Hold you still

I'll fetch my sister to get her goodwill

First he denied you had in him no right

Then swore he that he was a stranger here

Then pleaded I for you

That love I begged for you he begged of me

With words that in an honest suit might move

First he did praise my beauty then my speech

Have patience I beseech

Who would be jealous then of such a one

No evil lost is wailed when it is gone

How hast thou lost thy breath

Alas how fiery and how sharp he looks

And I am witness with her that she did

Ay me poor man how pale and wan he looks

God help poor souls How idly do they talk

God for Thy mercy they are loose again

She never reprehended him but mildly

When he demeaned himself rough rude and wildly

Why bear you these rebukes and answer not

Complain unto the Duke of this indignity

Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey

Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night

But she tells to your Highness simple truth
