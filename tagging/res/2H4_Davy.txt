Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served.

And again, sir: shall we sow the hade land with

wheat?

Yes, sir. Here is now the smith’s note for shoeing

and plow irons.

Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be

had. And, sir, do you mean to stop any of William’s

wages about the sack he lost the other day at

Hinckley Fair?

Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?

No worse than they are back-bitten, sir, for they

have marvelous foul linen.

I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor

of Woncot against Clement Perkes o’ th’ hill.

I grant your Worship that he is a knave, sir, but

yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some

countenance at his friend’s request. An honest

man, sir, is able to speak for himself when a knave is

not. I have served your Worship truly, sir, this eight

years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear

out a knave against an honest man, I have but a

very little credit with your Worship. The knave is

mine honest friend, sir; therefore I beseech you let

him be countenanced.

Sweet sir, sit. I’ll be with you

anon. Most sweet sir, sit. Master page, good master

page, sit. Proface. What you want in meat, we’ll

have in drink, but you must bear. The heart’s all.

There’s a dish of leather-coats for

you.

Your Worship, I’ll be with you straight.—A cup

of wine, sir.

I hope to see London once ere I die.

An ’t please your Worship, there’s one Pistol

come from the court with news.
