


Give me leave Caesar

Thou hast a sister by the mother's side

Admired Octavia Great Mark Antony

Is now a widower

To hold you in perpetual amity

To make you brothers and to knit your hearts

With an unslipping knot take Antony

Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims

No worse a husband than the best of men

Whose virtue and whose general graces speak

That which none else can utter By this marriage

All little jealousies which now seem great

And all great fears which now import their dangers

Would then be nothing Truths would be tales

Where now half-tales be truths Her love to both

Would each to other and all loves to both

Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke

For 'tis a studied not a present thought

By duty ruminated

Good Enobarbus

There she appeared indeed or my reporter

devised well for her

O rare for Antony

Rare Egyptian

Royal wench

She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed

He ploughed her and she cropped

Let us go

Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest

Whilst you abide here

Sir Mark Antony

Will e'en but kiss Octavia and we'll follow

Sir good success

Show 's the way sir

Cup us till the world go round

Cup us till the world go round

What are the brothers parted

'Tis a noble Lepidus

Nay but how dearly he adores Mark Antony

What's Antony The god of Jupiter

O Antony O thou Arabian bird

Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises

Both he loves

Good fortune worthy soldier and farewell

He has a cloud in 's face

Why Enobarbus

When Antony found Julius Caesar dead

He cried almost to roaring And he wept

When at Philippi he found Brutus slain

Who queasy with his insolence already

Will their good thoughts call from him

Who does he accuse

Sir this should be answered

Welcome lady

Caesar I shall

Retire We have engaged ourselves too far

Caesar himself has work and our oppression

Exceeds what we expected

And strange it is

That nature must compel us to lament

Our most persisted deeds

A rarer spirit never

Did steer humanity but you gods will give us

Some faults to make us men Caesar is touched

Dolabella
