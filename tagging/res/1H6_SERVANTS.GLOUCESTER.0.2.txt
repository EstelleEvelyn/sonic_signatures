


Open the gates unto the Lord Protector

Or we'll burst them open if that you come not quickly

My lord we know your Grace to be a man

Just and upright and for your royal birth

Inferior to none but to his Majesty

And ere that we will suffer such a prince

So kind a father of the commonweal

To be disgracd by an inkhorn mate

We and our wives and children all will fight

And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes
