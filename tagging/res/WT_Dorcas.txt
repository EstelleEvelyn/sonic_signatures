To mend her kissing with

He hath promised you more than that or there

be liars

Bless me from marrying a usurer

Is it true too think you

We had the tune on 't a month ago

Whither

Whither

Me too Let me go thither

If to either thou dost ill

What neither

Thou hast sworn my love to be
