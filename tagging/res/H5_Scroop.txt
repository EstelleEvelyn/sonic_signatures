


No doubt my liege if each man do his best

So service shall with steeld sinews toil

And labor shall refresh itself with hope

To do your Grace incessant services

That's mercy but too much security

Let him be punished sovereign lest example

Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind

So did you me my liege

To which we all appeal

Our purposes God justly hath discovered

And I repent my fault more than my death

Which I beseech your Highness to forgive

Although my body pay the price of it
