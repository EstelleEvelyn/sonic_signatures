


What John Rugby

I pray thee go to the casement and see if

you can see my master Master Doctor Caius coming

If he do i' faith and find anybody in the

house here will be an old abusing of God's patience

and the King's English

Go and we'll have a posset for 't

soon at night in faith at the latter end of a seacoal

fire An honest willing kind fellow

as ever servant shall come in house withal and I

warrant you no telltale nor no breed-bate His

worst fault is that he is given to prayer He is something

peevish that way but nobody but has his

fault But let that pass Peter Simple you say your

name is

And Master Slender's your master

Does he not wear a great round

beard like a glover's paring knife

A softly-sprited man is he not

How say you O I should remember

him Does he not hold up his head as it were

and strut in his gait

Well heaven send Anne Page no

worse fortune Tell Master Parson Evans I will do

what I can for your master Anne is a good girl and

I wish

We shall all be shentRun in here

stay long What John Rugby

my master I doubt he be not well that he comes

not home

And down down adown 'a etc

Ay forsooth I'll fetch it you

I am glad he went not in himself If he

had found the young man he would have been

horn-mad

Is it this sir

What John Rugby John

Ay me He'll find the young man

there and be mad

Good master be content

The young man is an honest man

I beseech you be not so phlegmatic

Hear the truth of it He came of an errand to me

from Parson Hugh

Peace I pray you

This is all indeed la But I'll ne'er

put my finger in the fire and need not

I am glad he is so

quiet If he had been throughly moved you should

have heard him so loud and so melancholy But

notwithstanding man I'll do you your master

what good I can And the very yea and the no is

the French doctor my masterI may call him my

master look you for I keep his house and I wash

wring brew bake scour dress meat and drink

that You shall find it a great charge And to be up

early and down late But notwithstandingto tell

you in your ear I would have no words of itmy

master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page

But notwithstanding that I know Anne's mind

That's neither here nor there

Alas he speaks but for his friend

Sir the maid loves you and all shall

be well We must give folks leave to prate What

the goodyear

You shall have Anne

fool's head of your own No I know Anne's mind

for that Never a woman in Windsor knows more

of Anne's mind than I do nor can do more than I

do with her I thank heaven

Who's there I trow Come near the

house I pray you

The better that it pleases your good

Worship to ask

In truth sir and she is pretty and

honest and gentle and one that is your friend I

can tell you that by the way I praise heaven for it

Troth sir all is in His hands above

But notwithstanding Master Fenton I'll be sworn

on a book she loves you Have not your Worship a

wart above your eye

Well thereby hangs a tale Good

faith it is such another Nan But I detest an honest

maid as ever broke bread We had an hour's

talk of that wart I shall never laugh but in that

maid's company But indeed she is given too

much to allicholy and musing But for youwell

go to

Will I I' faith that we will And I

will tell your Worship more of the wart the next

time we have confidence and of other wooers

Farewell to your Worship

Truly an honest gentlemanbut Anne loves him

not for I know Anne's mind as well as another

does Out upon 't What have I forgot

Ay forsooth And I pray how does

good Mistress Anne

Give your Worship good morrow

Not so an 't please your Worship

I'll be swornas my mother was

the first hour I was born

Shall I vouchsafe your Worship a

word or two

There is one Mistress Ford sirI

pray come a little nearer this ways I myself dwell

with Master Doctor Caius

Your Worship says very true I pray

your Worship come a little nearer this ways

Are they so God bless them and

make them His servants

Why sir she's a good creature

Lord Lord your Worship's a wanton Well heaven

forgive you and all of us I pray

Marry this is the short and the long

of it you have brought her into such a canaries as

'tis wonderful The best courtier of them all when

the court lay at Windsor could never have brought

her to such a canary Yet there has been knights

and lords and gentlemen with their coaches I

warrant you coach after coach letter after letter

gift after gift smelling so sweetlyall muskand

so rushling I warrant you in silk and gold and in

such alligant terms and in such wine and sugar of

the best and the fairest that would have won any

woman's heart and I warrant you they could

never get an eye-wink of her I had myself twenty

angels given me this morning but I defy all angels

in any such sort as they say but in the way of

honesty And I warrant you they could never get

her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of

them all And yet there has been earlsnay which

is more pensionersbut I warrant you all is one

with her

Marry she hath received your letter

for the which she thanks you a thousand times

and she gives you to notify that her husband will

be absence from his house between ten and eleven

Ay forsooth and then you may come

and see the picture she says that you wot of Master

Ford her husband will be from home Alas the

sweet woman leads an ill life with him He's a very

jealousy man She leads a very frampold life with

him good heart

Why you say well But I have another

messenger to your Worship Mistress Page

hath her hearty commendations to you too and

let me tell you in your ear she's as fartuous a civil

modest wife and one I tell you that will not miss

you morning nor evening prayer as any is in Windsor

whoe'er be the other And she bade me tell

your Worship that her husband is seldom from

home but she hopes there will come a time I

never knew a woman so dote upon a man Surely I

think you have charms la Yes in truth

Blessing on your heart for 't

That were a jest indeed They have

not so little grace I hope That were a trick indeed

But Mistress Page would desire you to send her

your little page of all loves Her husband has a

marvelous infection to the little page and truly

Master Page is an honest man Never a wife in

Windsor leads a better life than she does Do what

she will say what she will take all pay all go to

bed when she list rise when she listall is as she

will And truly she deserves it for if there be a

kind woman in Windsor she is one You must send

her your page no remedy

Nay but do so then and look you

he may come and go between you both And in any

case have a nayword that you may know one another's

mind and the boy never need to understand

anything for 'tis not good that children

should know any wickedness Old folks you know

have discretion as they say and know the world

Hark ye Master Slender

would speak a word with you

And how does good Master Fenton

Pray you a word with you

Speak to Mistress Page

That's my master Master Doctor

This is my doing now Nay said I

will you cast away your child on a fool and a

physician Look on Master Fenton This is my

doing

Now heaven send thee good fortune

A kind heart he hath A woman would run through

fire and water for such a kind heart But yet I

would my master had Mistress Anne or I would

Master Slender had her or in sooth I would Master

Fenton had her I will do what I can for them all

three for so I have promised and I'll be as good as

my wordbut speciously for Master Fenton Well

I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from

my two mistresses What a beast am I to slack it

By your leave I cry you mercy Give

your Worship good morrow

Marry sir I come to your Worship

from Mistress Ford

Alas the day good heart that was

not her fault She does so take on with her men

they mistook their erection

Well she laments sir for it that it

would yearn your heart to see it Her husband goes

this morning a-birding she desires you once more

to come to her between eight and nine I must

carry her word quickly She'll make you amends I

warrant you

I will tell her

Eight and nine sir

Peace be with you sir

Sure he is by this or will be presently

But truly he is very courageous mad about

his throwing into the water Mistress Ford desires

you to come suddenly

Blessing of his heart

Truly I thought there had been one

number more because they say  'Od's nouns

Polecats There are fairer things

than polecats sure

Hang-hog is Latin for bacon I

warrant you

And that's a good root

Vengeance of Ginny's case Fie on

her Never name her child if she be a whore

You do ill to teach the child such

wordsHe teaches him to hick and to hack

which they'll do fast enough of themselves and to

call whorumFie upon you

From the two parties forsooth

And have not they suffered Yes I

warrant speciously one of them Mistress Ford

good heart is beaten black and blue that you cannot

see a white spot about her

Sir let me speak with you in your

chamber You shall hear how things go and I warrant

to your content Here is a letter will say

somewhat Good hearts

what ado here is to bring you together Sure one

of you does not serve heaven well that you are so

crossed

I'll provide you a chain and I'll do

what I can to get you a pair of horns

Fairies black gray green and white

You moonshine revelers and shades of night

You orphan heirs of fixd destiny

Attend your office and your quality

Crier Hobgoblin make the fairy oyes

About about

Search Windsor Castle elves within and out

Strew good luck aufs on every sacred room

That it may stand till the perpetual doom

In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit

Worthy the owner and the owner it

The several chairs of order look you scour

With juice of balm and every precious flower

Each fair installment coat and sev'ral crest

With loyal blazon evermore be blest

And nightly meadow fairies look you sing

Like to the Garter's compass in a ring

Th' expressure that it bears green let it be

More fertile-fresh than all the field to see

And Honi soit qui mal y pense write

In em'rald tufts flowers purple blue and white

Like sapphire pearl and rich embroidery

Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee

Fairies use flowers for their charactery

Away disperse But till 'tis one o'clock

Our dance of custom round about the oak

Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget

With trial-fire touch me his finger-end

If he be chaste the flame will back descend

And turn him to no pain But if he start

It is the flesh of a corrupted heart

Corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire

About him fairies Sing a scornful rhyme

And as you trip still pinch him to your time

Fie on sinful fantasy

Fie on lust and luxury

Lust is but a bloody fire

Kindled with unchaste desire

Fed in heart whose flames aspire

As thoughts do blow them higher and higher

Pinch him fairies mutually

Pinch him for his villainy

Pinch him and burn him and turn him about

Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out
