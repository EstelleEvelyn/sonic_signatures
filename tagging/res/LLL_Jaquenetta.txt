Lord, how wise you are.

With that face?

Fair weather after you.

God give you good morrow,

Master Person.

Good Master Parson, be so

good as read me this letter. It was given me by

Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech

you, read it.

Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one

of the strange queen’s lords.

Good Costard, go with me.—Sir, God

save your life.

God bless the King.

I beseech your Grace, let this letter be read.

Our person misdoubts it. ’Twas treason, he said.

Of Costard.
