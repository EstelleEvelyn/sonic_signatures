


O my good lord I have been your tenant

And your father's tenant these fourscore years

You cannot see your way

How now Who's there

'Tis poor mad Tom

Fellow where goest

Madman and beggar too

Ay my lord

Alack sir he is mad

I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have

Come on 't what will
