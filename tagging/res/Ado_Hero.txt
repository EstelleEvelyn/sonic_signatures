


My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua

He is of a very melancholy disposition

So you walk softly and look sweetly and say

nothing I am yours for the walk and especially

when I walk away

I may say so when I please

When I like your favor for God defend the lute

should be like the case

Why then your visor should be thatched

I will do any modest office my lord to help my

cousin to a good husband

Good Margaret run thee to the parlor

There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice

Proposing with the Prince and Claudio

Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula

Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse

Is all of her Say that thou overheardst us

And bid her steal into the pleachd bower

Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun

Forbid the sun to enter like favorites

Made proud by princes that advance their pride

Against that power that bred it There will she hide her

To listen our propose This is thy office

Bear thee well in it and leave us alone

Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come

As we do trace this alley up and down

Our talk must only be of Benedick

When I do name him let it be thy part

To praise him more than ever man did merit

My talk to thee must be how Benedick

Is sick in love with Beatrice Of this matter

Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made

That only wounds by hearsay Now begin

For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs

Close by the ground to hear our conference

Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing

Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it

No truly Ursula she is too disdainful

I know her spirits are as coy and wild

As haggards of the rock

So says the Prince and my new-trothd lord

They did entreat me to acquaint her of it

But I persuaded them if they loved Benedick

To wish him wrestle with affection

And never to let Beatrice know of it

O god of love I know he doth deserve

As much as may be yielded to a man

But Nature never framed a woman's heart

Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice

Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes

Misprizing what they look on and her wit

Values itself so highly that to her

All matter else seems weak She cannot love

Nor take no shape nor project of affection

She is so self-endeared

Why you speak truth I never yet saw man

How wise how noble young how rarely featured

But she would spell him backward If fair-faced

She would swear the gentleman should be her sister

If black why Nature drawing of an antic

Made a foul blot if tall a lance ill-headed

If low an agate very vilely cut

If speaking why a vane blown with all winds

If silent why a block moved with none

So turns she every man the wrong side out

And never gives to truth and virtue that

Which simpleness and merit purchaseth

No not to be so odd and from all fashions

As Beatrice is cannot be commendable

But who dare tell her so If I should speak

She would mock me into air O she would laugh me

Out of myself press me to death with wit

Therefore let Benedick like covered fire

Consume away in sighs waste inwardly

It were a better death than die with mocks

Which is as bad as die with tickling

No rather I will go to Benedick

And counsel him to fight against his passion

And truly I'll devise some honest slanders

To stain my cousin with One doth not know

How much an ill word may empoison liking

He is the only man of Italy

Always excepted my dear Claudio

Indeed he hath an excellent good name

Why every day tomorrow Come go in

I'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel

Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow

If it prove so then loving goes by haps

Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps

Good Ursula wake my cousin Beatrice and

desire her to rise

And bid her come hither

No pray thee good Meg I'll wear this

My cousin's a fool and thou art another I'll

wear none but this

O that exceeds they say

God give me joy to wear it for my heart is

exceeding heavy

Fie upon thee Art not ashamed

Good morrow coz

Why how now Do you speak in the sick tune

These gloves the Count sent me they are an

excellent perfume

There thou prick'st her with a thistle

Help to dress me good coz good Meg good

Ursula

I do

None my lord

And seemed I ever otherwise to you

Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide

True O God

O God defend me how am I beset

What kind of catechizing call you this

Is it not Hero Who can blot that name

With any just reproach

I talked with no man at that hour my lord

They know that do accuse me I know none

If I know more of any man alive

Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant

Let all my sins lack mercyO my father

Prove you that any man with me conversed

At hours unmeet or that I yesternight

Maintained the change of words with any creature

Refuse me hate me torture me to death

And when I lived I was your other wife

And when you loved you were my other husband

Nothing certainer

One Hero died defiled but I do live

And surely as I live I am a maid

And here's another

Writ in my cousin's hand stol'n from her pocket

Containing her affection unto Benedick
