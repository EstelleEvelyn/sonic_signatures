I have been sometimes there.

What’s your will?

The King’s not here.

Not indeed.

He hence removed last night, and with more haste

Than is his use.

Marry, as I take it, to Rossillion,

Whither I am going.

This I’ll do for you.

Gracious sovereign,

Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.

Here’s a petition from a Florentine

Who hath for four or five removes come short

To tender it herself. I undertook it,

Vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech

Of the poor suppliant, who, by this, I know

Is here attending. Her business looks in her

With an importing visage, and she told me,

In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern

Your Highness with herself.
