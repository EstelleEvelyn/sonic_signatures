I saw no man use you at his pleasure If I had

my weapon should quickly have been out I warrant

you I dare draw as soon as another man if I

see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my

side

Anon

Musicians O musicians Heart's ease

Heart's ease O an you will have me live play

Heart's ease

O musicians because my heart itself plays My

heart is full O play me some merry dump to

comfort me

You will not then

I will then give it you soundly

No money on my faith but the gleek I will give

you the minstrel

Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on

your pate I will carry no crochets I'll re you I'll fa

you Do you note me

Then have at you with my wit I will dry-beat

you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger

Answer me like men

When griping griefs the heart doth wound

And doleful dumps the mind oppress

Then music with her silver sound

Why silver sound Why music with her silver

sound What say you Simon Catling

PratesWhat say you Hugh Rebeck

Prates tooWhat say you James Soundpost

O I cry you mercy You are the singer I will say

for you It is music with her silver sound because

musicians have no gold for sounding

Then music with her silver sound

With speedy help doth lend redress
