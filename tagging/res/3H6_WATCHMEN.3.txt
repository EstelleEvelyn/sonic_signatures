That with the King here resteth in his tent

O is it so But why commands the King

That his chief followers lodge in towns about him

While he himself keeps in the cold field

Ay but give me worship and quietness

I like it better than a dangerous honor

If Warwick knew in what estate he stands

'Tis to be doubted he would waken him
