And since I have not much importuned you,

Nor now I had not, but that I am bound

To Persia and want guilders for my voyage.

Therefore make present satisfaction,

Or I’ll attach you by this officer.

The hour steals on. I pray you, sir, dispatch.

My business cannot brook this dalliance.

Good sir, say whe’er you’ll answer me or no.

If not, I’ll leave him to the Officer.

Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

How is the man esteemed here in the city?

Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks.

Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

These ears of mine, thou know’st, did hear thee.

Fie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st

To walk where any honest men resort.

I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

By this, I think, the dial points at five.

Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person

Comes this way to the melancholy vale,

The place of death and sorry execution

Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,

Who put unluckily into this bay

Against the laws and statutes of this town,

Beheaded publicly for his offense.

Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine

Heard you confess you had the chain of him

After you first forswore it on the mart,

And thereupon I drew my sword on you,

And then you fled into this abbey here,

From whence I think you are come by miracle.
