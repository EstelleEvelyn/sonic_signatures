


Not here in presence

Your brother kings and monarchs of the Earth

Do all expect that you should rouse yourself

As did the former lions of your blood

It follows then the cat must stay at home

Yet that is but a crushed necessity

Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries

And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves

While that the armd hand doth fight abroad

Th' advisd head defends itself at home

For government though high and low and lower

Put into parts doth keep in one consent

Congreeing in a full and natural close

Like music

Tennis balls my liege

This was a merry message

They shall be apprehended by and by

Nay but the man that was his bedfellow

Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors

That he should for a foreign purse so sell

His sovereign's life to death and treachery

I arrest thee of high treason by the name of

Richard Earl of Cambridge

I arrest thee of high treason by the name of

Henry Lord Scroop of Masham

I arrest thee of high treason by the name of

Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland

From him and thus he greets your Majesty

He wills you in the name of God almighty

That you divest yourself and lay apart

The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven

By law of nature and of nations 'longs

To him and to his heirsnamely the crown

And all wide-stretchd honors that pertain

By custom and the ordinance of times

Unto the crown of France That you may know

'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim

Picked from the wormholes of long-vanished days

Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked

He sends you this most memorable line

In every branch truly demonstrative

Willing you overlook this pedigree

And when you find him evenly derived

From his most famed of famous ancestors

Edward the Third he bids you then resign

Your crown and kingdom indirectly held

From him the native and true challenger

Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown

Even in your hearts there will he rake for it

Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming

In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove

That if requiring fail he will compel

And bids you in the bowels of the Lord

Deliver up the crown and to take mercy

On the poor souls for whom this hungry war

Opens his vasty jaws and on your head

Turning the widows' tears the orphans' cries

The dead men's blood the privd maidens' groans

For husbands fathers and betrothd lovers

That shall be swallowed in this controversy

This is his claim his threat'ning and my message

Unless the Dauphin be in presence here

To whom expressly I bring greeting too

Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt

And anything that may not misbecome

The mighty sender doth he prize you at

Thus says my king an if your father's Highness

Do not in grant of all demands at large

Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty

He'll call you to so hot an answer of it

That caves and womby vaultages of France

Shall chide your trespass and return your mock

In second accent of his ordinance

He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it

Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe

And be assured you'll find a difference

As we his subjects have in wonder found

Between the promise of his greener days

And these he masters now Now he weighs time

Even to the utmost grain That you shall read

In your own losses if he stay in France

Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king

Come here himself to question our delay

For he is footed in this land already

There's five to one Besides they all are fresh

Farewell kind lord Fight valiantly today

The Duke of York commends him to your Majesty

In which array brave soldier doth he lie

Larding the plain and by his bloody side

Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds

The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies

Suffolk first died and York all haggled over

Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped

And takes him by the beard kisses the gashes

That bloodily did yawn upon his face

He cries aloud Tarry my cousin Suffolk

My soul shall thine keep company to heaven

Tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast

As in this glorious and well-foughten field

We kept together in our chivalry

Upon these words I came and cheered him up

He smiled me in the face raught me his hand

And with a feeble grip says Dear my lord

Commend my service to my sovereign

So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck

He threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips

And so espoused to death with blood he sealed

A testament of noble-ending love

The pretty and sweet manner of it forced

Those waters from me which I would have stopped

But I had not so much of man in me

And all my mother came into mine eyes

And gave me up to tears

Here comes the herald of the French my liege

Soldier you must come to the King

Charles Duke of Orlans nephew to the King

John Duke of Bourbon and Lord Bouciqualt

Of other lords and barons knights and squires

Full fifteen hundred besides common men

'Tis wonderful

Only he hath not yet subscribd this

Where your Majesty demands that the King of

France having any occasion to write for matter of

grant shall name your Highness in this form and

with this addition in French Notre trs cher fils

Henri roi d' Angleterre hritier de France and thus

in Latin Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus rex

Angliae et hres Franciae

Amen
