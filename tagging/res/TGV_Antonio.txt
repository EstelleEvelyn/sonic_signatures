


Tell me Pantino what sad talk was that

Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister

Why what of him

Nor need'st thou much importune me to that

Whereon this month I have been hammering

I have considered well his loss of time

And how he cannot be a perfect man

Not being tried and tutored in the world

Experience is by industry achieved

And perfected by the swift course of time

Then tell me whither were I best to send him

I know it well

I like thy counsel Well hast thou advised

And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it

The execution of it shall make known

Even with the speediest expedition

I will dispatch him to the Emperor's court

Good company With them shall Proteus go

And in good time Now will we break with him

How now What letter are you reading there

Lend me the letter Let me see what news

And how stand you affected to his wish

My will is something sorted with his wish

Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed

For what I will I will and there an end

I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time

With Valentinus in the Emperor's court

What maintenance he from his friends receives

Like exhibition thou shalt have from me

Tomorrow be in readiness to go

Excuse it not for I am peremptory

Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee

No more of stay Tomorrow thou must go

Come on Pantino you shall be employed

To hasten on his expedition
