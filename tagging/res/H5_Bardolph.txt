What are Ancient Pistol and you friends

I will bestow a breakfast to make you

friends and we'll be all three sworn brothers to

France Let 't be so good Corporal Nym

It is certain corporal that he is married to

Nell Quickly and certainly she did you wrong for

you were troth-plight to her

Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife

Good corporal be patient hereHow now mine

host Pistol

Good lieutenant good corporal offer nothing

here

Hear me hear me what I say he that strikes

the first stroke I'll run him up to the hilts as I am a

soldier

Away you rogue

Come shall I make you two friends We

must to France together Why the devil should we

keep knives to cut one another's throats

By this sword he that

makes the first thrust I'll kill him By this sword I

will

Corporal Nym an thou wilt be friends be
