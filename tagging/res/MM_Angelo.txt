


Always obedient to your Grace's will

I come to know your pleasure

Now good my lord

Let there be some more test made of my mettle

Before so noble and so great a figure

Be stamped upon it

Yet give leave my lord

That we may bring you something on the way

The heavens give safety to your purposes

'Tis so with me Let us withdraw together

And we may soon our satisfaction have

Touching that point

We must not make a scarecrow of the law

Setting it up to fear the birds of prey

And let it keep one shape till custom make it

Their perch and not their terror

'Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus

Another thing to fall I not deny

The jury passing on the prisoner's life

May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two

Guiltier than him they try What's open made to justice

That justice seizes What knows the laws

That thieves do pass on thieves 'Tis very pregnant

The jewel that we find we stoop and take 't

Because we see it but what we do not see

We tread upon and never think of it

You may not so extenuate his offense

For I have had such faults but rather tell me

When I that censure him do so offend

Let mine own judgment pattern out my death

And nothing come in partial Sir he must die

Where is the Provost

See that Claudio

Be executed by nine tomorrow morning

Bring him his confessor let him be prepared

For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage

How now sir what's your name And what's

the matter

Benefactors Well what benefactors are they

Are they not malefactors

Go to What quality are they of

Elbow is your name Why dost thou not speak

Elbow

What are you sir

This will last out a night in Russia

When nights are longest there I'll take my leave

And leave you to the hearing of the cause

Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all

Now what's the matter provost

Did not I tell thee yea Hadst thou not order

Why dost thou ask again

Go to Let that be mine

Do you your office or give up your place

And you shall well be spared

Dispose of her

To some more fitter place and that with speed

Hath he a sister

Well let her be admitted

See you the fornicatress be removed

Let her have needful but not lavish means

There shall be order for 't

Stay a little while You're welcome

What's your will

Well what's your suit

Well the matter

Condemn the fault and not the actor of it

Why every fault's condemned ere it be done

Mine were the very cipher of a function

To fine the faults whose fine stands in record

And let go by the actor

Maiden no remedy

I will not do 't

Look what I will not that I cannot do

He's sentenced 'Tis too late

Pray you begone

Your brother is a forfeit of the law

And you but waste your words

Be you content fair maid

It is the law not I condemn your brother

Were he my kinsman brother or my son

It should be thus with him He must die tomorrow

The law hath not been dead though it hath slept

Those many had not dared to do that evil

If the first that did th' edict infringe

Had answered for his deed Now 'tis awake

Takes note of what is done and like a prophet

Looks in a glass that shows what future evils

Either now or by remissness new-conceived

And so in progress to be hatched and born

Are now to have no successive degrees

But ere they live to end

I show it most of all when I show justice

For then I pity those I do not know

Which a dismissed offense would after gall

And do him right that answering one foul wrong

Lives not to act another Be satisfied

Your brother dies tomorrow be content

Why do you put these sayings upon me

She speaks and 'tis such sense

That my sense breeds with it Fare you well

I will bethink me Come again tomorrow

How Bribe me

Well come to me tomorrow

Amen

For I am that way going to temptation

Where prayers cross

At any time 'fore noon

From thee even from thy virtue

What's this What's this Is this her fault or mine

The tempter or the tempted who sins most ha

Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I

That lying by the violet in the sun

Do as the carrion does not as the flower

Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be

That modesty may more betray our sense

Than woman's lightness Having waste ground enough

Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary

And pitch our evils there O fie fie fie

What dost thou or what art thou Angelo

Dost thou desire her foully for those things

That make her good O let her brother live

Thieves for their robbery have authority

When judges steal themselves What do I love her

That I desire to hear her speak again

And feast upon her eyes What is 't I dream on

O cunning enemy that to catch a saint

With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous

Is that temptation that doth goad us on

To sin in loving virtue Never could the strumpet

With all her double vigor art and nature

Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid

Subdues me quite Ever till now

When men were fond I smiled and wondered how

When I would pray and think I think and pray

To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words

Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue

Anchors on Isabel God in my mouth

As if I did but only chew His name

And in my heart the strong and swelling evil

Of my conception The state whereon I studied

Is like a good thing being often read

Grown sere and tedious Yea my gravity

Whereinlet no man hear meI take pride

Could I with boot change for an idle plume

Which the air beats for vain O place O form

How often dost thou with thy case thy habit

Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls

To thy false seeming Blood thou art blood

Let's write good angel on the devil's horn

'Tis not the devil's crest How now who's there

Teach her the way O heavens

Why does my blood thus muster to my heart

Making both it unable for itself

And dispossessing all my other parts

Of necessary fitness

So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons

Come all to help him and so stop the air

By which he should revive And even so

The general subject to a well-wished king

Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness

Crowd to his presence where their untaught love

Must needs appear offense    How now fair maid

That you might know it would much better please me

Than to demand what 'tis Your brother cannot live

Yet may he live a while And it may be

As long as you or I Yet he must die

Yea

Ha Fie these filthy vices It were as good

To pardon him that hath from nature stolen

A man already made as to remit

Their saucy sweetness that do coin God's image

In stamps that are forbid 'Tis all as easy

Falsely to take away a life true made

As to put metal in restraind means

To make a false one

Say you so Then I shall pose you quickly

Which had you rather that the most just law

Now took your brother's life or to redeem him

Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness

As she that he hath stained

I talk not of your soul Our compelled sins

Stand more for number than for accompt

Nay I'll not warrant that for I can speak

Against the thing I say Answer to this

I now the voice of the recorded law

Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life

Might there not be a charity in sin

To save this brother's life

Pleased you to do 't at peril of your soul

Were equal poise of sin and charity

Nay but hear me

Your sense pursues not mine Either you are ignorant

Or seem so crafty and that's not good

Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright

When it doth tax itself as these black masks

Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder

Than beauty could displayed But mark me

To be receivd plain I'll speak more gross

Your brother is to die

And his offense is so as it appears

Accountant to the law upon that pain

Admit no other way to save his life

As I subscribe not that nor any other

But in the loss of question that you his sister

Finding yourself desired of such a person

Whose credit with the judge or own great place

Could fetch your brother from the manacles

Of the  law and that there were

No earthly mean to save him but that either

You must lay down the treasures of your body

To this supposed or else to let him suffer

What would you do

Then must your brother die

Were not you then as cruel as the sentence

That you have slandered so

You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant

And rather proved the sliding of your brother

A merriment than a vice

We are all frail

Nay women are frail too

I think it well

And from this testimony of your own sex

Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger

Than faults may shake our frames let me be bold

I do arrest your words Be that you are

That is a woman If you be more you're none

If you be one as you are well expressed

By all external warrants show it now

By putting on the destined livery

Plainly conceive I love you

He shall not Isabel if you give me love

Believe me on mine honor

My words express my purpose

Who will believe thee Isabel

My unsoiled name th' austereness of my life

My vouch against you and my place i' th' state

Will so your accusation overweigh

That you shall stifle in your own report

And smell of calumny I have begun

And now I give my sensual race the rein

Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite

Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes

That banish what they sue for Redeem thy brother

By yielding up thy body to my will

Or else he must not only die the death

But thy unkindness shall his death draw out

To ling'ring sufferance Answer me tomorrow

Or by the affection that now guides me most

I'll prove a tyrant to him As for you

Say what you can my false o'erweighs your true

In most uneven and distracted manner His

actions show much like to madness Pray heaven his

wisdom be not tainted And why meet him at the

gates and deliver our authorities there

And why should we proclaim it in an hour

before his entering that if any crave redress of

injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the

street

Well I beseech you let it be proclaimed

Betimes i' th' morn I'll call you at your house Give

notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet

him

Good night

This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant

And dull to all proceedings A deflowered maid

And by an eminent body that enforced

The law against it But that her tender shame

Will not proclaim against her maiden loss

How might she tongue me Yet reason dares her no

For my authority bears of a credent bulk

That no particular scandal once can touch

But it confounds the breather He should have lived

Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense

Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge

By so receiving a dishonored life

With ransom of such shame Would yet he had lived

Alack when once our grace we have forgot

Nothing goes right We would and we would not

Happy return be to your royal Grace

You make my bonds still greater

My lord her wits I fear me are not firm

She hath been a suitor to me for her brother

Cut off by course of justice

And she will speak most bitterly and strange

Charges she more than me

This is a strange abuse Let's see thy face

My lord I must confess I know this woman

And five years since there was some speech of marriage

Betwixt myself and her which was broke off

Partly for that her promisd proportions

Came short of composition but in chief

For that her reputation was disvalued

In levity Since which time of five years

I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her

Upon my faith and honor

I did but smile till now

Now good my lord give me the scope of justice

My patience here is touched I do perceive

These poor informal women are no more

But instruments of some more mightier member

That sets them on Let me have way my lord

To find this practice out

What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio

Is this the man that you did tell us of

Hark how the villain would close now after

his treasonable abuses

What resists heHelp him Lucio

O my dread lord

I should be guiltier than my guiltiness

To think I can be undiscernible

When I perceive your Grace like power divine

Hath looked upon my passes Then good prince

No longer session hold upon my shame

But let my trial be mine own confession

Immediate sentence then and sequent death

Is all the grace I beg

I was my lord

I am sorry that such sorrow I procure

And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart

That I crave death more willingly than mercy

'Tis my deserving and I do entreat it
