Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!

The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose,

But him outlive and die a violent death.

By water shall he die and take his end.

Let him shun castles.

Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains

Than where castles mounted stand.

Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
