
His Majesty

Tend'ring my person's safety hath appointed

This conduct to convey me to the Tower

Because my name is George

Yea Richard when I know for I protest

As yet I do not But as I can learn

He hearkens after prophecies and dreams

And from the crossrow plucks the letter G

And says a wizard told him that by G

His issue disinherited should be

And for my name of George begins with G

It follows in his thought that I am he

These as I learn and such like toys as these

Hath moved his Highness to commit me now

By heaven I think there is no man secure

But the Queen's kindred and night-walking heralds

That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore

Heard you not what an humble suppliant

Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery

We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey

I know it pleaseth neither of us well

I must perforce Farewell

O I have passed a miserable night

So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights

That as I am a Christian faithful man

I would not spend another such a night

Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days

So full of dismal terror was the time

Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower

And was embarked to cross to Burgundy

And in my company my brother Gloucester

Who from my cabin tempted me to walk

Upon the hatches Thence we looked toward England

And cited up a thousand heavy times

During the wars of York and Lancaster

That had befall'n us As we paced along

Upon the giddy footing of the hatches

Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling

Struck me that thought to stay him overboard

Into the tumbling billows of the main

O Lord methought what pain it was to drown

What dreadful noise of waters in my ears

What sights of ugly death within my eyes

Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks

A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon

Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl

Inestimable stones unvalued jewels

All scattered in the bottom of the sea

Some lay in dead men's skulls and in the holes

Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept

As 'twere in scorn of eyesreflecting gems

That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep

And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by

Methought I had and often did I strive

To yield the ghost but still the envious flood

Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth

To find the empty vast and wand'ring air

But smothered it within my panting bulk

Who almost burst to belch it in the sea

No no my dream was lengthened after life

O then began the tempest to my soul

I passed methought the melancholy flood

With that sour ferryman which poets write of

Unto the kingdom of perpetual night

The first that there did greet my stranger-soul

Was my great father-in-law renownd Warwick

Who spake aloud What scourge for perjury

Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence

And so he vanished Then came wand'ring by

A shadow like an angel with bright hair

Dabbled in blood and he shrieked out aloud

Clarence is comefalse fleeting perjured Clarence

That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury

Seize on him furies Take him unto torment

With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends

Environed me and howld in mine ears

Such hideous cries that with the very noise

I trembling waked and for a season after

Could not believe but that I was in hell

Such terrible impression made my dream

Ah keeper keeper I have done these things

That now give evidence against my soul

For Edward's sake and see how he requites me

O God if my deep prayers cannot appease thee

But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds

Yet execute thy wrath in me alone

O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children

Keeper I prithee sit by me awhile

My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep

Where art thou keeper Give me a cup of wine

In God's name what art thou

But not as I am royal

Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble

How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak

Your eyes do menace me Why look you pale

Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come

To murder me

You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so

And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it

Wherein my friends have I offended you

I shall be reconciled to him again

Are you drawn forth among a world of men

To slay the innocent What is my offense

Where is the evidence that doth accuse me

What lawful quest have given their verdict up

Unto the frowning judge Or who pronounced

The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death

Before I be convict by course of law

To threaten me with death is most unlawful

I charge you as you hope to have redemption

By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins

That you depart and lay no hands on me

The deed you undertake is damnable

Erroneous vassals the great King of kings

Hath in the table of His law commanded

That thou shalt do no murder Will you then

Spurn at His edict and fulfill a man's

Take heed for He holds vengeance in His hand

To hurl upon their heads that break His law

Alas For whose sake did I that ill deed

For Edward for my brother for his sake

He sends you not to murder me for this

For in that sin he is as deep as I

If God will be avengd for the deed

O know you yet He doth it publicly

Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm

He needs no indirect or lawless course

To cut off those that have offended Him

My brother's love the devil and my rage

If you do love my brother hate not me

I am his brother and I love him well

If you are hired for meed go back again

And I will send you to my brother Gloucester

Who shall reward you better for my life

Than Edward will for tidings of my death

O no he loves me and he holds me dear

Go you to him from me

Tell him when that our princely father York

Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm

He little thought of this divided friendship

Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep

O do not slander him for he is kind

It cannot be for he bewept my fortune

And hugged me in his arms and swore with sobs

That he would labor my delivery

Have you that holy feeling in your souls

To counsel me to make my peace with God

And are you yet to your own souls so blind

That you will war with God by murd'ring me

O sirs consider they that set you on

To do this deed will hate you for the deed

Relent and save your souls

Which of youif you were a prince's son

Being pent from liberty as I am now

If two such murderers as yourselves came to you

Would not entreat for life Ay you would beg

Were you in my distress

Not to relent is beastly savage devilish

My friend I spy some pity in thy looks

O if thine eye be not a flatterer

Come thou on my side and entreat for me

A begging prince what beggar pities not

Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow

I that was washed to death with fulsome wine

Poor Clarence by thy guile betrayed to death

Tomorrow in the battle think on me

And fall thy edgeless sword Despair and die

Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster

The wrongd heirs of York do pray for thee

Good angels guard thy battle Live and flourish
