
An ’t please your Honor, players

That offer service to your Lordship.

Will ’t please your Lord drink a cup of sack?

Say thou wilt course. Thy greyhounds are as swift

As breathèd stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.

And till the tears that she hath shed for thee

Like envious floods o’errun her lovely face,

She was the fairest creature in the world—

And yet she is inferior to none.

Oh, yes, my lord, but very idle words.

For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,

Yet would you say you were beaten out of door,

And rail upon the hostess of the house,

And say you would present her at the leet

Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts.

Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

Amen.

My lord, you nod. You do not mind the play.
