


I would not be thy executioner

I fly thee for I would not injure thee

Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye

'Tis pretty sure and very probable

That eyes that are the frail'st and softest things

Who shut their coward gates on atomies

Should be called tyrants butchers murderers

Now I do frown on thee with all my heart

And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee

Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down

Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame

Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers

Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee

Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains

Some scar of it Lean upon a rush

The cicatrice and capable impressure

Thy palm some moment keeps But now mine eyes

Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not

Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes

That can do hurt

But till that time

Come not thou near me And when that time comes

Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not

As till that time I shall not pity thee

Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together

I had rather hear you chide than this man woo

For no ill will I bear you

Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might

Who ever loved that loved not at first sight

Ha what sayst thou Silvius

Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius

Thou hast my love Is not that neighborly

Why that were covetousness

Silvius the time was that I hated thee

And yet it is not that I bear thee love

But since that thou canst talk of love so well

Thy company which erst was irksome to me

I will endure and I'll employ thee too

But do not look for further recompense

Than thine own gladness that thou art employed

Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile

Think not I love him though I ask for him

'Tis but a peevish boyyet he talks well

But what care I for words Yet words do well

When he that speaks them pleases those that hear

It is a pretty youthnot very pretty

But sure he's proudand yet his pride becomes him

He'll make a proper man The best thing in him

Is his complexion and faster than his tongue

Did make offense his eye did heal it up

He is not very tallyet for his years he's tall

His leg is but so-soand yet 'tis well

There was a pretty redness in his lip

A little riper and more lusty red

Than that mixed in his cheek 'twas just the difference

Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask

There be some women Silvius had they marked him

In parcels as I did would have gone near

To fall in love with him but for my part

I love him not nor hate him not and yet

I have more cause to hate him than to love him

For what had he to do to chide at me

He said mine eyes were black and my hair black

And now I am remembered scorned at me

I marvel why I answered not again

But that's all one omittance is no quittance

I'll write to him a very taunting letter

And thou shalt bear it Wilt thou Silvius

I'll write it straight

The matter's in my head and in my heart

I will be bitter with him and passing short

Go with me Silvius

Youth you have done me much ungentleness

To show the letter that I writ to you

Good shepherd tell this youth what 'tis to love

And I for Ganymede

And I for Ganymede

And so am I for Ganymede

If this be so why blame you me to love you

Nor I

That will I should I die the hour after

So is the bargain

If sight and shape be true

Why then my love adieu

I will not eat my word Now thou art mine

Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine
