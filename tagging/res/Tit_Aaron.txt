


Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top

Safe out of Fortune's shot and sits aloft

Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash

Advanced above pale Envy's threat'ning reach

As when the golden sun salutes the morn

And having gilt the ocean with his beams

Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach

And overlooks the highest-peering hills

So Tamora

Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait

And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown

Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts

To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress

And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long

Hast prisoner held fettered in amorous chains

And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes

Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus

Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts

I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold

To wait upon this new-made emperess

To wait said I To wanton with this queen

This goddess this Semiramis this nymph

This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine

And see his shipwrack and his commonweal's

Holla What storm is this

Clubs clubs These lovers will not keep the peace

Why how now lords

So near the Emperor's palace dare you draw

And maintain such a quarrel openly

Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge

I would not for a million of gold

The cause were known to them it most concerns

Nor would your noble mother for much more

Be so dishonored in the court of Rome

For shame put up

Away I say

Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore

This petty brabble will undo us all

Why lords and think you not how dangerous

It is to jet upon a prince's right

What is Lavinia then become so loose

Or Bassianus so degenerate

That for her love such quarrels may be broached

Without controlment justice or revenge

Young lords beware And should the Empress know

This discord's ground the music would not please

Why are you mad Or know you not in Rome

How furious and impatient they be

And cannot brook competitors in love

I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths

By this device

To achieve her how

Ay and as good as Saturninus may

Why then it seems some certain snatch or so

Would serve your turns

Would you had hit it too

Then should not we be tired with this ado

Why hark you hark you And are you such fools

To square for this Would it offend you then

That both should speed

For shame be friends and join for that you jar

'Tis policy and stratagem must do

That you affect and so must you resolve

That what you cannot as you would achieve

You must perforce accomplish as you may

Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste

Than this Lavinia Bassianus' love

A speedier course than ling'ring languishment

Must we pursue and I have found the path

My lords a solemn hunting is in hand

There will the lovely Roman ladies troop

The forest walks are wide and spacious

And many unfrequented plots there are

Fitted by kind for rape and villainy

Single you thither then this dainty doe

And strike her home by force if not by words

This way or not at all stand you in hope

Come come our empress with her sacred wit

To villainy and vengeance consecrate

Will we acquaint withal what we intend

And she shall file our engines with advice

That will not suffer you to square yourselves

But to your wishes' height advance you both

The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame

The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears

The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull

There speak and strike brave boys and take your turns

There serve your lust shadowed from heaven's eye

And revel in Lavinia's treasury

He that had wit would think that I had none

To bury so much gold under a tree

And never after to inherit it

Let him that thinks of me so abjectly

Know that this gold must coin a stratagem

Which cunningly effected will beget

A very excellent piece of villainy

And so repose sweet gold for their unrest

That have their alms out of the Empress' chest

Madam though Venus govern your desires

Saturn is dominator over mine

What signifies my deadly standing eye

My silence and my cloudy melancholy

My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls

Even as an adder when she doth unroll

To do some fatal execution

No madam these are no venereal signs

Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand

Blood and revenge are hammering in my head

Hark Tamora the empress of my soul

Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee

This is the day of doom for Bassianus

His Philomel must lose her tongue today

Thy sons make pillage of her chastity

And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood

Seest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee

And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll

Now question me no more We are espied

Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty

Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction

No more great empress Bassianus comes

Be cross with him and I'll go fetch thy sons

To back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be

Come on my lords the better foot before

Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit

Where I espied the panther fast asleep

Now will I fetch the King to find them here

That he thereby may have a likely guess

How these were they that made away his brother

My gracious lord here is the bag of gold

Titus Andronicus my lord the Emperor

Sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons

Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus

Or any one of you chop off your hand

And send it to the King he for the same

Will send thee hither both thy sons alive

And that shall be the ransom for their fault

Nay come agree whose hand shall go along

For fear they die before their pardon come

If that be called deceit I will be honest

And never whilst I live deceive men so

But I'll deceive you in another sort

And that you'll say ere half an hour pass

I go Andronicus and for thy hand

Look by and by to have thy sons with thee

Their heads I mean O how this villainy

Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it

Let fools do good and fair men call for grace

Aaron will have his soul black like his face

Ay some mad message from his mad grandfather

Ay just a verse in Horace right you have it

Now what a thing it is to be an ass

Here's no sound jest The old man hath found their guilt

And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines

That wound beyond their feeling to the quick

But were our witty empress well afoot

She would applaud Andronicus' conceit

But let her rest in her unrest awhile

And now young lords was 't not a happy star

Led us to Rome strangers and more than so

Captives to be advancd to this height

It did me good before the palace gate

To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing

Had he not reason Lord Demetrius

Did you not use his daughter very friendly

Here lacks but your mother for to say amen

Pray to the devils the gods have given us over

Well more or less or ne'er a whit at all

Here Aaron is And what with Aaron now

Why what a caterwauling dost thou keep

What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms

To whom

Well God give her good rest What hath he sent her

Why then she is the devil's dam A joyful issue

Zounds you whore is black so base a hue

Sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure

That which thou canst not undo

Villain I have done thy mother

It shall not die

What must it nurse Then let no man but I

Do execution on my flesh and blood

Sooner this sword shall plow thy bowels up

Stay murderous villains will you kill your brother

Now by the burning tapers of the sky

That shone so brightly when this boy was got

He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point

That touches this my firstborn son and heir

I tell you younglings not Enceladus

With all his threat'ning band of Typhon's brood

Nor great Alcides nor the god of war

Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands

What what you sanguine shallow-hearted boys

You white-limed walls you alehouse painted signs

Coal-black is better than another hue

In that it scorns to bear another hue

For all the water in the ocean

Can never turn the swan's black legs to white

Although she lave them hourly in the flood

Tell the Empress from me I am of age

To keep mine own excuse it how she can

My mistress is my mistress this myself

The vigor and the picture of my youth

This before all the world do I prefer

This maugre all the world will I keep safe

Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome

Why there's the privilege your beauty bears

Fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing

The close enacts and counsels of thy heart

Here's a young lad framed of another leer

Look how the black slave smiles upon the father

As who should say Old lad I am thine own

He is your brother lords sensibly fed

Of that self blood that first gave life to you

And from that womb where you imprisoned were

He is enfranchisd and come to light

Nay he is your brother by the surer side

Although my seal be stampd in his face

Then sit we down and let us all consult

My son and I will have the wind of you

Keep there Now talk at pleasure of your safety

Why so brave lords When we join in league

I am a lamb but if you brave the Moor

The chafd boar the mountain lioness

The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms

But say again how many saw the child

The Empress the midwife and yourself

Two may keep counsel when the third's away

Go to the Empress tell her this I said

Wheak wheak So cries a pig prepard to the spit

O Lord sir 'tis a deed of policy

Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours

A long-tongued babbling gossip No lords no

And now be it known to you my full intent

Not far one Muliteus my countryman

His wife but yesternight was brought to bed

His child is like to her fair as you are

Go pack with him and give the mother gold

And tell them both the circumstance of all

And how by this their child shall be advanced

And be receivd for the Emperor's heir

And substituted in the place of mine

To calm this tempest whirling in the court

And let the Emperor dandle him for his own

Hark you lords you see I have given her physic

And you must needs bestow her funeral

The fields are near and you are gallant grooms

This done see that you take no longer days

But send the midwife presently to me

The midwife and the nurse well made away

Then let the ladies tattle what they please

Now to the Goths as swift as swallow flies

There to dispose this treasure in mine arms

And secretly to greet the Empress' friends

Come on you thick-lipped slave I'll bear you hence

For it is you that puts us to our shifts

I'll make you feed on berries and on roots

And feed on curds and whey and suck the goat

And cabin in a cave and bring you up

To be a warrior and command a camp

Touch not the boy He is of royal blood

Lucius save the child

And bear it from me to the Empress

If thou do this I'll show thee wondrous things

That highly may advantage thee to hear

If thou wilt not befall what may befall

I'll speak no more but Vengeance rot you all

And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius

'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak

For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres

Acts of black night abominable deeds

Complots of mischief treason villainies

Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed

And this shall all be buried in my death

Unless thou swear to me my child shall live

Swear that he shall and then I will begin

What if I do not As indeed I do not

Yet for I know thou art religious

And hast a thing within thee calld conscience

With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies

Which I have seen thee careful to observe

Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know

An idiot holds his bauble for a god

And keeps the oath which by that god he swears

To that I'll urge him Therefore thou shalt vow

By that same god what god soe'er it be

That thou adorest and hast in reverence

To save my boy to nourish and bring him up

Or else I will discover naught to thee

First know thou I begot him on the Empress

Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity

To that which thou shalt hear of me anon

'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus

They cut thy sister's tongue and ravished her

And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest

Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and 'twas

Trim sport for them which had the doing of it

Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them

That codding spirit had they from their mother

As sure a card as ever won the set

That bloody mind I think they learned of me

As true a dog as ever fought at head

Well let my deeds be witness of my worth

I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole

Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay

I wrote the letter that thy father found

And hid the gold within that letter mentioned

Confederate with the Queen and her two sons

And what not done that thou hast cause to rue

Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it

I played the cheater for thy father's hand

And when I had it drew myself apart

And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter

I pried me through the crevice of a wall

When for his hand he had his two sons' heads

Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily

That both mine eyes were rainy like to his

And when I told the Empress of this sport

She sounded almost at my pleasing tale

And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses

Ay like a black dog as the saying is

Ay that I had not done a thousand more

Even now I curse the dayand yet I think

Few come within the compass of my curse

Wherein I did not some notorious ill

As kill a man or else devise his death

Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it

Accuse some innocent and forswear myself

Set deadly enmity between two friends

Make poor men's cattle break their necks

Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night

And bid the owners quench them with their tears

Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves

And set them upright at their dear friends' door

Even when their sorrows almost was forgot

And on their skins as on the bark of trees

Have with my knife carvd in Roman letters

Let not your sorrow die though I am dead

But I have done a thousand dreadful things

As willingly as one would kill a fly

And nothing grieves me heartily indeed

But that I cannot do ten thousand more

If there be devils would I were a devil

To live and burn in everlasting fire

So I might have your company in hell

But to torment you with my bitter tongue

Some devil whisper curses in my ear

And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth

The venomous malice of my swelling heart

Ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb

I am no baby I that with base prayers

I should repent the evils I have done

Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did

Would I perform if I might have my will

If one good deed in all my life I did

I do repent it from my very soul
