Nay come for if they do approach the city we

shall lose all the sight

It is reported that he has taken their great'st

commander and that with his own hand he slew

the Duke's brother We have

lost our labor They are gone a contrary way Hark

you may know by their trumpets

I have told my neighbor how you

have been solicited by a gentleman his

companion

I hope so

Look here comes a pilgrim I know she will lie at

my house thither they send one another I'll question

herGod save you pilgrim Whither are

bound

At the Saint Francis here beside the port

Ay marry is 'tHark you they come this way

If you will tarry holy pilgrim

But till the troops come by

I will conduct you where you shall be lodged

The rather for I think I know your hostess

As ample as myself

If you shall please so pilgrim

You came I think from France

Here you shall see a countryman of yours

That has done worthy service

I warrant good creature wheresoe'er she is

Her heart weighs sadly This young maid might do her

A shrewd turn if she pleased

He does indeed

And brokes with all that can in such a suit

Corrupt the tender honor of a maid

But she is armed for him and keeps her guard

In honestest defense

So now they come

That is Antonio the Duke's eldest son

That Escalus

Marry hang you

The troop is passed Come pilgrim I will bring you

Where you shall host Of enjoined penitents

There's four or five to Great Saint Jaques bound

Already at my house

We'll take your offer kindly

Though my estate be fall'n I was well born

Nothing acquainted with these businesses

And would not put my reputation now

In any staining act

I should believe you

For you have showed me that which well approves

You're great in fortune

Now I see the bottom of your purpose

I have yielded

Instruct my daughter how she shall persever

That time and place with this deceit so lawful

May prove coherent Every night he comes

With musics of all sorts and songs composed

To her unworthiness It nothing steads us

To chide him from our eaves for he persists

As if his life lay on 't

Gentle madam

You never had a servant to whose trust

Your business was more welcome

Lord how we lose our pains

I am her mother sir whose age and honor

Both suffer under this complaint we bring

And both shall cease without your remedy
