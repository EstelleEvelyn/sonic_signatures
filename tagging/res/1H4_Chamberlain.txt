Good morrow Master Gadshill It holds

current that I told you yesternight there's a franklin

in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred

marks with him in gold I heard him tell it to one of

his company last night at suppera kind of auditor

one that hath abundance of charge too God knows

what They are up already and call for eggs and

butter They will away presently

No I'll none of it I pray thee keep that

for the hangman for I know thou worshipest Saint

Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may

What the commonwealth their boots

Will she hold out water in foul way

Nay by my faith I think you are more

beholding to the night than to fern seed for your

walking invisible

Nay rather let me have it as you are a

false thief
