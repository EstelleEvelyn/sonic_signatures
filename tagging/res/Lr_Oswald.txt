


Ay, madam.

He’s coming, madam. I hear him.

Well, madam.

So please you—

My lady’s father.

I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your

pardon.

I’ll not be strucken, my lord.

Ay, madam.

Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this

house?

Where may we set our horses?

Prithee, if thou lov’st me, tell me.

Why then, I care not for thee.

Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.

What dost thou know me for?

Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou thus

to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor

knows thee!

Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

Help, ho! Murder! Help!

Help, ho! Murder, murder!

I am scarce in breath, my lord.

This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have

spared at suit of his gray beard—

I never gave him any.

It pleased the King his master very late

To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;

When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,

Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,

And put upon him such a deal of man

That worthied him, got praises of the King

For him attempting who was self-subdued;

And in the fleshment of this dread exploit,

Drew on me here again.

My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.

Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights,

Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,

Who, with some other of the lord’s dependents,

Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast

To have well-armèd friends.

Madam, within, but never man so changed.

I told him of the army that was landed;

He smiled at it. I told him you were coming;

His answer was “The worse.” Of Gloucester’s treachery

And of the loyal service of his son

When I informed him, then he called me “sot”

And told me I had turned the wrong side out.

What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;

What like, offensive.

Madam, here comes my lord.

Ay, madam.

Madam, with much ado.

Your sister is the better soldier.

No, madam.

I know not, lady.

I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

I may not, madam.

My lady charged my duty in this business.

Madam, I had rather—

I, madam?

Would I could meet him, madam. I should show

What party I do follow.

 A proclaimed prize! Most happy!

That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh

To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,

Briefly thyself remember; the sword is out

That must destroy thee.

Wherefore, bold peasant,

Dar’st thou support a published traitor? Hence,

Lest that th’ infection of his fortune take

Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.

Let go, slave, or thou diest!

Out, dunghill.

Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.

If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,

And give the letters which thou find’st about me

To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out

Upon the English party. O, untimely death! Death!
