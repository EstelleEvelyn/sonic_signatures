


You have her father's love Demetrius

Let me have Hermia's Do you marry him

I am my lord as well derived as he

As well possessed My love is more than his

My fortunes every way as fairly ranked

If not with vantage as Demetrius'

And which is more than all these boasts can be

I am beloved of beauteous Hermia

Why should not I then prosecute my right

Demetrius I'll avouch it to his head

Made love to Nedar's daughter Helena

And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes

Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry

Upon this spotted and inconstant man

How now my love Why is your cheek so pale

How chance the roses there do fade so fast

Ay me For aught that I could ever read

Could ever hear by tale or history

The course of true love never did run smooth

But either it was different in blood

Or else misgraffd in respect of years

Or else it stood upon the choice of friends

Or if there were a sympathy in choice

War death or sickness did lay siege to it

Making it momentany as a sound

Swift as a shadow short as any dream

Brief as the lightning in the collied night

That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and Earth

And ere a man hath power to say Behold

The jaws of darkness do devour it up

So quick bright things come to confusion

A good persuasion Therefore hear me Hermia

I have a widow aunt a dowager

Of great revenue and she hath no child

From Athens is her house remote seven leagues

And she respects me as her only son

There gentle Hermia may I marry thee

And to that place the sharp Athenian law

Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then

Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night

And in the wood a league without the town

Where I did meet thee once with Helena

To do observance to a morn of May

There will I stay for thee

Keep promise love Look here comes Helena

Helen to you our minds we will unfold

Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold

Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass

Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass

A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal

Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal

I will my Hermia Helena adieu

As you on him Demetrius dote on you

Fair love you faint with wand'ring in the wood

And to speak troth I have forgot our way

We'll rest us Hermia if you think it good

And tarry for the comfort of the day

One turf shall serve as pillow for us both

One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth

O take the sense sweet of my innocence

Love takes the meaning in love's conference

I mean that my heart unto yours is knit

So that but one heart we can make of it

Two bosoms interchaind with an oath

So then two bosoms and a single troth

Then by your side no bed-room me deny

For lying so Hermia I do not lie

Amen amen to that fair prayer say I

And then end life when I end loyalty

Here is my bed Sleep give thee all his rest

And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake

Transparent Helena Nature shows art

That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart

Where is Demetrius O how fit a word

Is that vile name to perish on my sword

Content with Hermia No I do repent

The tedious minutes I with her have spent

Not Hermia but Helena I love

Who will not change a raven for a dove

The will of man is by his reason swayed

And reason says you are the worthier maid

Things growing are not ripe until their season

So I being young till now ripe not to reason

And touching now the point of human skill

Reason becomes the marshal to my will

And leads me to your eyes where I o'erlook

Love's stories written in love's richest book

She sees not HermiaHermia sleep thou there

And never mayst thou come Lysander near

For as a surfeit of the sweetest things

The deepest loathing to the stomach brings

Or as the heresies that men do leave

Are hated most of those they did deceive

So thou my surfeit and my heresy

Of all be hated but the most of me

And all my powers address your love and might

To honor Helen and to be her knight

Why should you think that I should woo in scorn

Scorn and derision never come in tears

Look when I vow I weep and vows so born

In their nativity all truth appears

How can these things in me seem scorn to you

Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true

I had no judgment when to her I swore

Demetrius loves her and he loves not you

You are unkind Demetrius Be not so

For you love Hermia this you know I know

And here with all goodwill with all my heart

In Hermia's love I yield you up my part

And yours of Helena to me bequeath

Whom I do love and will do till my death

Helen it is not so

Why should he stay whom love doth press to go

Lysander's love that would not let him bide

Fair Helena who more engilds the night

Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light

Why seek'st thou me Could not this make thee know

The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so

Stay gentle Helena Hear my excuse

My love my life my soul fair Helena

Thou canst compel no more than she entreat

Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers

Helen I love thee By my life I do

I swear by that which I will lose for thee

To prove him false that says I love thee not

If thou say so withdraw and prove it too

Away you Ethiop

Hang off thou cat thou burr Vile thing let loose

Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent

Thy love Out tawny Tartar out

Out loathd med'cine O hated potion hence

Demetrius I will keep my word with thee

What Should I hurt her strike her kill her dead

Although I hate her I'll not harm her so

Ay by my life

And never did desire to see thee more

Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt

Be certain nothing truer 'tis no jest

That I do hate thee and love Helena

Be not afraid She shall not harm thee Helena

Get you gone you dwarf

You minimus of hind'ring knotgrass made

You bead you acorn

Now she holds me not

Now follow if thou dar'st to try whose right

Of thine or mine is most in Helena

Where art thou proud Demetrius Speak thou now

I will be with thee straight

He goes before me and still dares me on

When I come where he calls then he is gone

The villain is much lighter-heeled than I

I followed fast but faster he did fly

That fallen am I in dark uneven way

And here will rest me Come thou gentle day

For if but once thou show me thy gray light

I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite

Pardon my lord

My lord I shall reply amazdly

Half sleep half waking But as yet I swear

I cannot truly say how I came here

But as I thinkfor truly would I speak

And now I do bethink me so it is

I came with Hermia hither Our intent

Was to be gone from Athens where we might

Without the peril of the Athenian law

And he did bid us follow to the temple

More than to us

Wait in your royal walks your board your bed

He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt

he knows not the stop A good moral my lord it is

not enough to speak but to speak true

This lion is a very fox for his valor

Proceed Moon

And so the lion vanished

Less than an ace man for he is dead he is

nothing

She hath spied him already with those

sweet eyes
