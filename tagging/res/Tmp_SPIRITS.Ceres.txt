


Hail many-colored messenger that ne'er

Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter

Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers

Diffusest honey drops refreshing showers

And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown

My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down

Rich scarf to my proud Earth Why hath thy queen

Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green

Tell me heavenly bow

If Venus or her son as thou dost know

Do now attend the Queen Since they did plot

The means that dusky Dis my daughter got

Her and her blind boy's scandaled company

I have forsworn

Highest queen of state

Great Juno comes I know her by her gait

Earth's increase foison plenty

Barns and garners never empty

Vines with clust'ring bunches growing

Plants with goodly burden bowing

Spring come to you at the farthest

In the very end of harvest

Scarcity and want shall shun you

Ceres' blessing so is on you
