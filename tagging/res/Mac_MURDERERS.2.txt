I am one my liege

Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world

Hath so incensed that I am reckless what

I do to spite the world

True my lord

We shall my lord

Perform what you command us

We are resolved my lord

He needs not our mistrust since he delivers

Our offices and what we have to do

To the direction just

Then 'tis he The rest

That are within the note of expectation

A light a light

We have lost best half of our

affair
