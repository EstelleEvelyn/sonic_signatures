Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues

Be theme and hearing ever was in this Britain

And conquered it Cassibelan thine uncle

Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less

Than in his feats deserving it for him

And his succession granted Rome a tribute

Yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately

Is left untendered

I am sorry Cymbeline

That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar

Caesar that hath more kings his servants than

Thyself domestic officersthine enemy

Receive it from me then war and confusion

In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee Look

For fury not to be resisted Thus defied

I thank thee for myself

Let proof speak

So sir

Thanks royal sir

My emperor hath wrote I must from hence

And am right sorry that I must report you

My master's enemy

So sir I desire of you

A conduct overland to Milford Haven

Madam all joy befall your Graceand you

Your hand my lord

Sir the event

Is yet to name the winner Fare you well

But what from Rome

When expect you them

This forwardness

Makes our hopes fair Command our present numbers

Be mustered bid the Captains look to 'tNow sir

What have you dreamed of late of this war's purpose

Dream often so

And never falseSoft ho what trunk is here

Without his top The ruin speaks that sometime

It was a worthy building How a page

Or dead or sleeping on him But dead rather

For nature doth abhor to make his bed

With the defunct or sleep upon the dead

Let's see the boy's face

He'll then instruct us of this bodyYoung one

Inform us of thy fortunes for it seems

They crave to be demanded Who is this

Thou mak'st thy bloody pillow Or who was he

That otherwise than noble nature did

Hath altered that good picture What's thy interest

In this sad wrack How came 't Who is 't

What art thou

'Lack good youth

Thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than

Thy master in bleeding Say his name good friend

Thy name

Thou dost approve thyself the very same

Thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name

Wilt take thy chance with me I will not say

Thou shalt be so well mastered but be sure

No less beloved The Roman Emperor's letters

Sent by a consul to me should not sooner

Than thine own worth prefer thee Go with me

Ay good youth

And rather father thee than master theeMy friends

The boy hath taught us manly duties Let us

Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can

And make him with our pikes and partisans

A grave Come arm himBoy he's preferred

By thee to us and he shall be interred

As soldiers can Be cheerful wipe thine eyes

Some falls are means the happier to arise

Away boy from the troops and save thyself

For friends kill friends and the disorder's such

As war were hoodwinked

It is a day turned strangely Or betimes

Let's reinforce or fly

Consider sir the chance of war The day

Was yours by accident Had it gone with us

We should not when the blood was cool have threatened

Our prisoners with the sword But since the gods

Will have it thus that nothing but our lives

May be called ransom let it come Sufficeth

A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer

Augustus lives to think on 't and so much

For my peculiar care This one thing only

I will entreat my boy a Briton born

Let him be ransomed Never master had

A page so kind so duteous diligent

So tender over his occasions true

So feat so nurselike Let his virtue join

With my request which I'll make bold your Highness

Cannot deny He hath done no Briton harm

Though he have served a Roman Save him sir

And spare no blood beside

I do not bid thee beg my life good lad

And yet I know thou wilt

The boy disdains me

He leaves me scorns me Briefly die their joys

That place them on the truth of girls and boys

Why stands he so perplexed

Happy be you
