


Before we proceed any further hear me

speak

Speak speak

You are all resolved rather to die than to

famish

Resolved resolved

First you know Caius Martius is chief

enemy to the people

We know 't we know 't

Let us kill him and we'll have corn at

our own price Is 't a verdict

No more talking on 't let it be done Away away

We are accounted poor citizens the patricians

good What authority surfeits on would

relieve us If they would yield us but the superfluity

while it were wholesome we might guess they

relieved us humanely But they think we are too

dear The leanness that afflicts us the object of our

misery is as an inventory to particularize their

abundance our sufferance is a gain to them Let

us revenge this with our pikes ere we become

rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for

bread not in thirst for revenge

Against him first He's a very dog to the

commonalty

Very well and could be content to give

him good report for 't but that he pays himself

with being proud

I say unto you what he hath done

famously he did it to that end Though soft-conscienced

men can be content to say it was for

his country he did it to please his mother and to be

partly proud which he is even to the altitude of

his virtue

If I must not I need not be barren of accusations

He hath faults with surplus to tire in

repetition What shouts are these

The other side o' th' city is risen Why stay we prating

here To th' Capitol

Come come

Soft who comes here

He's one honest enough Would all the

rest were so

Down with him down with him

Let's hear our tribune Peace Speak speak speak

True

The people are the city

You so remain

Yield Martius yield

Down with him down with him

He shall well know

The noble tribunes are the people's mouths

And we their hands

He shall sure on 't

No no no no no

To th' rock to th' rock with him

It shall be so it shall be so Let him away

He's banished and it shall be so

It shall be so it shall be so

Our enemy is banished he is gone Hoo hoo

Come come let's see him out at gates Come

The gods preserve our noble tribunes Come

The gods preserve you both

Ourselves our wives and children on our knees

Are bound to pray for you both

Now the gods keep you

Faith we hear fearful news

For mine own part

When I said banish him I said 'twas pity

The gods be good to us Come masters

let's home I ever said we were i' th' wrong when

we banished him
