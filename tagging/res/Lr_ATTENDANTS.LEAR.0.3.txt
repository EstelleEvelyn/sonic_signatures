Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner,

My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to

I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be

mistaken, for my duty cannot be silent when I think

your Highness wronged.

Since my young lady’s going into France, sir,

the Fool hath much pined away.
