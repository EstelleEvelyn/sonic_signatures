lord did but try us this other day.

It should not be, by the persuasion of

his new feasting.

In like manner was I in debt to my

importunate business, but he would not hear my

excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me,

that my provision was out.

Every man here’s so. What would he

have borrowed of you?

A thousand pieces!

He sent to me, sir—

Here he comes.

The swallow follows not summer

more willing than we your Lordship.

My noble lord—

My most honorable lord, I am e’en

sick of shame that when your Lordship this other

day sent to me, I was so unfortunate a beggar.

If you had sent but two hours before—

All covered dishes!

Alcibiades banished?

I pray you, upon what?

This is the old man still.

It does, but time will—and so—

Know you the quality of Lord Timon’s

fury?

Did you see my cap?

Lord Timon’s mad.
