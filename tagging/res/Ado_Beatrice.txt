


I pray you is Signior Mountanto returned

from the wars or no

He set up his bills here in Messina and

challenged Cupid at the flight and my uncle's Fool

reading the challenge subscribed for Cupid and

challenged him at the bird-bolt I pray you how

many hath he killed and eaten in these wars But

how many hath he killed For indeed I promised to

eat all of his killing

You had musty victual and he hath holp to

eat it He is a very valiant trencherman he hath an

excellent stomach

And a good soldier to a lady but what is he

to a lord

It is so indeed He is no less than a stuffed

man but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal

Alas he gets nothing by that In our last

conflict four of his five wits went halting off and

now is the whole man governed with one so that if

he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him

bear it for a difference between himself and his

horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to

be known a reasonable creature Who is his companion

now He hath every month a new sworn

brother

Very easily possible He wears his faith but

as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the

next block

No An he were I would burn my study But

I pray you who is his companion Is there no

young squarer now that will make a voyage with

him to the devil

O Lord he will hang upon him like a

disease He is sooner caught than the pestilence

and the taker runs presently mad God help the

noble Claudio If he have caught the Benedick it

will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured

Do good friend

No not till a hot January

I wonder that you will still be talking Signior

Benedick nobody marks you

Is it possible disdain should die while she

hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick

Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come

in her presence

A dear happiness to women They would

else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor I

thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor

for that I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow

than a man swear he loves me

Scratching could not make it worse an

'twere such a face as yours were

A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of

yours

You always end with a jade's trick I know

you of old

How tartly that gentleman looks I never

can see him but I am heartburned an hour after

He were an excellent man that were made

just in the midway between him and Benedick The

one is too like an image and says nothing and the

other too like my lady's eldest son evermore

tattling

With a good leg and a good foot uncle and

money enough in his purse such a man would win

any woman in the world if he could get her

goodwill

Too curst is more than curst I shall lessen

God's sending that way for it is said God sends a

curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he

sends none

Just if He send me no husband for the

which blessing I am at Him upon my knees every

morning and evening Lord I could not endure a

husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in

the woolen

What should I do with him Dress him in my

apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman

He that hath a beard is more than a youth and he

that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is

more than a youth is not for me and he that is less

than a man I am not for him Therefore I will even

take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd and lead

his apes into hell

No but to the gate and there will the devil

meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his

head and say Get you to heaven Beatrice get you

to heaven here's no place for you maids So deliver

I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the

heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and

there live we as merry as the day is long

Yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make

curtsy and say Father as it please you But yet for

all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or

else make another curtsy and say Father as it

please me

Not till God make men of some other metal

than earth Would it not grieve a woman to be

overmastered with a piece of valiant dust To make

an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl

No uncle I'll none Adam's sons are my brethren

and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred

The fault will be in the music cousin if you

be not wooed in good time If the Prince be too

important tell him there is measure in everything

and so dance out the answer For hear me Hero

wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a

measure and a cinquepace The first suit is hot and

hasty like a Scotch jig and full as fantastical the

wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of

state and ancientry and then comes repentance

and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster

and faster till he sink into his grave

I have a good eye uncle I can see a church

by daylight

Will you not tell me who told you so

Nor will you not tell me who you are

That I was disdainful and that I had my

good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales Well this

was Signior Benedick that said so

I am sure you know him well enough

Did he never make you laugh

Why he is the Prince's jester a very dull

fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders

None but libertines delight in him and the commendation

is not in his wit but in his villainy for he

both pleases men and angers them and then they

laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the

fleetI would he had boarded me

Do do He'll but break a comparison or two

on me which peradventure not marked or not

laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then

there's a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat

no supper that night We must

follow the leaders

Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them

at the next turning

Indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and I

gave him use for it a double heart for his single

one Marry once before he won it of me with false

dice Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost

it

So I would not he should do me my lord

lest I should prove the mother of fools I have

brought Count Claudio whom you sent me to seek

The Count is neither sad nor sick nor merry

nor well but civil count civil as an orange and

something of that jealous complexion

Speak count 'tis your cue

Speak cousin or if you cannot stop his

mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither

Yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on

the windy side of care My cousin tells him in his ear

that he is in her heart

Good Lord for alliance Thus goes everyone

to the world but I and I am sunburnt I may sit in a

corner and cry Heigh-ho for a husband

I would rather have one of your father's

getting Hath your Grace ne'er a brother like you

Your father got excellent husbands if a maid could

come by them

No my lord unless I might have another for

working days Your Grace is too costly to wear

every day But I beseech your Grace pardon me I

was born to speak all mirth and no matter

No sure my lord my mother cried but then

there was a star danced and under that was I

bornCousins God give you joy

I cry you mercy uncleBy your Grace's

pardon

Against my will I am sent to bid you come

in to dinner

I took no more pains for those thanks than

you take pains to thank me If it had been painful I

would not have come

Yea just so much as you may take upon a

knife's point and choke a daw withal You have no

stomach signior Fare you well

What fire is in mine ears Can this be true

Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much

Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu

No glory lives behind the back of such

And Benedick love on I will requite thee

Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand

If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee

To bind our loves up in a holy band

For others say thou dost deserve and I

Believe it better than reportingly

Good morrow sweet Hero

I am out of all other tune methinks

You light o' love with your heels Then if

your husband have stables enough you'll see he

shall lack no barns

'Tis almost five o'clock cousin 'Tis time

you were ready By my troth I am exceeding ill

Heigh-ho

For the letter that begins them all H

What means the fool trow

I am stuffed cousin I cannot smell

O God help me God help me How long

have you professed apprehension

It is not seen enough you should wear it in

your cap By my troth I am sick

Benedictus Why benedictus You have some

moral in this benedictus

What pace is this that thy tongue keeps

Why how now cousin wherefore sink you down

Dead I thinkHelp uncle

Hero why Hero Uncle Signior Benedick Friar

How now cousin Hero

O on my soul my cousin is belied

No truly not although until last night

I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow

Yea and I will weep a while longer

You have no reason I do it freely

Ah how much might the man deserve of me

that would right her

A very even way but no such friend

It is a man's office but not yours

As strange as the thing I know not It were as

possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you

but believe me not and yet I lie not I confess

nothing nor I deny nothing I am sorry for my

cousin

Do not swear and eat it

Will you not eat your word

Why then God forgive me

You have stayed me in a happy hour I was

about to protest I loved you

I love you with so much of my heart that

none is left to protest

Kill Claudio

You kill me to deny it Farewell

I am gone though I am here There is no

love in you Nay I pray you let me go

In faith I will go

You dare easier be friends with me than

fight with mine enemy

Is he not approved in the height a villain

that hath slandered scorned dishonored my kinswoman

O that I were a man What bear her in

hand until they come to take hands and then with

public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated

rancorO God that I were a man I would eat his

heart in the marketplace

Talk with a man out at a window A proper

saying

Sweet Hero she is wronged she is slandered

she is undone

Princes and counties Surely a princely testimony

a goodly count Count Comfect a sweet

gallant surely O that I were a man for his sake Or

that I had any friend would be a man for my sake

But manhood is melted into curtsies valor into

compliment and men are only turned into tongue

and trim ones too He is now as valiant as Hercules

that only tells a lie and swears it I cannot be a man

with wishing therefore I will die a woman with

grieving

Use it for my love some other way than

swearing by it

Yea as sure as I have a thought or a soul

Yea signior and depart when you bid me

Then is spoken Fare you well now And

yet ere I go let me go with that I came which is

with knowing what hath passed between you and

Claudio

Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is

but foul breath and foul breath is noisome Therefore

I will depart unkissed

For them all together which maintained so

politic a state of evil that they will not admit any

good part to intermingle with them But for which

of my good parts did you first suffer love for me

In spite of your heart I think Alas poor

heart if you spite it for my sake I will spite it for

yours for I will never love that which my friend

hates

It appears not in this confession There's not

one wise man among twenty that will praise

himself

And how long is that think you

Very ill

Very ill too

Will you go hear this news signior

I answer to that name What is your will

Why no no more than reason

Do not you love me

Why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula

Are much deceived for they did swear you did

They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me

No truly but in friendly recompense

I would not deny you but by this good day I

yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your

life for I was told you were in a consumption
