thus out of measure sad?

You should hear reason.

If not a present remedy, at least a patient

sufferance.

Yea, but you must not make the full show of

this till you may do it without controlment. You

have of late stood out against your brother, and he

hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is

impossible you should take true root but by the fair

weather that you make yourself. It is needful that

you frame the season for your own harvest.

Can you make no use of your discontent?

To the death, my lord.

Here, man, I am at thy elbow.

I will owe thee an answer for that. And now

forward with thy tale.

Is it possible that any villainy should be so

dear?

I wonder at it.

Yes, it is apparel.

Yes, the fashion is the fashion.

No, ’twas the vane on the house.

All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears

out more apparel than the man. But art not thou

thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast

shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the

fashion?

And thought they Margaret was Hero?

A commodity in question, I warrant you.—

Come, we’ll obey you.

I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is

Conrade.

Yea, sir, we hope.

Marry, sir, we say we are none.

Off, coxcomb!

Away! You are an ass, you are an ass!
