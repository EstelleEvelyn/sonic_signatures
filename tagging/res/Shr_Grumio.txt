


Knock sir Whom should I knock Is there

any man has rebused your Worship

Knock you here sir Why sir what am I sir

that I should knock you here sir

My master is grown quarrelsome I should knock you first

And then I know after who comes by the worst

Help mistress help My master is mad

Nay 'tis no matter sir what he 'leges in

Latin If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave

his servicelook you sir he bid me knock him

and rap him soundly sir Well was it fit for a

servant to use his master so being perhaps for

aught I see two-and-thirty a pip out

Whom would to God I had well knocked at first

Then had not Grumio come by the worst

Knock at the gate O heavens spake you not

these words plain Sirrah knock me here rap me

here knock me well and knock me soundly And

come you now with knocking at the gate

Nay look you sir he tells you

flatly what his mind is Why give him gold enough

and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby or an

old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head though she

have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses Why

nothing comes amiss so money comes withal

I pray you sir let him go while

the humor lasts O' my word an she knew him as

well as I do she would think scolding would do little

good upon him She may perhaps call him half a

score knaves or so Why that's nothing an he begin

once he'll rail in his rope tricks I'll tell you what

sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a

figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that

she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat

You know him not sir

Katherine the curst

A title for a maid of all titles the worst

Here's no knavery See to beguile the old

folks how the young folks lay their heads together

Master master look about you Who goes there ha

A proper stripling and an amorous

O this woodcock what an ass it is

And that his bags shall prove

Will he woo her Ay or I'll hang her

For he fears none

I would I were as sure of a good dinner

O excellent motion Fellows let's be gone

Ay sir they be ready the oats have eaten the

horses

Fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters

and all foul ways Was ever man so beaten Was

ever man so 'rayed Was ever man so weary I am

sent before to make a fire and they are coming

after to warm them Now were not I a little pot and

soon hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my

tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my

belly ere I should come by a fire to thaw me But I

with blowing the fire shall warm myself For considering

the weather a taller man than I will take

coldHolla ho Curtis

A piece of ice If thou doubt it thou mayst

slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater

a run but my head and my neck A fire good Curtis

Oh ay Curtis ay and therefore fire fire Cast

on no water

She was good Curtis before this frost But

thou know'st winter tames man woman and

beast for it hath tamed my old master and my new

mistress and myself fellow Curtis

Am I but three inches Why thy horn is a

foot and so long am I at the least But wilt thou

make a fire Or shall I complain on thee to our

mistress whose hand she being now at hand thou

shalt soon feel to thy cold comfort for being slow in

thy hot office

A cold world Curtis in every office but thine

and therefore fire Do thy duty and have thy duty

for my master and mistress are almost frozen to

death

Why Jack boy ho boy and as much news

as wilt thou

Why therefore fire for I have caught extreme

cold Where's the cook Is supper ready the house

trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept the servingmen

in their new fustian their white stockings

and every officer his wedding garment on Be

the Jacks fair within the Jills fair without the

carpets laid and everything in order

First know my horse is tired my master and

mistress fallen out

Out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby

hangs a tale

Lend thine ear

There

And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale And

this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech

list'ning Now I begin Imprimis we came down a

foul hill my master riding behind my mistress

What's that to thee

Tell thou the tale But hadst thou not crossed

me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell

and she under her horse thou shouldst have heard

in how miry a place how she was bemoiled how he

left her with the horse upon her how he beat me

because her horse stumbled how she waded

through the dirt to pluck him off me how he swore

how she prayed that never prayed before how I

cried how the horses ran away how her bridle was

burst how I lost my crupper with many things of

worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion

and thou return unexperienced to thy grave

Ay and that thou and the proudest of you all

shall find when he comes home But what talk I of

this Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Phillip

Walter Sugarsop and the rest Let their heads

be slickly combed their blue coats brushed and

their garters of an indifferent knit Let them curtsy

with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair

of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their hands

Are they all ready

Call them forth

Why she hath a face of her own

Thou it seems that calls for company to

countenance her

Why she comes to borrow nothing of them

Welcome youHow now youWhat

youFellow youAnd thus much for greeting

Now my spruce companions is all ready and all

things neat

E'en at hand alighted by this And therefore

be notCock's passion silence I hear my master

Here sir as foolish as I was before

Nathaniel's coat sir was not fully made

And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel

There was no link to color Peter's hat

And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing

There were none fine but Adam Rafe and Gregory

The rest were ragged old and beggarly

Yet as they are here are they come to meet you

Where is he

No no forsooth I dare not for my life

What say you to a neat's foot

I fear it is too choleric a meat

How say you to a fat tripe finely broiled

I cannot tell I fear 'tis choleric

What say you to a piece of beef and mustard

Ay but the mustard is too hot a little

Nay then I will not You shall have the mustard

Or else you get no beef of Grumio

Why then the mustard without the beef

I gave him no order I gave him the stuff

Marry sir with needle and thread

Thou hast faced many things

Face not me Thou hast braved many men

brave not me I will neither be faced nor braved I

say unto thee I bid thy master cut out the gown

but I did not bid him cut it to pieces Ergo thou

liest

The note lies in 's throat if he say I said so

Master if ever I said loose-bodied gown

sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with

a bottom of brown thread I said a gown

I confess the cape

I confess two sleeves

Error i' th' bill sir error i' th' bill I commanded

the sleeves should be cut out and sewed

up again and that I'll prove upon thee though thy

little finger be armed in a thimble

I am for thee straight Take thou the bill give

me thy mete-yard and spare not me

You are i' th' right sir 'tis for my mistress

Villain not for thy life Take up my mistress'

gown for thy master's use

O sir the conceit is deeper than you think

for Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use

O fie fie fie
