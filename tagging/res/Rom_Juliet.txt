


How now who calls

Madam I am here What is your will

And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I

It is an honor that I dream not of

I'll look to like if looking liking move

But no more deep will I endart mine eye

Than your consent gives strength to make it fly

Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much

Which mannerly devotion shows in this

For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch

And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss

Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer

Saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake

Then have my lips the sin that they have took

You kiss by th' book

Come hither nurse What is yond gentleman

What's he that now is going out of door

What's he that follows here that would not dance

Go ask his name If he be marrid

My grave is like to be my wedding bed

My only love sprung from my only hate

Too early seen unknown and known too late

Prodigious birth of love it is to me

That I must love a loathd enemy

A rhyme I learned even now

Of one I danced withal

Ay me

O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo

Deny thy father and refuse thy name

Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love

And I'll no longer be a Capulet

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy

Thou art thyself though not a Montague

What's Montague It is nor hand nor foot

Nor arm nor face O be some other name

Belonging to a man

What's in a name That which we call a rose

By any other word would smell as sweet

So Romeo would were he not Romeo called

Retain that dear perfection which he owes

Without that title Romeo doff thy name

And for thy name which is no part of thee

Take all myself

What man art thou that thus bescreened in night

So stumblest on my counsel

My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words

Of thy tongue's uttering yet I know the sound

Art thou not Romeo and a Montague

How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore

The orchard walls are high and hard to climb

And the place death considering who thou art

If any of my kinsmen find thee here

If they do see thee they will murder thee

I would not for the world they saw thee here

By whose direction found'st thou out this place

Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face

Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek

For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight

Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny

What I have spoke But farewell compliment

Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay

And I will take thy word Yet if thou swear'st

Thou mayst prove false At lovers' perjuries

They say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo

If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully

Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won

I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay

So thou wilt woo but else not for the world

In truth fair Montague I am too fond

And therefore thou mayst think my havior light

But trust me gentleman I'll prove more true

Than those that have more coying to be strange

I should have been more strange I must confess

But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware

My true-love passion Therefore pardon me

And not impute this yielding to light love

Which the dark night hath so discoverd

O swear not by the moon th' inconstant moon

That monthly changes in her circled orb

Lest that thy love prove likewise variable

Do not swear at all

Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self

Which is the god of my idolatry

And I'll believe thee

Well do not swear Although I joy in thee

I have no joy of this contract tonight

It is too rash too unadvised too sudden

Too like the lightning which doth cease to be

Ere one can say It lightens Sweet good night

This bud of love by summer's ripening breath

May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet

Good night good night As sweet repose and rest

Come to thy heart as that within my breast

What satisfaction canst thou have tonight

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it

And yet I would it were to give again

But to be frank and give it thee again

And yet I wish but for the thing I have

My bounty is as boundless as the sea

My love as deep The more I give to thee

The more I have for both are infinite

I hear some noise within Dear love adieu

Anon good nurseSweet Montague be true

Stay but a little I will come again

Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed

If that thy bent of love be honorable

Thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow

By one that I'll procure to come to thee

Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite

And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay

And follow thee my lord throughout the world

I come anonBut if thou meanest not well

I do beseech thee

By and by I come

To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief

Tomorrow will I send

A thousand times good night

Hist Romeo hist O for a falc'ner's voice

To lure this tassel-gentle back again

Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud

Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies

And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine

With repetition of My Romeo

Romeo

What o'clock tomorrow

Shall I send to thee

I will not fail 'Tis twenty year till then

I have forgot why I did call thee back

I shall forget to have thee still stand there

Rememb'ring how I love thy company

'Tis almost morning I would have thee gone

And yet no farther than a wanton's bird

That lets it hop a little from his hand

Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves

And with a silken thread plucks it back again

So loving-jealous of his liberty

Sweet so would I

Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing

Good night good night Parting is such sweet sorrow

That I shall say Good night till it be morrow

The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse

In half an hour she promised to return

Perchance she cannot meet him That's not so

O she is lame Love's heralds should be thoughts

Which ten times faster glides than the sun's beams

Driving back shadows over louring hills

Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love

And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings

Now is the sun upon the highmost hill

Of this day's journey and from nine till twelve

Is three long hours yet she is not come

Had she affections and warm youthful blood

She would be as swift in motion as a ball

My words would bandy her to my sweet love

And his to me

But old folks many feign as they were dead

Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead

O God she comesO honey nurse what news

Hast thou met with him Send thy man away

Now good sweet nurseO Lord why lookest thou sad

Though news be sad yet tell them merrily

If good thou shamest the music of sweet news

By playing it to me with so sour a face

I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news

Nay come I pray thee speak Good good nurse speak

How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath

To say to me that thou art out of breath

The excuse that thou dost make in this delay

Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse

Is thy news good or bad Answer to that

Say either and I'll stay the circumstance

Let me be satisfied is 't good or bad

No no But all this did I know before

What says he of our marriage What of that

I' faith I am sorry that thou art not well

Sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love

Where is my mother Why she is within

Where should she be How oddly thou repliest

Your love says like an honest gentleman

Where is your mother

Here's such a coil Come what says Romeo

I have

Hie to high fortune Honest nurse farewell

Good even to my ghostly confessor

As much to him else is his thanks too much

Conceit more rich in matter than in words

Brags of his substance not of ornament

They are but beggars that can count their worth

But my true love is grown to such excess

I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth

Gallop apace you fiery-footed steeds

Towards Phoebus' lodging Such a wagoner

As Phaton would whip you to the west

And bring in cloudy night immediately

Spread thy close curtain love-performing night

That runaways' eyes may wink and Romeo

Leap to these arms untalked of and unseen

Lovers can see to do their amorous rites

By their own beauties or if love be blind

It best agrees with night Come civil night

Thou sober-suited matron all in black

And learn me how to lose a winning match

Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods

Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks

With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold

Think true love acted simple modesty

Come night Come Romeo Come thou day in night

For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night

Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back

Come gentle night come loving black-browed night

Give me my Romeo and when I shall die

Take him and cut him out in little stars

And he will make the face of heaven so fine

That all the world will be in love with night

And pay no worship to the garish sun

O I have bought the mansion of a love

But not possessed it and though I am sold

Not yet enjoyed So tedious is this day

As is the night before some festival

To an impatient child that hath new robes

And may not wear them    O here comes my nurse

And she brings news and every tongue that speaks

But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence

Now nurse what news What hast thou there The cords

That Romeo bid thee fetch

Ay me what news Why dost thou wring thy hands

Can heaven be so envious

What devil art thou that dost torment me thus

This torture should be roared in dismal hell

Hath Romeo slain himself Say thou but Ay

And that bare vowel I shall poison more

Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice

I am not I if there be such an I

Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer Ay

If he be slain say Ay or if not No

Brief sounds determine my weal or woe

O break my heart poor bankrout break at once

To prison eyes ne'er look on liberty

Vile earth to earth resign end motion here

And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier

What storm is this that blows so contrary

Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead

My dearest cousin and my dearer lord

Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom

For who is living if those two are gone

O God did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood

O serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face

Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave

Beautiful tyrant fiend angelical

Dove-feathered raven wolvish-ravening lamb

Despisd substance of divinest show

Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st

A damnd saint an honorable villain

O nature what hadst thou to do in hell

When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend

In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh

Was ever book containing such vile matter

So fairly bound O that deceit should dwell

In such a gorgeous palace

Blistered be thy tongue

For such a wish He was not born to shame

Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit

For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned

Sole monarch of the universal Earth

O what a beast was I to chide at him

Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband

Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name

When I thy three-hours wife have mangled it

But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin

That villain cousin would have killed my husband

Back foolish tears back to your native spring

Your tributary drops belong to woe

Which you mistaking offer up to joy

My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain

And Tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband

All this is comfort Wherefore weep I then

Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death

That murdered me I would forget it fain

But O it presses to my memory

Like damnd guilty deeds to sinners' minds

Tybalt is dead and Romeo banishd

That banishd that one word banishd

Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalt's death

Was woe enough if it had ended there

Or if sour woe delights in fellowship

And needly will be ranked with other griefs

Why followed not when she said Tybalt's dead

Thy father or thy mother nay or both

Which modern lamentation might have moved

But with a rearward following Tybalt's death

Romeo is banishd To speak that word

Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet

All slain all dead Romeo is banishd

There is no end no limit measure bound

In that word's death No words can that woe sound

Where is my father and my mother nurse

Wash they his wounds with tears Mine shall be spent

When theirs are dry for Romeo's banishment

Take up those cords  Poor ropes you are beguiled

Both you and I for Romeo is exiled

He made you for a highway to my bed

But I a maid die maiden-widowd

Come cordscome nurse I'll to my wedding bed

And death not Romeo take my maidenhead

O find him Give this ring to my true knight

And bid him come to take his last farewell

Wilt thou be gone It is not yet near day

It was the nightingale and not the lark

That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear

Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree

Believe me love it was the nightingale

Yond light is not daylight I know it I

It is some meteor that the sun exhaled

To be to thee this night a torchbearer

And light thee on thy way to Mantua

Therefore stay yet Thou need'st not to be gone

It is it is Hie hence begone away

It is the lark that sings so out of tune

Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps

Some say the lark makes sweet division

This doth not so for she divideth us

Some say the lark and loathd toad changed eyes

O now I would they had changed voices too

Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray

Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day

O now begone More light and light it grows

Nurse

Then window let day in and let life out

Art thou gone so Love lord ay husband friend

I must hear from thee every day in the hour

For in a minute there are many days

O by this count I shall be much in years

Ere I again behold my Romeo

O think'st thou we shall ever meet again

O God I have an ill-divining soul

Methinks I see thee now thou art so low

As one dead in the bottom of a tomb

Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale

O Fortune Fortune all men call thee fickle

If thou art fickle what dost thou with him

That is renowned for faith Be fickle Fortune

For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long

But send him back

Who is 't that calls It is my lady mother

Is she not down so late or up so early

What unaccustomed cause procures her hither

Madam I am not well

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss

Feeling so the loss

I cannot choose but ever weep the friend

What villain madam

Villain and he be many miles asunder

God pardon him I do with all my heart

And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart

Ay madam from the reach of these my hands

Would none but I might venge my cousin's death

Indeed I never shall be satisfied

With Romeo till I behold himdead

Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexed

Madam if you could find out but a man

To bear a poison I would temper it

That Romeo should upon receipt thereof

Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors

To hear him named and cannot come to him

To wreak the love I bore my cousin

Upon his body that hath slaughtered him

And joy comes well in such a needy time

What are they beseech your Ladyship

Madam in happy time What day is that

Now by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too

He shall not make me there a joyful bride

I wonder at this haste that I must wed

Ere he that should be husband comes to woo

I pray you tell my lord and father madam

I will not marry yet and when I do I swear

It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate

Rather than Paris These are news indeed

Not proud you have but thankful that you have

Proud can I never be of what I hate

But thankful even for hate that is meant love

Good father I beseech you on my knees

Hear me with patience but to speak a word

Is there no pity sitting in the clouds

That sees into the bottom of my grief

O sweet my mother cast me not away

Delay this marriage for a month a week

Or if you do not make the bridal bed

In that dim monument where Tybalt lies

O God O nurse how shall this be prevented

My husband is on Earth my faith in heaven

How shall that faith return again to Earth

Unless that husband send it me from heaven

By leaving Earth Comfort me counsel me

Alack alack that heaven should practice stratagems

Upon so soft a subject as myself

What sayst thou Hast thou not a word of joy

Some comfort nurse

Speak'st thou from thy heart

Amen

Well thou hast comforted me marvelous much

Go in and tell my lady I am gone

Having displeased my father to Lawrence' cell

To make confession and to be absolved

Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend

Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn

Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue

Which she hath praised him with above compare

So many thousand times Go counselor

Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain

I'll to the Friar to know his remedy

If all else fail myself have power to die

That may be sir when I may be a wife

What must be shall be

To answer that I should confess to you

I will confess to you that I love him

If I do so it will be of more price

Being spoke behind your back than to your face

The tears have got small victory by that

For it was bad enough before their spite

That is no slander sir which is a truth

And what I spake I spake it to my face

It may be so for it is not mine own

Are you at leisure holy father now

Or shall I come to you at evening Mass

O shut the door and when thou hast done so

Come weep with me past hope past care past help

Tell me not friar that thou hearest of this

Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it

If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help

Do thou but call my resolution wise

And with this knife I'll help it presently

God joined my heart and Romeo's thou our hands

And ere this hand by thee to Romeo's sealed

Shall be the label to another deed

Or my true heart with treacherous revolt

Turn to another this shall slay them both

Therefore out of thy long-experienced time

Give me some present counsel or behold

'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife

Shall play the umpire arbitrating that

Which the commission of thy years and art

Could to no issue of true honor bring

Be not so long to speak I long to die

If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy

O bid me leap rather than marry Paris

From off the battlements of any tower

Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk

Where serpents are Chain me with roaring bears

Or hide me nightly in a charnel house

O'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones

With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls

Or bid me go into a new-made grave

And hide me with a dead man in his shroud

Things that to hear them told have made me tremble

And I will do it without fear or doubt

To live an unstained wife to my sweet love

Give me give me O tell not me of fear

Love give me strength and strength shall help afford

Farewell dear father

Where I have learned me to repent the sin

Of disobedient opposition

To you and your behests and am enjoined

By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here

To beg your pardon Pardon I beseech you

Henceforward I am ever ruled by you

I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell

And gave him what becomd love I might

Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty

Nurse will you go with me into my closet

To help me sort such needful ornaments

As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow

Ay those attires are best But gentle nurse

I pray thee leave me to myself tonight

For I have need of many orisons

To move the heavens to smile upon my state

Which well thou knowest is cross and full of sin

No madam we have culled such necessaries

As are behooveful for our state tomorrow

So please you let me now be left alone

And let the Nurse this night sit up with you

For I am sure you have your hands full all

In this so sudden business

FarewellGod knows when we shall meet again

I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins

That almost freezes up the heat of life

I'll call them back again to comfort me

NurseWhat should she do here

My dismal scene I needs must act alone

Come vial

What if this mixture do not work at all

Shall I be married then tomorrow morning

No no this shall forbid it Lie thou there

What if it be a poison which the Friar

Subtly hath ministered to have me dead

Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored

Because he married me before to Romeo

I fear it is And yet methinks it should not

For he hath still been tried a holy man

How if when I am laid into the tomb

I wake before the time that Romeo

Come to redeem me There's a fearful point

Shall I not then be stifled in the vault

To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in

And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes

Or if I live is it not very like

The horrible conceit of death and night

Together with the terror of the place

As in a vault an ancient receptacle

Where for this many hundred years the bones

Of all my buried ancestors are packed

Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth

Lies fest'ring in his shroud where as they say

At some hours in the night spirits resort

Alack alack is it not like that I

So early waking what with loathsome smells

And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth

That living mortals hearing them run mad

O if I wake shall I not be distraught

Environd with all these hideous fears

And madly play with my forefathers' joints

And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud

And in this rage with some great kinsman's bone

As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains

O look methinks I see my cousin's ghost

Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body

Upon a rapier's point Stay Tybalt stay

Romeo Romeo Romeo Here's drink I drink to thee

O comfortable friar where is my lord

I do remember well where I should be

And there I am Where is my Romeo

Go get thee hence for I will not away

What's here A cup closed in my true love's hand

Poison I see hath been his timeless end

O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop

To help me after I will kiss thy lips

Haply some poison yet doth hang on them

To make me die with a restorative

Thy lips are warm

Yea noise Then I'll be brief O happy dagger

This is thy sheath There rust and let me die
