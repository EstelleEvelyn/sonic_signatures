He had none.

His flight was madness. When our actions do not,

Our fears do make us traitors.

Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,

His mansion and his titles in a place

From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;

He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,

The most diminutive of birds, will fight,

Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.

All is the fear, and nothing is the love,

As little is the wisdom, where the flight

So runs against all reason.

Fathered he is, and yet he’s fatherless.

Sirrah, your father’s dead.

And what will you do now? How will you live?

What, with worms and flies?

Poor bird, thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime,

The pitfall nor the gin.

Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?

Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

Thou speak’st with all thy wit,

And yet, i’ faith, with wit enough for thee.

Ay, that he was.

Why, one that swears and lies.

Every one that does so is a traitor

and must be hanged.

Every one.

Why, the honest men.

Now God help thee, poor monkey! But

how wilt thou do for a father?

Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!

Whither should I fly?

I have done no harm. But I remember now

I am in this earthly world, where to do harm

Is often laudable, to do good sometime

Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,

Do I put up that womanly defense

To say I have done no harm?    What are these faces?

I hope in no place so unsanctified

Where such as thou mayst find him.
