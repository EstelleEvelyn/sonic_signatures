


Now princes for the service I have done you

Th' advantage of the time prompts me aloud

To call for recompense Appear it to your mind

That through the sight I bear in things to come

I have abandoned Troy left my possessions

Incurred a traitor's name exposed myself

From certain and possessed conveniences

To doubtful fortunes sequest'ring from me all

That time acquaintance custom and condition

Made tame and most familiar to my nature

And here to do you service am become

As new into the world strange unacquainted

I do beseech you as in way of taste

To give me now a little benefit

Out of those many regist'red in promise

Which you say live to come in my behalf

You have a Trojan prisoner called Antenor

Yesterday took Troy holds him very dear

Oft have youoften have you thanks therefor

Desired my Cressid in right great exchange

Whom Troy hath still denied but this Antenor

I know is such a wrest in their affairs

That their negotiations all must slack

Wanting his manage and they will almost

Give us a prince of blood a son of Priam

In change of him Let him be sent great princes

And he shall buy my daughter and her presence

Shall quite strike off all service I have done

In most accepted pain

Who calls

She comes to you
