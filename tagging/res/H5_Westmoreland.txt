


Shall we call in th' Ambassador my liege

They know your Grace hath cause and means and might

So hath your Highness Never king of England

Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects

Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England

And lie pavilioned in the fields of France

How smooth and even they do bear themselves

As if allegiance in their bosoms sat

Crownd with faith and constant loyalty

Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand

O that we now had here

But one ten thousand of those men in England

That do no work today

Perish the man whose mind is backward now

God's will my liege would you and I alone

Without more help could fight this royal battle

The King hath granted every article

His daughter first and in sequel all

According to their firm proposd natures

Amen
