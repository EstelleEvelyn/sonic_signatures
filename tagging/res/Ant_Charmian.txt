Alexas almost most absolute Alexas where's the

soothsayer that you praised so to th' Queen O that

I knew this husband which you say must charge

his horns with garlands

Is this the manIs 't you sir that know things

Good sir

give me good fortune

Pray then foresee me one

He means in flesh

Wrinkles forbid

Hush

I had rather heat my liver with drinking

Good now some excellent fortune Let me

be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow

them all Let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod

of Jewry may do homage Find me to marry me

with Octavius Caesar and companion me with my

mistress

O excellent I love long life better than figs

Then belike my children shall have no

names Prithee how many boys and wenches must

I have

Out fool I forgive thee for a witch

Nay come Tell Iras hers

E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth

famine

Nay if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication

I cannot scratch mine earPrithee

tell her but a workaday fortune

Well if you were but an inch of fortune

better than I where would you choose it

Our worser thoughts heavens mend Alexas

come his fortune his fortune O let him marry a

woman that cannot go sweet Isis I beseech thee and

let her die too and give him a worse and let worse

follow worse till the worst of all follow him laughing

to his grave fiftyfold a cuckold Good Isis hear me

this prayer though thou deny me a matter of more

weight good Isis I beseech thee

Amen

Not he The Queen

No madam

I did not see him since

Madam methinks if you did love him dearly

You do not hold the method to enforce

The like from him

In each thing give him way cross him in nothing

Tempt him not so too far I wish forbear

In time we hate that which we often fear

But here comes Antony

Madam

Why madam

You think of him too much

Madam I trust not so

O that brave Caesar

The valiant Caesar

By your most gracious pardon

I sing but after you

The music ho

My arm is sore Best play with Mardian

'Twas merry when

You wagered on your angling when your diver

Did hang a salt fish on his hook which he

With fervency drew up

Good madam keep yourself within yourself

The man is innocent

He is afeard to come

Good your Highness patience

Many times madam

Like her O Isis 'tis impossible

Three in Egypt

Cannot make better note

Excellent

A proper man

Nothing madam

Hath he seen majesty Isis else defend

And serving you so long

I warrant you madam

Do Why what else

Madam

Please you retire to your chamber

To th' monument

There lock yourself and send him word you are dead

The soul and body rive not more in parting

Than greatness going off

Be comforted dear madam

A heavy sight

O quietness lady

Lady

O madam madam madam

Peace peace Iras

O Cleopatra thou art taken queen

Madam I will

Behold sir

Dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say

The gods themselves do weep

O eastern star

O break O break

In this wild world So fare thee well

Now boast thee Death in thy possession lies

A lass unparalleled Downy windows close

And golden Phoebus never be beheld

Of eyes again so royal Your crown's awry

I'll mend it and then play

Speak softly Wake her not

Too slow a messenger

O come apace dispatch I partly feel thee

It is well done and fitting for a princess

Descended of so many royal kings

Ah soldier
