


It shall be speeded well

Come I have found you out a stand most fit

Where you may have such vantage on the Duke

He shall not pass you Twice have the trumpets sounded

The generous and gravest citizens

Have hent the gates and very near upon

The Duke is entering Therefore hence away

Now is your time Speak loud and kneel before him

Blessed be your royal Grace

I have stood by my lord and I have heard

Your royal ear abused First hath this woman

Most wrongfully accused your substitute

Who is as free from touch or soil with her

As she from one ungot

I know him for a man divine and holy

Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler

As he's reported by this gentleman

And on my trust a man that never yet

Did as he vouches misreport your Grace

Well he in time may come to clear himself

But at this instant he is sick my lord

Of a strange fever Upon his mere request

Being come to knowledge that there was complaint

Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo came I hither

To speak as from his mouth what he doth know

Is true and false and what he with his oath

And all probation will make up full clear

Whensoever he's convented First for this woman

To justify this worthy nobleman

So vulgarly and personally accused

Her shall you hear disprovd to her eyes

Till she herself confess it

Would he were here my lord for he indeed

Hath set the women on to this complaint

Your provost knows the place where he abides

And he may fetch him
