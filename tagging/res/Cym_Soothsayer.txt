I fast and prayed for their intelligencethus

I saw Jove's bird the Roman eagle winged

From the spongy south to this part of the west

There vanished in the sunbeams which portends

Unless my sins abuse my divination

Success to th' Roman host

Here my good lord

Whenas a lion's whelp shall to

himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced

by a piece of tender air and when from a

stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being

dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the

old stock and freshly grow then shall Posthumus

end his miseries Britain be fortunate and flourish

in peace and plenty

Thou Leonatus art the lion's whelp

The fit and apt construction of thy name

Being Leo-natus doth import so much

The piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter

Which we call mollis aer and mollis aer

We term it mulier which mulier I divine

Is this most constant wife who even now

Answering the letter of the oracle

Unknown to you unsought were clipped about

With this most tender air

The lofty cedar royal Cymbeline

Personates thee and thy lopped branches point

Thy two sons forth who by Belarius stol'n

For many years thought dead are now revived

To the majestic cedar joined whose issue

Promises Britain peace and plenty

The fingers of the powers above do tune

The harmony of this peace The vision

Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke

Of this yet scarce-cold battle at this instant

Is full accomplished For the Roman eagle

From south to west on wing soaring aloft

Lessened herself and in the beams o' th' sun

So vanished which foreshowed our princely eagle

Th' imperial Caesar should again unite

His favor with the radiant Cymbeline

Which shines here in the west
