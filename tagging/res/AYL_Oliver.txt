Now sir what make you here

What mar you then sir

Marry sir be better employed and be naught

awhile

Know you where you are sir

Know you before whom sir

What boy

Wilt thou lay hands on me villain

Let me go I say

And what wilt thou dobeg when that is

spent Well sir get you in I will not long be

troubled with you You shall have some part of your

will I pray you leave me

Get you with him you old dog

Is it even so Begin you to grow upon me I

will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand

crowns neitherHolla Dennis

Was not Charles the Duke's wrestler here to

speak with me

Call him in 'Twill be a good

way and tomorrow the wrestling is

Good Monsieur Charles what's the new news

at the new court

Can you tell if Rosalind the Duke's daughter

be banished with her father

Where will the old duke live

What you wrestle tomorrow before the new

duke

Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which

thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had

myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and

have by underhand means labored to dissuade him

from it but he is resolute I'll tell thee Charles it is

the stubbornest young fellow of France full of

ambition an envious emulator of every man's good

parts a secret and villainous contriver against me

his natural brother Therefore use thy discretion I

had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger

And thou wert best look to 't for if thou dost him

any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace

himself on thee he will practice against thee by

poison entrap thee by some treacherous device

and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by

some indirect means or other For I assure thee

and almost with tears I speak itthere is not one so

young and so villainous this day living I speak but

brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to

thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must

look pale and wonder

Farewell good Charles

Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an

end of him for my soulyet I know not why

hates nothing more than he Yet he's gentle never

schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all

sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in

the heart of the world and especially of my own

people who best know him that I am altogether

misprized But it shall not be so long this wrestler

shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the

boy thither which now I'll go about

O that your Highness knew my heart in this

I never loved my brother in my life

Good morrow fair ones Pray you if you know

Where in the purlieus of this forest stands

A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees

If that an eye may profit by a tongue

Then should I know you by description

Such garments and such years The boy is fair

Of female favor and bestows himself

Like a ripe sister the woman low

And browner than her brother Are not you

The owner of the house I did inquire for

Orlando doth commend him to you both

And to that youth he calls his Rosalind

He sends this bloody napkin Are you he

Some of my shame if you will know of me

What man I am and how and why and where

This handkercher was stained

When last the young Orlando parted from you

He left a promise to return again

Within an hour and pacing through the forest

Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy

Lo what befell He threw his eye aside

And mark what object did present itself

Under an old oak whose boughs were mossed with age

And high top bald with dry antiquity

A wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair

Lay sleeping on his back About his neck

A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself

Who with her head nimble in threats approached

The opening of his mouth But suddenly

Seeing Orlando it unlinked itself

And with indented glides did slip away

Into a bush under which bush's shade

A lioness with udders all drawn dry

Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch

When that the sleeping man should stirfor 'tis

The royal disposition of that beast

To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead

This seen Orlando did approach the man

And found it was his brother his elder brother

And well he might so do

For well I know he was unnatural

Twice did he turn his back and purposed so

But kindness nobler ever than revenge

And nature stronger than his just occasion

Made him give battle to the lioness

Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling

From miserable slumber I awaked

'Twas I but 'tis not I I do not shame

To tell you what I was since my conversion

So sweetly tastes being the thing I am

By and by

When from the first to last betwixt us two

Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed

As how I came into that desert place

In brief he led me to the gentle duke

Who gave me fresh array and entertainment

Committing me unto my brother's love

Who led me instantly unto his cave

There stripped himself and here upon his arm

The lioness had torn some flesh away

Which all this while had bled and now he fainted

And cried in fainting upon Rosalind

Brief I recovered him bound up his wound

And after some small space being strong at heart

He sent me hither stranger as I am

To tell this story that you might excuse

His broken promise and to give this napkin

Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth

That he in sport doth call his Rosalind

Many will swoon when they do look on blood

Look he recovers

Be of good cheer

youth You a man You lack a man's heart

This was not counterfeit There is too great

testimony in your complexion that it was a passion

of earnest

Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to

be a man

That will I for I must bear answer back

How you excuse my brother Rosalind

Neither call the giddiness of it in question the

poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden

wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with

me I love Aliena say with her that she loves me

consent with both that we may enjoy each other It

shall be to your good for my father's house and all

the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate

upon you and here live and die a shepherd

And you fair sister
