He came not back He is or ta'en or slain

What I my lord No not for all the world

I'll rather kill myself

O Dardanus

What ill request did Brutus make to thee

Now is that noble vessel full of grief

That it runs over even at his eyes

Fly fly my lord There is no tarrying here

Fly my lord fly
