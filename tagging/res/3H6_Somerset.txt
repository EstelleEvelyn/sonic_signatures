


My lords forbear this talk Here comes the King

What are they that fly there

My liege it is young Henry Earl of Richmond

My lord I like not of this flight of Edward's

For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help

And we shall have more wars before 't be long

As Henry's late presaging prophecy

Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond

So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts

What may befall him to his harm and ours

Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst

Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany

Till storms be past of civil enmity

It shall be so He shall to Brittany

Come therefore let's about it speedily

Somerset Somerset for Lancaster

Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are

We might recover all our loss again

The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power

Even now we heard the news Ah could'st thou fly

Ah Warwick Montague hath breathed his last

And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick

And said Commend me to my valiant brother

And more he would have said and more he spoke

Which sounded like a cannon in a vault

That mought not be distinguished but at last

I well might hear delivered with a groan

O farewell Warwick

And he that will not fight for such a hope

Go home to bed and like the owl by day

If he arise be mocked and wondered at

But he's deceived We are in readiness

Nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune
