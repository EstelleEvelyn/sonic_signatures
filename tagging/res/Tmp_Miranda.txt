


If by your art my dearest father you have

Put the wild waters in this roar allay them

The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch

But that the sea mounting to th' welkin's cheek

Dashes the fire out O I have suffered

With those that I saw suffer A brave vessel

Who had no doubt some noble creature in her

Dashed all to pieces O the cry did knock

Against my very heart Poor souls they perished

Had I been any god of power I would

Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere

It should the good ship so have swallowed and

The fraughting souls within her

O woe the day

More to know

Did never meddle with my thoughts

You have often

Begun to tell me what I am but stopped

And left me to a bootless inquisition

Concluding Stay Not yet

Certainly sir I can

'Tis far off

And rather like a dream than an assurance

That my remembrance warrants Had I not

Four or five women once that tended me

But that I do not

Sir are not you my father

O the heavens

What foul play had we that we came from thence

Or blessd was 't we did

O my heart bleeds

To think o' th' teen that I have turned you to

Which is from my remembrance Please you farther

Sir most heedfully

O good sir I do

Your tale sir would cure deafness

O the heavens

I should sin

To think but nobly of my grandmother

Good wombs have borne bad sons

Alack for pity

I not rememb'ring how I cried out then

Will cry it o'er again It is a hint

That wrings mine eyes to 't

Wherefore did they not

That hour destroy us

Alack what trouble

Was I then to you

How came we ashore

Would I might

But ever see that man

Heavens thank you for 't And now I pray you sir

For still 'tis beating in my mindyour reason

For raising this sea storm

The strangeness of your story put

Heaviness in me

'Tis a villain sir

I do not love to look on

Abhorrd slave

Which any print of goodness wilt not take

Being capable of all ill I pitied thee

Took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour

One thing or other When thou didst not savage

Know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like

A thing most brutish I endowed thy purposes

With words that made them known But thy vile race

Though thou didst learn had that in 't which good natures

Could not abide to be with Therefore wast thou

Deservedly confined into this rock

Who hadst deserved more than a prison

What is 't A spirit

Lord how it looks about Believe me sir

It carries a brave form But 'tis a spirit

I might call him

A thing divine for nothing natural

I ever saw so noble

No wonder sir

But certainly a maid

Alack for mercy

Why speaks my father so ungently This

Is the third man that e'er I saw the first

That e'er I sighed for Pity move my father

To be inclined my way

There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple

If the ill spirit have so fair a house

Good things will strive to dwell with 't

O dear father

Make not too rash a trial of him for

He's gentle and not fearful

Beseech you father

Sir have pity

I'll be his surety

My affections

Are then most humble I have no ambition

To see a goodlier man

Be of comfort

My father's of a better nature sir

Than he appears by speech This is unwonted

Which now came from him

Alas now pray you

Work not so hard I would the lightning had

Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile

Pray set it down and rest you When this burns

'Twill weep for having wearied you My father

Is hard at study Pray now rest yourself

He's safe for these three hours

If you'll sit down

I'll bear your logs the while Pray give me that

I'll carry it to the pile

It would become me

As well as it does you and I should do it

With much more ease for my good will is to it

And yours it is against

You look wearily

MirandaO my father

I have broke your hest to say so

I do not know

One of my sex no woman's face remember

Save from my glass mine own Nor have I seen

More that I may call men than you good friend

And my dear father How features are abroad

I am skilless of but by my modesty

The jewel in my dower I would not wish

Any companion in the world but you

Nor can imagination form a shape

Besides yourself to like of But I prattle

Something too wildly and my father's precepts

I therein do forget

Do you love me

I am a fool

To weep at what I am glad of

At mine unworthiness that dare not offer

What I desire to give and much less take

What I shall die to want But this is trifling

And all the more it seeks to hide itself

The bigger bulk it shows Hence bashful cunning

And prompt me plain and holy innocence

I am your wife if you will marry me

If not I'll die your maid To be your fellow

You may deny me but I'll be your servant

Whether you will or no

My husband then

And mine with my heart in 't And now farewell

Till half an hour hence

Never till this day

Saw I him touched with anger so distempered

We wish your peace

Sweet lord you play me false

Yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle

And I would call it fair play

O wonder

How many goodly creatures are there here

How beauteous mankind is O brave new world

That has such people in 't
