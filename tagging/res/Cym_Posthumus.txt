
Please your Highness

I will from hence today

My queen my mistress

O lady weep no more lest I give cause

To be suspected of more tenderness

Than doth become a man I will remain

The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth

My residence in Rome at one Philario's

Who to my father was a friend to me

Known but by letter thither write my queen

And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send

Though ink be made of gall

Should we be taking leave

As long a term as yet we have to live

The loathness to depart would grow Adieu

How how Another

You gentle gods give me but this I have

And cere up my embracements from a next

With bonds of death Remain remain thou here

While sense can keep it onAnd sweetest fairest

As I my poor self did exchange for you

To your so infinite loss so in our trifles

I still win of you For my sake wear this

It is a manacle of love I'll place it

Upon this fairest prisoner

Alack the King

The gods protect you

And bless the good remainders of the court

I am gone

Since when I have been debtor to you for

courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay

still

By your pardon sir I was then a young

traveler rather shunned to go even with what I

heard than in my every action to be guided by others'

experiences But upon my mended judgment

if I offend not to say it is mendedmy

quarrel was not altogether slight

She holds her virtue still and I my mind

Being so far provoked as I was in France

I would abate her nothing though I profess myself

her adorer not her friend

I praised her as I rated her So do I my

stone

More than the world enjoys

You are mistaken The one may be sold or

given or if there were wealth enough for the purchase

or merit for the gift The other is not a thing

for sale and only the gift of the gods

Which by their graces I will keep

Your Italy contains none so accomplished

a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress if

in the holding or loss of that you term her frail I

do nothing doubt you have store of thieves

notwithstanding I fear not my ring

Sir with all my heart This worthy signior

I thank him makes no stranger of me We are

familiar at first

No no

You are a great deal abused in too bold a

persuasion and I doubt not you sustain what

you're worthy of by your attempt

A repulsethough your attempt as you

call it deserve more a punishment too

What lady would you choose to assail

I will wage against your gold gold to it

My ring I hold dear as my finger 'tis part of it

This is but a custom in your tongue You

bear a graver purpose I hope

Will you I shall but lend my diamond till

your return Let there be covenants drawn between

's My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness

of your unworthy thinking I dare you to this

match Here's my ring

I embrace these conditions Let us have

articles betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer

if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly

to understand you have prevailed I am no

further your enemy she is not worth our debate If

she remain unseduced you not making it appear

otherwise for your ill opinion and th' assault you

have made to her chastity you shall answer me

with your sword

Agreed

Fear it not sir I would I were so sure

To win the King as I am bold her honor

Will remain hers

Not any but abide the change of time

Quake in the present winter's state and wish

That warmer days would come In these feared hopes

I barely gratify your love they failing

I must die much your debtor

I do believe

Statist though I am none nor like to be

That this will prove a war and you shall hear

The legion now in Gallia sooner landed

In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings

Of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen

Are men more ordered than when Julius Caesar

Smiled at their lack of skill but found their courage

Worthy his frowning at Their discipline

Now wingd with their courages will make known

To their approvers they are people such

That mend upon the world

The swiftest harts have posted you by land

And winds of all the corners kissed your sails

To make your vessel nimble

I hope the briefness of your answer made

The speediness of your return

And therewithal the best or let her beauty

Look thorough a casement to allure false hearts

And be false with them

Their tenor good I trust

All is well yet

Sparkles this stone as it was wont or is 't not

Too dull for your good wearing

The stone's too hard to come by

Make not sir

Your loss your sport I hope you know that we

Must not continue friends

If you can make 't apparent

That you have tasted her in bed my hand

And ring is yours If not the foul opinion

You had of her pure honor gains or loses

Your sword or mine or masterless leave both

To who shall find them

Proceed

This is true

And this you might have heard of here by me

Or by some other

So they must

Or do your honor injury

This is a thing

Which you might from relation likewise reap

Being as it is much spoke of

This is her honor

Let it be granted you have seen all thisand praise

Be given to your remembrancethe description

Of what is in her chamber nothing saves

The wager you have laid

Jove

Once more let me behold it Is it that

Which I left with her

Maybe she plucked it off

To send it me

O no no no 'tis true Here take this too

It is a basilisk unto mine eye

Kills me to look on 't Let there be no honor

Where there is beauty truth where semblance love

Where there's another man The vows of women

Of no more bondage be to where they are made

Than they are to their virtues which is nothing

O above measure false

Very true

And so I hope he came by 'tBack my ring

Render to me some corporal sign about her

More evident than this for this was stol'n

Hark you he swears By Jupiter he swears

'Tis truenay keep the ring'tis true  I am sure

She would not lose it Her attendants are

All sworn and honorable They induced to steal it

And by a stranger No he hath enjoyed her

The cognizance of her incontinency

Is this She hath bought the name of whore thus dearly

There take thy hire and all the fiends of hell

Divide themselves between you

Never talk on 't

She hath been colted by him

Ay and it doth confirm

Another stain as big as hell can hold

Were there no more but it

Spare your arithmetic

Never count the turns Once and a million

No swearing

If you will swear you have not done 't you lie

And I will kill thee if thou dost deny

Thou 'st made me cuckold

O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal

I will go there and do 't i' th' court before

Her father I'll do something

Is there no way for men to be but women

Must be half-workers We are all bastards

And that most venerable man which I

Did call my father was I know not where

When I was stamped Some coiner with his tools

Made me a counterfeit yet my mother seemed

The Dian of that time so doth my wife

The nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance

Me of my lawful pleasure she restrained

And prayed me oft forbearance did it with

A pudency so rosy the sweet view on 't

Might well have warmed old Saturn that I thought her

As chaste as unsunned snow O all the devils

This yellow Iachimo in an hour was 't not

Or less At first Perchance he spoke not but

Like a full-acorned boar a German one

Cried O and mounted found no opposition

But what he looked for should oppose and she

Should from encounter guard Could I find out

The woman's part in mefor there's no motion

That tends to vice in man but I affirm

It is the woman's part be it lying note it

The woman's flattering hers deceiving hers

Lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers

Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain

Nice longing slanders mutability

All faults that have a name nay that hell knows

Why hers in part or all but rather all

For even to vice

They are not constant but are changing still

One vice but of a minute old for one

Not half so old as that I'll write against them

Detest them curse them Yet 'tis greater skill

In a true hate to pray they have their will

The very devils cannot plague them better

Yea bloody cloth I'll keep thee for I wished

Thou shouldst be colored thus You married ones

If each of you should take this course how many

Must murder wives much better than themselves

For wrying but a little O Pisanio

Every good servant does not all commands

No bond but to do just ones Gods if you

Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults I never

Had lived to put on this so had you saved

The noble Imogen to repent and struck

Me wretch more worth your vengeance But alack

You snatch some hence for little faults that's love

To have them fall no more you some permit

To second ills with ills each elder worse

And make them dread it to the doers' thrift

But Imogen is your own Do your best wills

And make me blest to obey I am brought hither

Among th' Italian gentry and to fight

Against my lady's kingdom 'Tis enough

That Britain I have killed thy mistress Peace

I'll give no wound to thee Therefore good heavens

Hear patiently my purpose I'll disrobe me

Of these Italian weeds and suit myself

As does a Briton peasant So I'll fight

Against the part I come with so I'll die

For thee O Imogen even for whom my life

Is every breath a death And thus unknown

Pitied nor hated to the face of peril

Myself I'll dedicate Let me make men know

More valor in me than my habits show

Gods put the strength o' th' Leonati in me

To shame the guise o' th' world I will begin

The fashion less without and more within

I did

Though you it seems come from the fliers

No blame be to you sir for all was lost

But that the heavens fought The King himself

Of his wings destitute the army broken

And but the backs of Britons seen all flying

Through a strait lane the enemy full-hearted

Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring having work

More plentiful than tools to do 't struck down

Some mortally some slightly touched some falling

Merely through fear that the strait pass was dammed

With dead men hurt behind and cowards living

To die with lengthened shame

Close by the battle ditched and walled with turf

Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier

An honest one I warrant who deserved

So long a breeding as his white beard came to

In doing this for 's country Athwart the lane

He with two striplingslads more like to run

The country base than to commit such slaughter

With faces fit for masks or rather fairer

Than those for preservation cased or shame

Made good the passage cried to those that fled

Our Britain's harts die flying not our men

To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards Stand

Or we are Romans and will give you that

Like beasts which you shun beastly and may save

But to look back in frown Stand stand These three

Three thousand confident in act as many

For three performers are the file when all

The rest do nothingwith this word Stand stand

Accommodated by the place more charming

With their own nobleness which could have turned

A distaff to a lance gilded pale looks

Part shame part spirit renewed that some turned coward

But by exampleO a sin in war

Damned in the first beginnersgan to look

The way that they did and to grin like lions

Upon the pikes o' th' hunters Then began

A stop i' th' chaser a retire anon

A rout confusion thick Forthwith they fly

Chickens the way which they stooped eagles slaves

The strides they victors made and now our cowards

Like fragments in hard voyages became

The life o' th' need Having found the backdoor open

Of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound

Some slain before some dying some their friends

O'erborne i' th' former wave ten chased by one

Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty

Those that would die or ere resist are grown

The mortal bugs o' th' field

Nay do not wonder at it You are made

Rather to wonder at the things you hear

Than to work any Will you rhyme upon 't

And vent it for a mock'ry Here is one

Two boys an old man twice a boy a lane

Preserved the Britons was the Romans' bane

'Lack to what end

Who dares not stand his foe I'll be his friend

For if he'll do as he is made to do

I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too

You have put me into rhyme

Still going This is a lord O noble misery

To be i' th' field and ask What news of me

Today how many would have given their honors

To have saved their carcasses took heel to do 't

And yet died too I in mine own woe charmed

Could not find Death where I did hear him groan

Nor feel him where he struck Being an ugly monster

'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds

Sweet words or hath more ministers than we

That draw his knives i' th' war Well I will find him

For being now a favorer to the Briton

No more a BritonI have resumed again

The part I came in Fight I will no more

But yield me to the veriest hind that shall

Once touch my shoulder Great the slaughter is

Here made by th' Roman great the answer be

Britons must take For me my ransom's death

On either side I come to spend my breath

Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again

But end it by some means for Imogen

A Roman

Who had not now been drooping here if seconds

Had answered him

Most welcome bondage for thou art a way

I think to liberty Yet am I better

Than one that's sick o' th' gout since he had rather

Groan so in perpetuity than be cured

By th' sure physician Death who is the key

T' unbar these locks My conscience thou art fettered

More than my shanks and wrists You good gods give me

The penitent instrument to pick that bolt

Then free forever Is 't enough I am sorry

So children temporal fathers do appease

Gods are more full of mercy Must I repent

I cannot do it better than in gyves

Desired more than constrained To satisfy

If of my freedom 'tis the main part take

No stricter render of me than my all

I know you are more clement than vile men

Who of their broken debtors take a third

A sixth a tenth letting them thrive again

On their abatement That's not my desire

For Imogen's dear life take mine and though

'Tis not so dear yet 'tis a life you coined it

'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp

Though light take pieces for the figure's sake

You rather mine being yours And so great powers

If you will take this audit take this life

And cancel these cold bonds O Imogen

I'll speak to thee in silence

Sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot

A father to me and thou hast created

A mother and two brothers But O scorn

Gone They went hence so soon as they were born

And so I am awake Poor wretches that depend

On greatness' favor dream as I have done

Wake and find nothing But alas I swerve

Many dream not to find neither deserve

And yet are steeped in favors so am I

That have this golden chance and know not why

What fairies haunt this ground A book O rare one

Be not as is our fangled world a garment

Nobler than that it covers Let thy effects

So follow to be most unlike our courtiers

As good as promise

Whenas a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown

without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of

tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be

lopped branches which being dead many years shall

after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly

grow then shall Posthumus end his miseries Britain

be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty

'Tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen

Tongue and brain not either both or nothing

Or senseless speaking or a speaking such

As sense cannot untie Be what it is

The action of my life is like it which

I'll keep if but for sympathy

Over-roasted rather ready long ago

So if I prove a good repast to the spectators

the dish pays the shot

I am merrier to die than thou art to live

Yes indeed do I fellow

I tell thee fellow there are none want

eyes to direct them the way I am going but such as

wink and will not use them

Thou bring'st good news I am called to be

made free

Thou shalt be then freer than a jailer No

bolts for the dead

What's that to him

Ay so thou dost

Italian fiendAy me most credulous fool

Egregious murderer thief anything

That's due to all the villains past in being

To come O give me cord or knife or poison

Some upright justicerThou king send out

For torturers ingenious It is I

That all th' abhorrd things o' th' Earth amend

By being worse than they I am Posthumus

That killed thy daughtervillainlike I lie

That caused a lesser villain than myself

A sacrilegious thief to do 't The temple

Of virtue was she yea and she herself

Spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set

The dogs o' th' street to bay me Every villain

Be called Posthumus Leonatus and

Be villainy less than 'twas O Imogen

My queen my life my wife O Imogen

Imogen Imogen

Shall 's have a play of this Thou scornful page

There lie thy part

How comes these staggers on me

Hang there like fruit my soul

Till the tree die

I am sir

The soldier that did company these three

In poor beseeming 'twas a fitment for

The purpose I then followed That I was he

Speak Iachimo I had you down and might

Have made you finish

Kneel not to me

The power that I have on you is to spare you

The malice towards you to forgive you Live

And deal with others better

Your servant princesGood my lord of Rome

Call forth your soothsayer As I slept methought

Great Jupiter upon his eagle backed

Appeared to me with other spritely shows

Of mine own kindred When I waked I found

This label on my bosom whose containing

Is so from sense in hardness that I can

Make no collection of it Let him show

His skill in the construction
