


Now say Chatillion what would France with us

Silence good mother Hear the embassy

What follows if we disallow of this

Here have we war for war and blood for blood

Controlment for controlment so answer France

Bear mine to him and so depart in peace

Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France

For ere thou canst report I will be there

The thunder of my cannon shall be heard

So hence Be thou the trumpet of our wrath

And sullen presage of your own decay

An honorable conduct let him have

Pembroke look to 'tFarewell Chatillion

Our strong possession and our right for us

Let them approach

Our abbeys and our priories shall pay

This expedition's charge    What men are you

What art thou

Is that the elder and art thou the heir

You came not of one mother then it seems

A good blunt fellowWhy being younger born

Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance

Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here

Mine eye hath well examind his parts

And finds them perfect RichardSirrah speak

What doth move you to claim your brother's land

Sirrah your brother is legitimate

Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him

An if she did play false the fault was hers

Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands

That marry wives Tell me how if my brother

Who as you say took pains to get this son

Had of your father claimed this son for his

In sooth good friend your father might have kept

This calf bred from his cow from all the world

In sooth he might Then if he were my brother's

My brother might not claim him nor your father

Being none of his refuse him This concludes

My mother's son did get your father's heir

Your father's heir must have your father's land

What is thy name

From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest

Kneel thou down Philip but rise more great

Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet

Go Faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire

A landless knight makes thee a landed squire

Come madamand come Richard We must speed

For France for France for it is more than need

Peace be to France if France in peace permit

Our just and lineal entrance to our own

If not bleed France and peace ascend to heaven

Whiles we God's wrathful agent do correct

Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven

From whom hast thou this great commission France

To draw my answer from thy articles

Alack thou dost usurp authority

My life as soon I do defy thee France

Arthur of Brittany yield thee to my hand

And out of my dear love I'll give thee more

Than e'er the coward hand of France can win

Submit thee boy

Bedlam have done

England for itself

You men of Angiers and my loving subjects

For our advantage Therefore hear us first

These flags of France that are advancd here

Before the eye and prospect of your town

Have hither marched to your endamagement

The cannons have their bowels full of wrath

And ready mounted are they to spit forth

Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls

All preparation for a bloody siege

And merciless proceeding by these French

Confronts your city's eyes your winking gates

And but for our approach those sleeping stones

That as a waist doth girdle you about

By the compulsion of their ordinance

By this time from their fixd beds of lime

Had been dishabited and wide havoc made

For bloody power to rush upon your peace

But on the sight of us your lawful king

Who painfully with much expedient march

Have brought a countercheck before your gates

To save unscratched your city's threatened cheeks

Behold the French amazed vouchsafe a parle

And now instead of bullets wrapped in fire

To make a shaking fever in your walls

They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke

To make a faithless error in your ears

Which trust accordingly kind citizens

And let us in Your king whose labored spirits

Forwearied in this action of swift speed

Craves harborage within your city walls

Acknowledge then the King and let me in

Doth not the crown of England prove the King

And if not that I bring you witnesses

Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed

To verify our title with their lives

Then God forgive the sin of all those souls

That to their everlasting residence

Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet

In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king

Up higher to the plain where we'll set forth

In best appointment all our regiments

France hast thou yet more blood to cast away

Say shall the current of our right roam on

Whose passage vexed with thy impediment

Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell

With course disturbed even thy confining shores

Unless thou let his silver water keep

A peaceful progress to the ocean

Whose party do the townsmen yet admit

In us that are our own great deputy

And bear possession of our person here

Lord of our presence Angiers and of you

Now by the sky that hangs above our heads

I like it well France shall we knit our powers

And lay this Angiers even with the ground

Then after fight who shall be king of it

We from the west will send destruction

Into this city's bosom

Speak on with favor We are bent to hear

If that the Dauphin there thy princely son

Can in this book of beauty read I love

Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen

For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poitiers

And all that we upon this side the sea

Except this city now by us besieged

Find liable to our crown and dignity

Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich

In titles honors and promotions

As she in beauty education blood

Holds hand with any princess of the world

What say these young ones What say you my niece

Speak then Prince Dauphin Can you love this lady

Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine

Poitiers and Anjou these five provinces

With her to thee and this addition more

Full thirty thousand marks of English coin

Philip of France if thou be pleased withal

Command thy son and daughter to join hands

We will heal up all

For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Brittany

And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town

We make him lord ofCall the Lady Constance

Some speedy messenger bid her repair

To our solemnity I trust we shall

If not fill up the measure of her will

Yet in some measure satisfy her so

That we shall stop her exclamation

Go we as well as haste will suffer us

To this unlooked-for unprepard pomp

We like not this Thou dost forget thyself

What earthy name to interrogatories

Can task the free breath of a sacred king

Thou canst not cardinal devise a name

So slight unworthy and ridiculous

To charge me to an answer as the Pope

Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England

Add thus much more that no Italian priest

Shall tithe or toll in our dominions

But as we under God are supreme head

So under Him that great supremacy

Where we do reign we will alone uphold

Without th' assistance of a mortal hand

So tell the Pope all reverence set apart

To him and his usurped authority

Though you and all the kings of Christendom

Are led so grossly by this meddling priest

Dreading the curse that money may buy out

And by the merit of vile gold dross dust

Purchase corrupted pardon of a man

Who in that sale sells pardon from himself

Though you and all the rest so grossly led

This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish

Yet I alone alone do me oppose

Against the Pope and count his friends my foes

Philip what sayst thou to the Cardinal

The King is moved and answers not to this

France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour

Cousin go draw our puissance together

France I am burned up with inflaming wrath

A rage whose heat hath this condition

That nothing can allay nothing but blood

The blood and dearest-valued blood of France

No more than he that threatsTo arms let's hie

Hubert keep this boyPhilip make up

My mother is assaild in our tent

And ta'en I fear

So shall it be Your Grace shall stay behind

So strongly guarded Cousin look not sad

Thy grandam loves thee and thy uncle will

As dear be to thee as thy father was

Cousin away for England Haste before

And ere our coining see thou shake the bags

Of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels

Set at liberty The fat ribs of peace

Must by the hungry now be fed upon

Use our commission in his utmost force

Coz farewell

Come hither Hubert O my gentle Hubert

We owe thee much Within this wall of flesh

There is a soul counts thee her creditor

And with advantage means to pay thy love

And my good friend thy voluntary oath

Lives in this bosom dearly cherishd

Give me thy hand I had a thing to say

But I will fit it with some better tune

By heaven Hubert I am almost ashamed

To say what good respect I have of thee

Good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet

But thou shalt have And creep time ne'er so slow

Yet it shall come for me to do thee good

I had a thing to saybut let it go

The sun is in the heaven and the proud day

Attended with the pleasures of the world

Is all too wanton and too full of gauds

To give me audience If the midnight bell

Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth

Sound on into the drowsy race of night

If this same were a churchyard where we stand

And thou possessd with a thousand wrongs

Or if that surly spirit melancholy

Had baked thy blood and made it heavy thick

Which else runs tickling up and down the veins

Making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes

And strain their cheeks to idle merriment

A passion hateful to my purposes

Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes

Hear me without thine ears and make reply

Without a tongue using conceit alone

Without eyes ears and harmful sound of words

Then in despite of brooded watchful day

I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts

But ah I will not Yet I love thee well

And by my troth I think thou lov'st me well

Do not I know thou wouldst

Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye

On yon young boy I'll tell thee what my friend

He is a very serpent in my way

And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread

He lies before me Dost thou understand me

Thou art his keeper

Death

A grave

Enough

I could be merry now Hubert I love thee

Well I'll not say what I intend for thee

Remember Madam fare you well

I'll send those powers o'er to your Majesty

For England cousin go

Hubert shall be your man attend on you

With all true dutyOn toward Calais ho

Here once again we sit once again crowned

And looked upon I hope with cheerful eyes

Some reasons of this double coronation

I have possessed you with and think them strong

And more more strong when lesser is my fear

I shall endue you with Meantime but ask

What you would have reformed that is not well

And well shall you perceive how willingly

I will both hear and grant you your requests

Let it be so I do commit his youth

To your direction    Hubert what news with you

We cannot hold mortality's strong hand

Good lords although my will to give is living

The suit which you demand is gone and dead

He tells us Arthur is deceased tonight

Why do you bend such solemn brows on me

Think you I bear the shears of destiny

Have I commandment on the pulse of life

They burn in indignation I repent

There is no sure foundation set on blood

No certain life achieved by others' death

A fearful eye thou hast Where is that blood

That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks

So foul a sky clears not without a storm

Pour down thy weather how goes all in France

O where hath our intelligence been drunk

Where hath it slept Where is my mother's care

That such an army could be drawn in France

And she not hear of it

Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion

O make a league with me till I have pleased

My discontented peers What Mother dead

How wildly then walks my estate in France

Under whose conduct came those powers of France

That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here

Thou hast made me giddy

With these ill tidings    Now what says the world

To your proceedings Do not seek to stuff

My head with more ill news for it is full

Bear with me cousin for I was amazed

Under the tide but now I breathe again

Aloft the flood and can give audience

To any tongue speak it of what it will

Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so

Hubert away with him Imprison him

And on that day at noon whereon he says

I shall yield up my crown let him be hanged

Deliver him to safety and return

For I must use thee O my gentle cousin

Hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived

Gentle kinsman go

And thrust thyself into their companies

I have a way to win their loves again

Bring them before me

Nay but make haste the better foot before

O let me have no subject enemies

When adverse foreigners affright my towns

With dreadful pomp of stout invasion

Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels

And fly like thought from them to me again

Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman

Go after him for he perhaps shall need

Some messenger betwixt me and the peers

And be thou he

My mother dead

Five moons

Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears

Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death

Thy hand hath murdered him I had a mighty cause

To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him

It is the curse of kings to be attended

By slaves that take their humors for a warrant

To break within the bloody house of life

And on the winking of authority

To understand a law to know the meaning

Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns

More upon humor than advised respect

O when the last accompt twixt heaven and Earth

Is to be made then shall this hand and seal

Witness against us to damnation

How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds

Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by

A fellow by the hand of nature marked

Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame

This murder had not come into my mind

But taking note of thy abhorred aspect

Finding thee fit for bloody villainy

Apt liable to be employed in danger

I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death

And thou to be endeard to a king

Made it no conscience to destroy a prince

Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause

When I spake darkly what I purposd

Or turned an eye of doubt upon my face

As bid me tell my tale in express words

Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off

And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me

But thou didst understand me by my signs

And didst in signs again parley with sin

Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent

And consequently thy rude hand to act

The deed which both our tongues held vile to name

Out of my sight and never see me more

My nobles leave me and my state is braved

Even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers

Nay in the body of this fleshly land

This kingdom this confine of blood and breath

Hostility and civil tumult reigns

Between my conscience and my cousin's death

Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers

Throw this report on their incensd rage

And make them tame to their obedience

Forgive the comment that my passion made

Upon thy feature for my rage was blind

And foul imaginary eyes of blood

Presented thee more hideous than thou art

O answer not but to my closet bring

The angry lords with all expedient haste

I conjure thee but slowly run more fast

Thus have I yielded up into your hand

The circle of my glory

Now keep your holy word Go meet the French

And from his Holiness use all your power

To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed

Our discontented counties do revolt

Our people quarrel with obedience

Swearing allegiance and the love of soul

To stranger blood to foreign royalty

This inundation of mistempered humor

Rests by you only to be qualified

Then pause not for the present time's so sick

That present med'cine must be ministered

Or overthrow incurable ensues

Is this Ascension Day Did not the prophet

Say that before Ascension Day at noon

My crown I should give off Even so I have

I did suppose it should be on constraint

But God be thanked it is but voluntary

Would not my lords return to me again

After they heard young Arthur was alive

That villain Hubert told me he did live

The legate of the Pope hath been with me

And I have made a happy peace with him

And he hath promised to dismiss the powers

Led by the Dauphin

Have thou the ordering of this present time

How goes the day with us O tell me Hubert

This fever that hath troubled me so long

Lies heavy on me O my heart is sick

Tell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there

Ay me this tyrant fever burns me up

And will not let me welcome this good news

Set on toward Swinstead To my litter straight

Weakness possesseth me and I am faint

Ay marry now my soul hath elbow-room

It would not out at windows nor at doors

There is so hot a summer in my bosom

That all my bowels crumble up to dust

I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen

Upon a parchment and against this fire

Do I shrink up

Poisonedill faredead forsook cast off

And none of you will bid the winter come

To thrust his icy fingers in my maw

Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course

Through my burned bosom nor entreat the North

To make his bleak winds kiss my parchd lips

And comfort me with cold I do not ask you much

I beg cold comfort and you are so strait

And so ingrateful you deny me that

The salt in them is hot

Within me is a hell and there the poison

Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize

On unreprievable condemnd blood

O cousin thou art come to set mine eye

The tackle of my heart is cracked and burnt

And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail

Are turnd to one thread one little hair

My heart hath one poor string to stay it by

Which holds but till thy news be utterd

And then all this thou seest is but a clod

And module of confounded royalty
