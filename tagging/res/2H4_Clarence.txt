I shall observe him with all care and love.

He is not there today; he dines in London.

With Poins and other his continual followers.

O, my royal father!

No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs.

Th’ incessant care and labor of his mind

Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in

So thin that life looks through and will break out.

The river hath thrice flowed, no ebb between,

And the old folk, time’s doting chronicles,

Say it did so a little time before

That our great-grandsire, Edward, sicked and died.

His eye is hollow, and he changes much.

I am here, brother, full of heaviness.

Let us withdraw into the other room.

Doth the King call?

We left the Prince my brother here, my liege,

Who undertook to sit and watch by you.

Good morrow, cousin.

Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair,

Which swims against your stream of quality.

We hope no otherwise from your Majesty.
