


A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.

Not I.

I am not gamesome. I do lack some part

Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.

Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.

I’ll leave you.

Cassius,

Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look,

I turn the trouble of my countenance

Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am

Of late with passions of some difference,

Conceptions only proper to myself,

Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.

But let not therefore my good friends be grieved

(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)

Nor construe any further my neglect

Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,

Forgets the shows of love to other men.

No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself

But by reflection, by some other things.

Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,

That you would have me seek into myself

For that which is not in me?

What means this shouting? I do fear the people

Choose Caesar for their king.

I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.

But wherefore do you hold me here so long?

What is it that you would impart to me?

If it be aught toward the general good,

Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other

And I will look on both indifferently;

For let the gods so speed me as I love

The name of honor more than I fear death.

Another general shout!

I do believe that these applauses are

For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.

That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.

What you would work me to, I have some aim.

How I have thought of this, and of these times,

I shall recount hereafter. For this present,

I would not, so with love I might entreat you,

Be any further moved. What you have said

I will consider; what you have to say

I will with patience hear, and find a time

Both meet to hear and answer such high things.

Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:

Brutus had rather be a villager

Than to repute himself a son of Rome

Under these hard conditions as this time

Is like to lay upon us.

The games are done, and Caesar is returning.

I will do so. But look you, Cassius,

The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,

And all the rest look like a chidden train.

Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero

Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes

As we have seen him in the Capitol,

Being crossed in conference by some senators.

Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today

That Caesar looks so sad.

I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

What was the second noise for?

Was the crown offered him thrice?

Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness.

What said he when he came unto himself?

And, after that, he came thus sad away?

What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!

He was quick mettle when he went to school.

And so it is. For this time I will leave you.

Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,

I will come home to you; or, if you will,

Come home to me, and I will wait for you.

What, Lucius, ho!—

I cannot by the progress of the stars

Give guess how near to day.—Lucius, I say!—

I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.—

When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!

Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.

When it is lighted, come and call me here.

It must be by his death. And for my part

I know no personal cause to spurn at him,

But for the general. He would be crowned:

How that might change his nature, there’s the question.

It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,

And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,

And then I grant we put a sting in him

That at his will he may do danger with.

Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins

Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,

I have not known when his affections swayed

More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof

That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,

Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;

But, when he once attains the upmost round,

He then unto the ladder turns his back,

Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees

By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.

Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel

Will bear no color for the thing he is,

Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,

Would run to these and these extremities.

And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg,

Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,

And kill him in the shell.

Get you to bed again. It is not day.

Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

Look in the calendar, and bring me word.

The exhalations, whizzing in the air,

Give so much light that I may read by them.

Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake, and see thyself!

Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!

“Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake.”

Such instigations have been often dropped

Where I have took them up.

“Shall Rome, etc.” Thus must I piece it out:

Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome?

My ancestors did from the streets of Rome

The Tarquin drive when he was called a king.

“Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated

To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,

If the redress will follow, thou receivest

Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus.

’Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.

Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,

I have not slept.

Between the acting of a dreadful thing

And the first motion, all the interim is

Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.

The genius and the mortal instruments

Are then in council, and the state of man,

Like to a little kingdom, suffers then

The nature of an insurrection.

Is he alone?

Do you know them?

Let ’em enter.

They are the faction. O conspiracy,

Sham’st thou to show thy dang’rous brow by night,

When evils are most free? O, then, by day

Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough

To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy.

Hide it in smiles and affability;

For if thou path, thy native semblance on,

Not Erebus itself were dim enough

To hide thee from prevention.

I have been up this hour, awake all night.

Know I these men that come along with you?

He is welcome hither.

He is welcome too.

They are all welcome.

What watchful cares do interpose themselves

Betwixt your eyes and night?

Give me your hands all over, one by one.

No, not an oath. If not the face of men,

The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—

If these be motives weak, break off betimes,

And every man hence to his idle bed.

So let high-sighted tyranny range on

Till each man drop by lottery. But if these—

As I am sure they do—bear fire enough

To kindle cowards and to steel with valor

The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,

What need we any spur but our own cause

To prick us to redress? What other bond

Than secret Romans that have spoke the word

And will not palter? And what other oath

Than honesty to honesty engaged

That this shall be or we will fall for it?

Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,

Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls

That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear

Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain

The even virtue of our enterprise,

Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,

To think that or our cause or our performance

Did need an oath, when every drop of blood

That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,

Is guilty of a several bastardy

If he do break the smallest particle

Of any promise that hath passed from him.

O, name him not! Let us not break with him,

For he will never follow anything

That other men begin.

Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,

To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,

Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;

For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.

Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.

We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,

And in the spirit of men there is no blood.

O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit

And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,

Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,

Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.

Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,

Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.

And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,

Stir up their servants to an act of rage

And after seem to chide ’em. This shall make

Our purpose necessary and not envious;

Which so appearing to the common eyes,

We shall be called purgers, not murderers.

And for Mark Antony, think not of him,

For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm

When Caesar’s head is off.

Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.

If he love Caesar, all that he can do

Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.

And that were much he should, for he is given

To sports, to wildness, and much company.

Peace, count the clock.

By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?

Now, good Metellus, go along by him.

He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.

Send him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.

Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.

Let not our looks put on our purposes,

But bear it, as our Roman actors do,

With untired spirits and formal constancy.

And so good morrow to you every one.

Boy! Lucius!—Fast asleep? It is no matter.

Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.

Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies

Which busy care draws in the brains of men.

Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.

Portia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?

It is not for your health thus to commit

Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.

I am not well in health, and that is all.

Why so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.

Kneel not, gentle Portia.

You are my true and honorable wife,

As dear to me as are the ruddy drops

That visit my sad heart.

O you gods,

Render me worthy of this noble wife!

Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,

And by and by thy bosom shall partake

The secrets of my heart.

All my engagements I will construe to thee,

All the charactery of my sad brows.

Leave me with haste. Lucius, who ’s that knocks?

Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.—

Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?

O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,

To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!

Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,

Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

That must we also. What it is, my Caius,

I shall unfold to thee as we are going

To whom it must be done.

Follow me then.

Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.

That every like is not the same, O Caesar,

The heart of Brutus earns to think upon.

What said Popilius Lena?

Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.

Cassius, be constant.

Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,

For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

He is addressed. Press near and second him.

I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,

Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may

Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

People and Senators, be not affrighted.

Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid.

Where’s Publius?

Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer.

There is no harm intended to your person,

Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.

Do so, and let no man abide this deed

But we the doers.

Fates, we will know your pleasures.

That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time,

And drawing days out, that men stand upon.

Grant that, and then is death a benefit.

So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged

His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,

And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood

Up to the elbows and besmear our swords.

Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,

And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads,

Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”

How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,

That now on Pompey’s basis lies along

No worthier than the dust!

Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.

Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.

I never thought him worse.

Tell him, so please him come unto this place,

He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,

Depart untouched.

I know that we shall have him well to friend.

But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony!

O Antony, beg not your death of us!

Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,

As by our hands and this our present act

You see we do, yet see you but our hands

And this the bleeding business they have done.

Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;

And pity to the general wrong of Rome

(As fire drives out fire, so pity pity)

Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,

To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.

Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts

Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in

With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

Only be patient till we have appeased

The multitude, beside themselves with fear;

And then we will deliver you the cause

Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,

Have thus proceeded.

Or else were this a savage spectacle.

Our reasons are so full of good regard

That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,

You should be satisfied.

You shall, Mark Antony.

By your pardon,

I will myself into the pulpit first

And show the reason of our Caesar’s death.

What Antony shall speak I will protest

He speaks by leave and by permission,

And that we are contented Caesar shall

Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.

It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.

You shall not in your funeral speech blame us

But speak all good you can devise of Caesar

And say you do ’t by our permission,

Else shall you not have any hand at all

About his funeral. And you shall speak

In the same pulpit whereto I am going,

After my speech is ended.

Prepare the body, then, and follow us.

Then follow me and give me audience, friends.—

Cassius, go you into the other street

And part the numbers.—

Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;

Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;

And public reasons shall be renderèd

Of Caesar’s death.

Be patient till the last.

Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my

cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me

for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor

that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom,

and awake your senses that you may the better

judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear

friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love

to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend

demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my

answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved

Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and

die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all

freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he

was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I

honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.

There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor

for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is

here so base that would be a bondman? If any,

speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude

that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him

have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not

love his country? If any, speak, for him have I

offended. I pause for a reply.

Then none have I offended. I have done no

more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The

question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his

glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor

his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.

Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,

who, though he had no hand in his death, shall

receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the

commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With

this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the

good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself

when it shall please my country to need my death.

My countrymen—

Good countrymen, let me depart alone,

And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.

Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech

Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony

(By our permission) is allowed to make.

I do entreat you, not a man depart,

Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.

Stand ho!

What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?

He greets me well.—Your master, Pindarus,

In his own change or by ill officers,

Hath given me some worthy cause to wish

Things done undone, but if he be at hand

I shall be satisfied.

He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,

How he received you. Let me be resolved.

Thou hast described

A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,

When love begins to sicken and decay

It useth an enforcèd ceremony.

There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;

But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,

Make gallant show and promise of their mettle,

But when they should endure the bloody spur,

They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades,

Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?

Hark, he is arrived.

March gently on to meet him.

Stand ho! Speak the word along.

Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?

And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

Cassius, be content.

Speak your griefs softly. I do know you well.

Before the eyes of both our armies here

(Which should perceive nothing but love from us),

Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away.

Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,

And I will give you audience.

Lucius, do you the like, and let no man

Come to our tent till we have done our conference.

Let Lucilius and Titinius guard our door.

You wronged yourself to write in such a case.

Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself

Are much condemned to have an itching palm,

To sell and mart your offices for gold

To undeservers.

The name of Cassius honors this corruption,

And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

Remember March; the ides of March remember.

Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?

What villain touched his body that did stab

And not for justice? What, shall one of us

That struck the foremost man of all this world

But for supporting robbers, shall we now

Contaminate our fingers with base bribes

And sell the mighty space of our large honors

For so much trash as may be graspèd thus?

I had rather be a dog and bay the moon

Than such a Roman.

Go to! You are not, Cassius.

I say you are not.

Away, slight man!

Hear me, for I will speak.

Must I give way and room to your rash choler?

Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.

Go show your slaves how choleric you are

And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?

Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch

Under your testy humor? By the gods,

You shall digest the venom of your spleen

Though it do split you. For, from this day forth,

I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,

When you are waspish.

You say you are a better soldier.

Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,

And it shall please me well. For mine own part,

I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

If you did, I care not.

Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.

No.

For your life you durst not.

You have done that you should be sorry for.

There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,

For I am armed so strong in honesty

That they pass by me as the idle wind,

Which I respect not. I did send to you

For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,

For I can raise no money by vile means.

By heaven, I had rather coin my heart

And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring

From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash

By any indirection. I did send

To you for gold to pay my legions,

Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?

Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?

When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous

To lock such rascal counters from his friends,

Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;

Dash him to pieces!

You did.

I do not, till you practice them on me.

I do not like your faults.

A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear

As huge as high Olympus.

Sheathe your dagger.

Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.

Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.

O Cassius, you are yokèd with a lamb

That carries anger as the flint bears fire,

Who, much enforcèd, shows a hasty spark

And straight is cold again.

When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.

And my heart too.

What’s the matter?

Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth

When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,

He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence!

I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.

What should the wars do with these jigging fools?—

Companion, hence!

Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders

Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.

Lucius, a bowl of wine.

O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.

She is dead.

Impatient of my absence,

And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony

Have made themselves so strong—for with her death

That tidings came—with this she fell distract

And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.

Even so.

Speak no more of her.—Give me a bowl of wine.—

In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala.

Now sit we close about this taper here,

And call in question our necessities.

No more, I pray you.—

Messala, I have here receivèd letters

That young Octavius and Mark Antony

Come down upon us with a mighty power,

Bending their expedition toward Philippi.

With what addition?

Therein our letters do not well agree.

Mine speak of seventy senators that died

By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

No, Messala.

Nothing, Messala.

Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?

Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.

With meditating that she must die once,

I have the patience to endure it now.

Well, to our work alive. What do you think

Of marching to Philippi presently?

Your reason?

Good reasons must of force give place to better.

The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground

Do stand but in a forced affection,

For they have grudged us contribution.

The enemy, marching along by them,

By them shall make a fuller number up,

Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged,

From which advantage shall we cut him off

If at Philippi we do face him there,

These people at our back.

Under your pardon. You must note besides

That we have tried the utmost of our friends,

Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe.

The enemy increaseth every day;

We, at the height, are ready to decline.

There is a tide in the affairs of men

Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;

Omitted, all the voyage of their life

Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

On such a full sea are we now afloat,

And we must take the current when it serves

Or lose our ventures.

The deep of night is crept upon our talk,

And nature must obey necessity,

Which we will niggard with a little rest.

There is no more to say.

Lucius.    My gown. Farewell, good Messala.—

Good night, Titinius.—Noble, noble Cassius,

Good night and good repose.

Everything is well.

Good night, good brother.

Farewell, everyone.

Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

What, thou speak’st drowsily?

Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o’erwatched.

Call Claudius and some other of my men;

I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.

It may be I shall raise you by and by

On business to my brother Cassius.

I will not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.

It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.

Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so.

I put it in the pocket of my gown.

Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.

Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile

And touch thy instrument a strain or two?

It does, my boy.

I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

I should not urge thy duty past thy might.

I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.

I will not hold thee long. If I do live,

I will be good to thee.

This is a sleepy tune. O murd’rous slumber,

Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,

That plays thee music?—Gentle knave, good night.

I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.

If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument.

I’ll take it from thee and, good boy, good night.

Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turned down

Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.

How ill this taper burns.    Ha, who comes here?—

I think it is the weakness of mine eyes

That shapes this monstrous apparition.

It comes upon me.—Art thou any thing?

Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,

That mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare?

Speak to me what thou art.

Why com’st thou?

Well, then I shall see thee again?

Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.

Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest.

Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.—

Boy, Lucius!—Varro, Claudius, sirs, awake!

Claudius!

He thinks he still is at his instrument.

Lucius, awake!

Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?

Sleep again, Lucius.—Sirrah Claudius!

Fellow thou, awake!

Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

Ay. Saw you anything?

Go and commend me to my brother Cassius.

Bid him set on his powers betimes before,

And we will follow.

They stand and would have parley.

Words before blows; is it so, countrymen?

Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

O yes, and soundless too,

For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony,

And very wisely threat before you sting.

Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands

Unless thou bring’st them with thee.

O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,

Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.

Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you.

Even so, Lucilius.

Even by the rule of that philosophy

By which I did blame Cato for the death

Which he did give himself (I know not how,

But I do find it cowardly and vile,

For fear of what might fall, so to prevent

The time of life), arming myself with patience

To stay the providence of some high powers

That govern us below.

No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,

That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.

He bears too great a mind. But this same day

Must end that work the ides of March begun.

And whether we shall meet again, I know not.

Therefore our everlasting farewell take.

Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.

If we do meet again, why we shall smile;

If not, why then this parting was well made.

Why then, lead on.—O, that a man might know

The end of this day’s business ere it come!

But it sufficeth that the day will end,

And then the end is known.—Come ho, away!

Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills

Unto the legions on the other side!

Let them set on at once, for I perceive

But cold demeanor in Octavius’ wing,

And sudden push gives them the overthrow.

Ride, ride, Messala! Let them all come down.

Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?

Titinius’ face is upward.

O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet;

Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords

In our own proper entrails.

Are yet two Romans living such as these?—

The last of all the Romans, fare thee well.

It is impossible that ever Rome

Should breed thy fellow.—Friends, I owe more tears

To this dead man than you shall see me pay.—

I shall find time, Cassius; I shall find time.—

Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body.

His funerals shall not be in our camp,

Lest it discomfort us.—Lucilius, come.—

And come, young Cato. Let us to the field.—

Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on.

’Tis three o’clock, and, Romans, yet ere night

We shall try fortune in a second fight.

Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!

Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.

Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word;

It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.

Peace, then, no words.

Hark thee, Dardanus.

Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word.

Why this, Volumnius:

The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me

Two several times by night—at Sardis once

And this last night here in Philippi fields.

I know my hour is come.

Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.

Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.

Our enemies have beat us to the pit.

It is more worthy to leap in ourselves

Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,

Thou know’st that we two went to school together;

Even for that our love of old, I prithee,

Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it.

Farewell to you—and you—and you, Volumnius.—

Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.

Farewell to thee, too, Strato.—Countrymen,

My heart doth joy that yet in all my life

I found no man but he was true to me.

I shall have glory by this losing day

More than Octavius and Mark Antony

By this vile conquest shall attain unto.

So fare you well at once, for Brutus’ tongue

Hath almost ended his life’s history.

Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,

That have but labored to attain this hour.

Hence. I will follow.

I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.

Thou art a fellow of a good respect;

Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.

Hold, then, my sword, and turn away thy face

While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?

Farewell, good Strato.  Caesar, now be still.

I killed not thee with half so good a will.
