
The Duke does greet you general

And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance

Even on the instant

Something from Cyprus as I may divine

It is a business of some heat The galleys

Have sent a dozen sequent messengers

This very night at one another's heels

And many of the Consuls raised and met

Are at the Duke's already You have been hotly called for

When being not at your lodging to be found

The Senate hath sent about three several quests

To search you out

Ancient what makes he here

I do not understand

To who

Here comes another troop to seek for you

Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle

That so approve the Moor O let the heavens

Give him defense against the elements

For I have lost him on a dangerous sea

His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot

Of very expert and approved allowance

Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death

Stand in bold cure

What noise

My hopes do shape him for the Governor

I pray you sir go forth

And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived

Most fortunately He hath achieved a maid

That paragons description and wild fame

One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens

And in th' essential vesture of creation

Does tire the ingener    How now Who has put in

'Has had most favorable and happy speed

Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds

The guttered rocks and congregated sands

Traitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keel

As having sense of beauty do omit

Their mortal natures letting go safely by

The divine Desdemona

She that I spake of our great captain's captain

Left in the conduct of the bold Iago

Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts

A sennight's speed Great Jove Othello guard

And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath

That he may bless this bay with his tall ship

Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms

Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits

And bring all Cyprus comfort    O behold

The riches of the ship is come on shore

You men of Cyprus let her have your knees

Hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven

Before behind thee and on every hand

Enwheel thee round

He is not yet arrived nor know I aught

But that he's well and will be shortly here

The great contention of sea and skies

Parted our fellowship  But hark a sail

See for the news

Good ancient you are welcome Welcome mistress

Let it not gall your patience good Iago

That I extend my manners 'Tis my breeding

That gives me this bold show of courtesy

He speaks home madam You may relish him

more in the soldier than in the scholar

'Tis truly so

Lo where he comes

Iago hath direction what to do

But notwithstanding with my personal eye

Will I look to 't

Welcome Iago We must to the watch

She's a most exquisite lady

Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate

creature

An inviting eye and yet methinks right

modest

She is indeed perfection

Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and

unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish

courtesy would invent some other custom of

entertainment

I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was

craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it

makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity and

dare not task my weakness with any more

Where are they

I'll do 't but it dislikes me

'Fore God they have given me a rouse

already

'Fore God an excellent song

Is your Englishman so exquisite in his

drinking

To the health of our general

'Fore God this is a more exquisite song than

the other

No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place

that does those things Well God's above all and

there be souls must be saved and there be souls

must not be saved

For mine own partno offense to the General

nor any man of qualityI hope to be saved

Ay but by your leave not before me The

Lieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient Let's

have no more of this Let's to our affairs God

forgive us our sins Gentlemen let's look to our

business Do not think gentlemen I am drunk This

is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my

left I am not drunk now I can stand well enough

and I speak well enough

Why very well then You must not think then

that I am drunk

Zounds you rogue you rascal

A knave teach me my duty I'll beat the knave

into a twiggen bottle

Dost thou prate rogue

Let me go sir or I'll knock you o'er the

mazard

Drunk

I pray you pardon me I cannot speak

Ay past all surgery

Reputation reputation reputation O I have

lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of

myself and what remains is bestial My reputation

Iago my reputation

I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive

so good a commander with so slight so drunken

and so indiscreet an officer Drunk And speak

parrot And squabble Swagger Swear And discourse

fustian with one's own shadow O thou

invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be

known by let us call thee devil

I know not

I remember a mass of things but nothing

distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O

God that men should put an enemy in their

mouths to steal away their brains That we should

with joy pleasance revel and applause transform

ourselves into beasts

It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give

place to the devil wrath One unperfectness shows

me another to make me frankly despise myself

I will ask him for my place again he shall tell

me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as

Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be

now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently

a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblessed

and the ingredient is a devil

I have well approved it sirI drunk

You advise me well

I think it freely and betimes in the morning I

will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake

for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check

me here

Good night honest Iago

Masters play here I will content your pains

Something that's brief and bid Good morrow general

Dost thou hear mine honest friend

Prithee keep up thy quillets

There's a poor piece of gold for thee If the gentlewoman

that attends the General's wife be stirring

tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor

of speech Wilt thou do this

Do good my friend    In happy time Iago

Why no The day had broke

Before we parted I have made bold Iago

To send in to your wife My suit to her

Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona

Procure me some access

I humbly thank you for 't I never knew

A Florentine more kind and honest

Yet I beseech you

If you think fit or that it may be done

Give me advantage of some brief discourse

With Desdemon alone

I am much bound to you

Bounteous madam

Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio

He's never anything but your true servant

Ay but lady

That policy may either last so long

Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet

Or breed itself so out of circumstance

That I being absent and my place supplied

My general will forget my love and service

Madam I'll take my leave

Madam not now I am very ill at ease

Unfit for mine own purposes

Madam my former suit I do beseech you

That by your virtuous means I may again

Exist and be a member of his love

Whom I with all the office of my heart

Entirely honor I would not be delayed

If my offense be of such mortal kind

That nor my service past nor present sorrows

Nor purposed merit in futurity

Can ransom me into his love again

But to know so must be my benefit

So shall I clothe me in a forced content

And shut myself up in some other course

To fortune's alms

I humbly thank your Ladyship

What make you from home

How is 't with you my most fair Bianca

I' faith sweet love I was coming to your house

Pardon me Bianca

I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed

But I shall in a more continuate time

Strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca

Take me this work out

Go to woman

Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth

From whence you have them You are jealous now

That this is from some mistress some remembrance

No by my faith Bianca

I know not neither I found it in my chamber

I like the work well Ere it be demanded

As like enough it will I would have it copied

Take it and do 't and leave me for this time

I do attend here on the General

And think it no addition nor my wish

To have him see me womaned

Not that I love you not

'Tis but a little way that I can bring you

For I attend here But I'll see you soon

What's the matter

Rub him about the temples

The worser that you give me the addition

Whose want even kills me

Alas poor caitiff

Alas poor rogue I think i' faith she loves me

Ha ha ha

I marry her What a customer Prithee bear

some charity to my wit Do not think it so unwholesome

Ha ha ha

Prithee say true

This is the monkey's own giving out She is

persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and

flattery not out of my promise

She was here even now She haunts me in

every place I was the other day talking on the

sea-bank with certain Venetians and thither comes

the bauble By this hand she falls thus about my

neck

So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so

shakes and pulls me Ha ha ha

Well I must leave her company

'Tis such another fitchewmarry a perfumed

oneWhat do you mean by this haunting

of me

How now my sweet Bianca How now How now

Faith I must She'll rail in the streets else

Faith I intend so

Prithee come Will you

That thrust had been mine enemy indeed

But that my coat is better than thou know'st

I will make proof of thine

I am maimed forever Help ho Murder murder

O help ho Light A surgeon

What ho No watch No passage Murder murder

O help

Here here For heaven's sake help me

Iago O I am spoiled undone by villains

Give me some help

I think that one of them is hereabout

And cannot make away

That's one of them

My leg is cut in two

No

None in the world Nor do I know the man

O heavens forfend

Dear general I never gave you cause

Most heathenish and most gross

I found it in my chamber

And he himself confessed it but even now

That there he dropped it for a special purpose

Which wrought to his desire

There is besides in Roderigo's letter

How he upbraids Iago that he made him

Brave me upon the watch whereon it came

That I was cast And even but now he spake

After long seeming dead Iago hurt him

Iago set him on

This did I fear but thought he had no weapon

For he was great of heart
