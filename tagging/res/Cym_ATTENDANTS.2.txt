
But what's the matter

None but the King

And why so

You speak him far

What's his name and birth

I honor him

Even out of your report But pray you tell me

Is she sole child to th' King

How long is this ago

That a king's children should be so conveyed

So slackly guarded and the search so slow

That could not trace them

I do well believe you
