


We may sir if we will

Think you so Which way do you

judge my wit would fly

Why that way

You are never without your tricks You

may you may

Content content

Your own desert

You shall ha 't worthy sir

An 'twere to give againbut 'tis no

matter

Amen sir To my poor unworthy notice

He mocked us when he begged our voices

Not one amongst us save yourself but says

He used us scornfully He should have showed us

His marks of merit wounds received for 's country

No no No man saw 'em

And will deny him

I'll have five hundred voices of that sound

We will so Almost all

Repent in their election
