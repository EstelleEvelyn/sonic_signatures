Do not say so

Madam he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence

We met him thitherward for thence we came

And after some dispatch in hand at court

Thither we bend again

Ay madam

And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains

Ay madam

Such is his noble purpose and believe 't

The Duke will lay upon him all the honor

That good convenience claims

We serve you madam

In that and all your worthiest affairs
