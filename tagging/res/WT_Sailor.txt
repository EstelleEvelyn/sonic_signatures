
Ay, my lord, and fear

We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly

And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,

The heavens with that we have in hand are angry

And frown upon ’s.

Make your best haste, and go not

Too far i’ th’ land. ’Tis like to be loud weather.

Besides, this place is famous for the creatures

Of prey that keep upon ’t.

I am glad at heart

To be so rid o’ th’ business.
