


Thou ominous and fearful owl of death

Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge

The period of thy tyranny approacheth

On us thou canst not enter but by death

For I protest we are well fortified

And strong enough to issue out and fight

If thou retire the Dauphin well appointed

Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee

On either hand thee there are squadrons pitched

To wall thee from the liberty of flight

And no way canst thou turn thee for redress

But Death doth front thee with apparent spoil

And pale Destruction meets thee in the face

Ten thousand French have ta'en the Sacrament

To rive their dangerous artillery

Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot

Lo there thou stand'st a breathing valiant man

Of an invincible unconquered spirit

This is the latest glory of thy praise

That I thy enemy due thee withal

For ere the glass that now begins to run

Finish the process of his sandy hour

These eyes that see thee now well-colord

Shall see thee withered bloody pale and dead

Hark hark the Dauphin's drum a warning bell

Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul

And mine shall ring thy dire departure out
