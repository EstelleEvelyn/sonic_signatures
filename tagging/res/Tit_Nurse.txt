O tell me did you see Aaron the Moor

O gentle Aaron we are all undone

Now help or woe betide thee evermore

O that which I would hide from heaven's eye

Our empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace

She is delivered lords she is delivered

I mean she is brought abed

A devil

A joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue

Here is the babe as loathsome as a toad

Amongst the fair-faced breeders of our clime

The Empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal

And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point

Aaron it must The mother wills it so

The Emperor in his rage will doom her death

Aaron what shall I say unto the Empress

Cornelia the midwife and myself

And no one else but the delivered Empress
