Beware the ides of March.

Beware the ides of March.

At mine own house, good lady.

About the ninth hour, lady.

Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand

To see him pass on to the Capitol.

That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar

To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,

I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.

Good morrow to you.—Here the street is narrow.

The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,

Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,

Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.

I’ll get me to a place more void, and there

Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
