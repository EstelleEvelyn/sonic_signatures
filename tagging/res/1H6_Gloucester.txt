


England ne'er had a king until his time

Virtue he had deserving to command

His brandished sword did blind men with his beams

His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings

His sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire

More dazzled and drove back his enemies

Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces

What should I say His deeds exceed all speech

He ne'er lift up his hand but conquerd

The Church Where is it Had not churchmen prayed

His thread of life had not so soon decayed

None do you like but an effeminate prince

Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe

Name not religion for thou lov'st the flesh

And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st

Except it be to pray against thy foes

Is Paris lost Is Roan yielded up

If Henry were recalled to life again

These news would cause him once more yield the ghost

We will not fly but to our enemies' throats

Bedford if thou be slack I'll fight it out

I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can

To view th' artillery and munition

And then I will proclaim young Henry king

I am come to survey the Tower this day

Since Henry's death I fear there is conveyance

Where be these warders that they wait not here

Open the gates 'Tis Gloucester that calls

Who willed you Or whose will stands but mine

There's none Protector of the realm but I

Break up the gates I'll be your warrantize

Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms

Lieutenant is it you whose voice I hear

Open the gates Here's Gloucester that would enter

Fainthearted Woodville prizest him 'fore me

Arrogant Winchester that haughty prelate

Whom Henry our late sovereign ne'er could brook

Thou art no friend to God or to the King

Open the gates or I'll shut thee out shortly

Peeled priest dost thou command me to be shut out

Stand back thou manifest conspirator

Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord

Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin

I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat

If thou proceed in this thy insolence

I will not slay thee but I'll drive thee back

Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth

I'll use to carry thee out of this place

What am I dared and bearded to my face

Draw men for all this privilegd place

Blue coats to tawny coats Priest beware your beard

I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly

Under my feet I'll stamp thy cardinal's hat

In spite of pope or dignities of Church

Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down

Winchester goose I cry a rope a rope

Now beat them hence why do you let them stay

Thee I'll chase hence thou wolf in sheep's array

Out tawny coats out scarlet hypocrite

Peace Mayor Thou know'st little of my wrongs

Here's Beaufort that regards nor God nor king

Hath here distrained the Tower to his use

I will not answer thee with words but blows

Cardinal I'll be no breaker of the law

But we shall meet and break our minds at large

Mayor farewell Thou dost but what thou mayst

Presumptuous priest this place commands my patience

Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonored me

Think not although in writing I preferred

The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes

That therefore I have forged or am not able

Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen

No prelate such is thy audacious wickedness

Thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks

As very infants prattle of thy pride

Thou art a most pernicious usurer

Froward by nature enemy to peace

Lascivious wanton more than well beseems

A man of thy profession and degree

And for thy treachery what's more manifest

In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life

As well at London Bridge as at the Tower

Besides I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted

The King thy sovereign is not quite exempt

From envious malice of thy swelling heart

As good

Thou bastard of my grandfather

Am I not Protector saucy priest

Yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps

And useth it to patronage his theft

Thou art reverend

Touching thy spiritual function not thy life

Roam thither then

You of my household leave this peevish broil

And set this unaccustomed fight aside

Stay stay I say

And if you love me as you say you do

Let me persuade you to forbear awhile

Compassion on the King commands me stoop

Or I would see his heart out ere the priest

Should ever get that privilege of me

Here Winchester I offer thee my hand

Ay but I fear me with a hollow heart

See here my friends and loving countrymen

This token serveth for a flag of truce

Betwixt ourselves and all our followers

So help me God as I dissemble not

Well urged my Lord of WarwickFor sweet prince

An if your Grace mark every circumstance

You have great reason to do Richard right

Especially for those occasions

At Eltham Place I told your Majesty

Welcome high prince the mighty Duke of York

Now will it best avail your Majesty

To cross the seas and to be crowned in France

The presence of a king engenders love

Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends

As it disanimates his enemies

Your ships already are in readiness

Yes if it please your Majesty my liege

Lord Bishop set the crown upon his head

Now Governor of Paris take your oath

That you elect no other king but him

Esteem none friends but such as are his friends

And none your foes but such as shall pretend

Malicious practices against his state

This shall you do so help you righteous God

To say the truth this fact was infamous

And ill beseeming any common man

Much more a knight a captain and a leader

What means his Grace that he hath changed his style

No more but plain and bluntly To the King

Hath he forgot he is his sovereign

Or doth this churlish superscription

Pretend some alteration in good will

What's here I have upon especial cause

Moved with compassion of my country's wrack

Together with the pitiful complaints

Of such as your oppression feeds upon

Forsaken your pernicious faction

And joined with Charles the rightful king of France

O monstrous treachery Can this be so

That in alliance amity and oaths

There should be found such false dissembling guile

He doth my lord and is become your foe

It is the worst and all my lord he writes

Confirm it so Confounded be your strife

And perish you with your audacious prate

Presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed

With this immodest clamorous outrage

To trouble and disturb the King and us

And you my lords methinks you do not well

To bear with their perverse objections

Much less to take occasion from their mouths

To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves

Let me persuade you take a better course

I have my lord and their intent is this

They humbly sue unto your Excellence

To have a godly peace concluded of

Between the realms of England and of France

Well my good lord and as the only means

To stop effusion of our Christian blood

And stablish quietness on every side

Besides my lord the sooner to effect

And surer bind this knot of amity

The Earl of Armagnac near knit to Charles

A man of great authority in France

Proffers his only daughter to your Grace

In marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry

And for the proffer of my lord your master

I have informed his Highness so at large

As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts

Her beauty and the value of her dower

He doth intend she shall be England's queen

So should I give consent to flatter sin

You know my lord your Highness is betrothed

Unto another lady of esteem

How shall we then dispense with that contract

And not deface your honor with reproach

Why what I pray is Margaret more than that

Her father is no better than an earl

Although in glorious titles he excel

And so the Earl of Armagnac may do

Because he is near kinsman unto Charles

Ay grief I fear me both at first and last
