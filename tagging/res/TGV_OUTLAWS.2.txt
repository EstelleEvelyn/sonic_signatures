


If there be ten shrink not but down with 'em

Peace We'll hear him

Whither travel you

For what offense

Have you the tongues

Tell us this have you anything to take to

And I from Mantua for a gentleman

Who in my mood I stabbed unto the heart

Indeed because you are a banished man

Therefore above the rest we parley to you

Are you content to be our general

To make a virtue of necessity

And live as we do in this wilderness

Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered

Come bring her away

A prize a prize a prize
