Search the market narrowly Mytilene is full

of gallants We lost too much money this mart by

being too wenchless

Therefore let's have fresh ones whate'er we

pay for them If there be not a conscience to be

used in every trade we shall never prosper

Thou sayst true There's two unwholesome a'

conscience The poor Transylvanian is dead that

lay with the little baggage

Three or four thousand chequins were as

pretty a proportion to live quietly and so give over

O our credit comes not in like the commodity

nor the commodity wages not with the danger

Therefore if in our youths we could pick up some

pretty estate 'twere not amiss to keep our door

hatched Besides the sore terms we stand upon

with the gods will be strong with us for giving o'er

As well as we Ay and better too we offend

worse Neither is our profession any trade it's no

calling But here comes Bolt

Well follow me my masters you shall have

your money presentlyWife take her in Instruct

her what she has to do that she may not be raw in

her entertainment

Well I had rather than twice the worth of her

she had ne'er come here

Now the pox upon her greensickness for me
