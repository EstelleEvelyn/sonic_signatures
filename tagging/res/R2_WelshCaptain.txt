And hardly kept our countrymen together

And yet we hear no tidings from the King

Therefore we will disperse ourselves Farewell

'Tis thought the King is dead We will not stay

The bay trees in our country are all withered

And meteors fright the fixd stars of heaven

The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the Earth

And lean-looked prophets whisper fearful change

Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap

The one in fear to lose what they enjoy

The other to enjoy by rage and war

These signs forerun the death or fall of kings

Farewell Our countrymen are gone and fled

As well assured Richard their king is dead
