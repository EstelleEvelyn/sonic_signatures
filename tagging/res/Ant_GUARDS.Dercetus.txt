
Alas, and woe!

Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.

This sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings

Shall enter me with him.

There, Diomed, there.

I am called Dercetus.

Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy

Best to be served. Whilst he stood up and spoke,

He was my master, and I wore my life

To spend upon his haters. If thou please

To take me to thee, as I was to him

I’ll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,

I yield thee up my life.

I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

He is dead, Caesar,

Not by a public minister of justice,

Nor by a hirèd knife, but that self hand

Which writ his honor in the acts it did

Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,

Splitted the heart. This is his sword.

I robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained

With his most noble blood.

Dolabella!
