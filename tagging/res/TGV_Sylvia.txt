


Sir Valentine and servant to you two

thousand

I thank you gentle servant 'tis very clerkly done

Perchance you think too much of so much pains

A pretty period Well I guess the sequel

And yet I will not name it And yet I care not

And yet take this again And yet I thank you

Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more

Yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ

But since unwillingly take them again

Nay take them

Ay ay You writ them sir at my request

But I will none of them They are for you

I would have had them writ more movingly

And when it's writ for my sake read it over

And if it please you so if not why so

Why if it please you take it for your labor

And so good-morrow servant

Servant

Servant you are sad

What angry Sir Thurio Do you change color

A fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly

shot off

Who is that servant

No more gentlemen no more Here comes my father

Belike that now she hath enfranchised them

Upon some other pawn for fealty

Nay then he should be blind and being blind

How could he see his way to seek out you

Have done have done Here comes the gentleman

His worth is warrant for his welcome hither

If this be he you oft have wished to hear from

Too low a mistress for so high a servant

And duty never yet did want his meed

Servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress

That you are welcome

I wait upon his pleasure Come Sir Thurio

Go with meOnce more new servant welcome

I'll leave you to confer of home affairs

When you have done we look to hear from you

I thank you for your music gentlemen

Who is that that spake

Sir Proteus as I take it

What's your will

You have your wish my will is even this

That presently you hie you home to bed

Thou subtle perjured false disloyal man

Think'st thou I am so shallow so conceitless

To be seducd by thy flattery

That hast deceived so many with thy vows

Return return and make thy love amends

For me by this pale queen of night I swear

I am so far from granting thy request

That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit

And by and by intend to chide myself

Even for this time I spend in talking to thee

Say that she be yet Valentine thy friend

Survives to whom thyself art witness

I am betrothed And art thou not ashamed

To wrong him with thy importunacy

And so suppose am I for in his grave

Assure thyself my love is burid

Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence

Or at the least in hers sepulcher thine

I am very loath to be your idol sir

But since your falsehood shall become you well

To worship shadows and adore false shapes

Send to me in the morning and I'll send it

And so good rest

Who calls

Sir Eglamour a thousand times good morrow

O Eglamour thou art a gentleman

Think not I flatter for I swear I do not

Valiant wise remorseful well accomplished

Thou art not ignorant what dear good will

I bear unto the banished Valentine

Nor how my father would enforce me marry

Vain Thurio whom my very soul abhorred

Thyself hast loved and I have heard thee say

No grief did ever come so near thy heart

As when thy lady and thy true love died

Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity

Sir Eglamour I would to Valentine

To Mantua where I hear he makes abode

And for the ways are dangerous to pass

I do desire thy worthy company

Upon whose faith and honor I repose

Urge not my father's anger Eglamour

But think upon my grief a lady's grief

And on the justice of my flying hence

To keep me from a most unholy match

Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues

I do desire thee even from a heart

As full of sorrows as the sea of sands

To bear me company and go with me

If not to hide what I have said to thee

That I may venture to depart alone

This evening coming

At Friar Patrick's cell

Where I intend holy confession

Good morrow kind Sir Eglamour

What would you with her if that I be she

From whom

O he sends you for a picture

Ursula bring my picture there

Go give your master this Tell him from me

One Julia that his changing thoughts forget

Would better fit his chamber than this shadow

I pray thee let me look on that again

There hold

I will not look upon your master's lines

I know they are stuffed with protestations

And full of new-found oaths which he will break

As easily as I do tear his paper

The more shame for him that he sends it me

For I have heard him say a thousand times

His Julia gave it him at his departure

Though his false finger have profaned the ring

Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong

What sayst thou

Dost thou know her

Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her

Is she not passing fair

How tall was she

She is beholding to thee gentle youth

Alas poor lady desolate and left

I weep myself to think upon thy words

Here youth there is my purse  I give thee this

For thy sweet mistress' sake because thou lov'st her

Farewell

Amen amen Go on good Eglamour

Out at the postern by the abbey wall

I fear I am attended by some spies

A thousand more mischances than this one

Have learned me how to brook this patiently

O Valentine this I endure for thee

O miserable unhappy that I am

By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy

Had I been seizd by a hungry lion

I would have been a breakfast to the beast

Rather than have false Proteus rescue me

O heaven be judge how I love Valentine

Whose life's as tender to me as my soul

And full as much for more there cannot be

I do detest false perjured Proteus

Therefore begone solicit me no more

When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved

Read over Julia's heart thy first best love

For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith

Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths

Descended into perjury to love me

Thou hast no faith left now unless thou 'dst two

And that's far worse than none better have none

Than plural faith which is too much by one

Thou counterfeit to thy true friend

All men but Proteus

O heaven
