Bear me to prison where I am committed

Thus can the demigod Authority

Make us pay down for our offense by weight

The words of heaven on whom it will it will

On whom it will not so yet still 'tis just

From too much liberty my Lucio liberty

As surfeit is the father of much fast

So every scope by the immoderate use

Turns to restraint Our natures do pursue

Like rats that raven down their proper bane

A thirsty evil and when we drink we die

What but to speak of would offend again

No

Call it so

One word good friendLucio a word with you

Thus stands it with me upon a true contract

I got possession of Julietta's bed

You know the lady She is fast my wife

Save that we do the denunciation lack

Of outward order This we came not to

Only for propagation of a dower

Remaining in the coffer of her friends

From whom we thought it meet to hide our love

Till time had made them for us But it chances

The stealth of our most mutual entertainment

With character too gross is writ on Juliet

Unhappily even so

And the new deputy now for the Duke

Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness

Or whether that the body public be

A horse whereon the governor doth ride

Who newly in the seat that it may know

He can command lets it straight feel the spur

Whether the tyranny be in his place

Or in his eminence that fills it up

I stagger inbut this new governor

Awakes me all the enrolld penalties

Which have like unscoured armor hung by th' wall

So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round

And none of them been worn and for a name

Now puts the drowsy and neglected act

Freshly on me 'Tis surely for a name

I have done so but he's not to be found

I prithee Lucio do me this kind service

This day my sister should the cloister enter

And there receive her approbation

Acquaint her with the danger of my state

Implore her in my voice that she make friends

To the strict deputy bid herself assay him

I have great hope in that for in her youth

There is a prone and speechless dialect

Such as move men Besides she hath prosperous art

When she will play with reason and discourse

And well she can persuade

I thank you good friend Lucio

Come officer away

The miserable have no other medicine

But only hope

I have hope to live and am prepared to die

I humbly thank you

To sue to live I find I seek to die

And seeking death find life Let it come on

Most holy sir I thank you

Now sister what's the comfort

Is there no remedy

But is there any

Perpetual durance

But in what nature

Let me know the point

Why give you me this shame

Think you I can a resolution fetch

From flowery tenderness If I must die

I will encounter darkness as a bride

And hug it in mine arms

The prenzie Angelo

O heavens it cannot be

Thou shalt not do 't

Thanks dear Isabel

Yes Has he affections in him

That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose

When he would force it Sure it is no sin

Or of the deadly seven it is the least

If it were damnable he being so wise

Why would he for the momentary trick

Be perdurably fined O Isabel

Death is a fearful thing

Ay but to die and go we know not where

To lie in cold obstruction and to rot

This sensible warm motion to become

A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit

To bathe in fiery floods or to reside

In thrilling region of thick-ribbd ice

To be imprisoned in the viewless winds

And blown with restless violence round about

The pendent world or to be worse than worst

Of those that lawless and incertain thought

Imagine howling'tis too horrible

The weariest and most loathd worldly life

That age ache penury and imprisonment

Can lay on nature is a paradise

To what we fear of death

Sweet sister let me live

What sin you do to save a brother's life

Nature dispenses with the deed so far

That it becomes a virtue

Nay hear me Isabel

O hear me Isabella

Let me ask my sister pardon I am so out of

love with life that I will sue to be rid of it

As fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labor

When it lies starkly in the traveler's bones

He will not wake
