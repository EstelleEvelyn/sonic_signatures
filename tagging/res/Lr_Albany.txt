


Dear sir forbear

Pray sir be patient

My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant

Of what hath moved you

Now gods that we adore whereof comes this

What's the matter sir

I cannot be so partial Goneril

To the great love I bear you

Well you may fear too far

How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell

Striving to better oft we mar what's well

Well well th' event

O Goneril

You are not worth the dust which the rude wind

Blows in your face I fear your disposition

That nature which contemns its origin

Cannot be bordered certain in itself

She that herself will sliver and disbranch

From her material sap perforce must wither

And come to deadly use

Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile

Filths savor but themselves What have you done

Tigers not daughters what have you performed

A father and a gracious agd man

Whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick

Most barbarous most degenerate have you madded

Could my good brother suffer you to do it

A man a prince by him so benefited

If that the heavens do not their visible spirits

Send quickly down to tame these vile offenses

It will come

Humanity must perforce prey on itself

Like monsters of the deep

See thyself devil

Proper deformity shows not in the fiend

So horrid as in woman

Thou changd and self-covered thing for shame

Bemonster not thy feature Were 't my fitness

To let these hands obey my blood

They are apt enough to dislocate and tear

Thy flesh and bones Howe'er thou art a fiend

A woman's shape doth shield thee

What news

Gloucester's eyes

This shows you are above

You justicers that these our nether crimes

So speedily can venge But O poor Gloucester

Lost he his other eye

Where was his son when they did take his eyes

He is not here

Knows he the wickedness

Gloucester I live

To thank thee for the love thou show'd'st the King

And to revenge thine eyesCome hither friend

Tell me what more thou know'st

Our very loving sister well bemet

Sir this I heard the King is come to his daughter

With others whom the rigor of our state

Forced to cry out Where I could not be honest

I never yet was valiant For this business

It touches us as France invades our land

Not bolds the King with others whom I fear

Most just and heavy causes make oppose

Let's then determine

With th' ancient of war on our proceeding

 I'll overtake youSpeak

Stay till I have read the letter

Why fare thee well I will o'erlook thy paper

We will greet the time

Sir you have showed today your valiant strain

And Fortune led you well You have the captives

Who were the opposites of this day's strife

I do require them of you so to use them

As we shall find their merits and our safety

May equally determine

Sir by your patience

I hold you but a subject of this war

Not as a brother

The let-alone lies not in your goodwill

Half-blooded fellow yes

Stay yet hear reasonEdmund I arrest thee

On capital treason and in thine attaint

This gilded serpentFor your claim fair sister

I bar it in the interest of my wife

'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord

And I her husband contradict your banns

If you will marry make your loves to me

My lady is bespoke

Thou art armed Gloucester Let the trumpet sound

If none appear to prove upon thy person

Thy heinous manifest and many treasons

There is my pledge I'll make it on thy heart

Ere I taste bread thou art in nothing less

Than I have here proclaimed thee

A herald ho

Trust to thy single virtue for thy soldiers

All levied in my name have in my name

Took their discharge

She is not well Convey her to my tent

Come hither herald Let the trumpet sound

And read out this

Ask him his purposes why he appears

Upon this call o' th' trumpet

Which is that adversary

Save him save him

Shut your mouth dame

Or with this paper shall I stopple itHold sir

Thou worse than any name read thine own evil

No tearing lady I perceive you know it

Most monstrous O

Know'st thou this paper

Go after her she's desperate Govern her

Methought thy very gait did prophesy

A royal nobleness I must embrace thee

Let sorrow split my heart if ever I

Did hate thee or thy father

Where have you hid yourself

How have you known the miseries of your father

If there be more more woeful hold it in

For I am almost ready to dissolve

Hearing of this

But who was this

Speak man

Who dead Speak man

Produce the bodies be they alive or dead

This judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble

Touches us not with pity O is this he

The time will not allow the compliment

Which very manners urges

Great thing of us forgot

Speak Edmund where's the King And where's Cordelia

Seest thou this object Kent

Even soCover their faces

Run run O run

The gods defend herBear him hence awhile

Fall and cease

He knows not what he says and vain is it

That we present us to him

That's but a trifle here

You lords and noble friends know our intent

What comfort to this great decay may come

Shall be applied For us we will resign

During the life of this old Majesty

To him our absolute power you to your rights

With boot and such addition as your Honors

Have more than merited All friends shall taste

The wages of their virtue and all foes

The cup of their deservings O see see

Bear them from hence Our present business

Is general woe Friends of my soul you twain

Rule in this realm and the gored state sustain
