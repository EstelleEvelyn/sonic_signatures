


A contract of eternal bond of love

Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands

Attested by the holy close of lips

Strengthened by interchangement of your rings

And all the ceremony of this compact

Sealed in my function by my testimony

Since when my watch hath told me toward my grave

I have traveled but two hours
