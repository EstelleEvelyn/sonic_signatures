everyone Coriolanus will carry it

'Faith there hath been many great

men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved

them and there be many that they have loved they

know not wherefore so that if they love they

know not why they hate upon no better a ground

Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether

they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge

he has in their disposition and out of his noble

carelessness lets them plainly see 't

He hath deserved worthily of his

country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees

as those who having been supple and courteous to

the people bonneted without any further deed to

have them at all into their estimation and report

but he hath so planted his honors in their eyes and

his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to

be silent and not confess so much were a kind of

ingrateful injury To report otherwise were a malice

that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof

and rebuke from every ear that heard it
