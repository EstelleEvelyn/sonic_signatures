Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,

Makes the sea serve them, which they ear and wound

With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads

They make in Italy—the borders maritime

Lack blood to think on ’t—and flush youth revolt.

No vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon

Taken as seen, for Pompey’s name strikes more

Than could his war resisted.
