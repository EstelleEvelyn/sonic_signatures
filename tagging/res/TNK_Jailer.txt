may cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep,

though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come;

before one salmon you shall take a number of minnows.

I am given out to be better lined than it can

appear to me report is a true speaker. I would I

were really that I am delivered to be. Marry, what

I have, be it what it will, I will assure upon my

daughter at the day of my death.

Well, we will talk more of this when the solemnity

is past. But have you a full promise of her?

When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.

Your friend and I have chanced

to name you here, upon the old business. But no

more of that now; so soon as the court hurry is

over, we will have an end of it. I’ th’ meantime,

look tenderly to the two prisoners. I can tell you

they are princes.

They are famed to be a pair of absolute men.

I heard them reported in the battle to be the

only doers.

Do they so?

The Duke himself came privately in the night,

and so did they.

What the reason of it is, I know not. Look, yonder

they are; that’s Arcite looks out.

Go to, leave your pointing; they would not

make us their object. Out of their sight.

By your leave, gentlemen.

Lord Arcite, you must presently to th’ Duke;

The cause I know not yet.

Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you

Of your fair cousin’s company.

Banished. Prince Pirithous

Obtained his liberty, but never more

Upon his oath and life must he set foot

Upon this kingdom.

My lord, for you

I have this charge to—

No, but from this place to remove your Lordship;

The windows are too open.

And hang for ’t afterward!

Why, my lord?

Indeed you must, my lord.

No.

I must constrain you then; and, for you are dangerous,

I’ll clap more irons on you.

There is no remedy.

Heard you no more? Was nothing said of me

Concerning the escape of Palamon?

Good sir, remember!

Pray heaven it hold so.

They are welcome.

You are a good man

And ever bring good news.

I hope they are good.

Why do you ask?

This morning.

I do not think she was very well—for now

You make me mind her; but this very day

I asked her questions, and she answered me

So far from what she was, so childishly,

So sillily, as if she were a fool,

An innocent, and I was very angry.

But what of her, sir?

Well, sir?

I half suspected

What you told me. The gods comfort her!

Either this was her love to Palamon,

Or fear of my miscarrying on his ’scape,

Or both.

But why all this haste, sir?

Pray go on, sir.

’Tis true.

Yes, wench, we know him.

’Tis, love.

She’s lost past all cure.

Yes.

Here.

Owgh, owgh, owgh!—’Tis up!

The wind’s fair!—Top the bowline!—Out with the

main sail! Where’s your whistle, master?

Up to the top, boy!

She is continually in a harmless distemper,

sleeps little, altogether without appetite, save often

drinking, dreaming of another world, and a better;

and what broken piece of matter soe’er she’s about,

the name Palamon lards it, that she farces ev’ry

business withal, fits it to every question.

Look where she comes; you shall perceive her

behavior.

E’en thus all day long.

What think you of her, sir?

Alas, what then?

I was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed her

liking on this gentleman, my friend.

Ho there, doctor!

But first, by your leave,

I’ th’ way of honesty.

Thank you, doctor.

I will, and tell her

Her Palamon stays for her. But, doctor,

Methinks you are i’ th’ wrong still.

Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child,

And has done this long hour, to visit you.

Yes.

He’s a very fair one.

No.

That’s fine indeed.

Having these virtues,

I think he might be brought to play at tennis.

Can he write and read too?

Very well.

What dowry has she?

Make curtsy; here your love comes.

Yes.

Are they i’ th’ field?

I’ll away straight.—

I must e’en leave you here.

How did you like her?

Sir, she’s well restored,

And to be married shortly.

The gods requite you all and make her thankful!
