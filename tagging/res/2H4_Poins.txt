not have attached one of so high blood

Why a prince should not be so loosely studied

as to remember so weak a composition

How ill it follows after you have labored so

hard you should talk so idly Tell me how many

good young princes would do so their fathers being

so sick as yours at this time is

Yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing

Go to I stand the push of your one thing that

you will tell

Very hardly upon such a subject

The reason

I would think thee a most princely hypocrite

Why because you have been so lewd and so

much engraffed to Falstaff

By this light I am well spoke on I can hear it

with mine own ears The worst that they can say of

me is that I am a second brother and that I am a

proper fellow of my hands and those two things I

confess I cannot help By the Mass here comes

Bardolph

Come you virtuous ass you bashful

fool must you be blushing Wherefore blush

you now What a maidenly man-at-arms are you

become Is 't such a matter to get a pottle-pot's

maidenhead

O that this good blossom could be kept from

cankers Well there is sixpence to preserve thee

Delivered with good respect And how doth the

Martlemas your master

Marry the immortal part needs a physician but

that moves not him Though that be sick it dies not

John Falstaff knight

Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion

to name himself even like those that are kin to the

King for they never prick their finger but they say

There's some of the King's blood spilt How

comes that says he that takes upon him not to

conceive The answer is as ready as a borrower's

cap I am the King's poor cousin sir

Why this is a certificate

He sure means brevity in breath short-winded

My lord I'll steep this letter in sack and make

him eat it

God send the wench no worse fortune But I

never said so

I am your shadow my lord I'll follow you

I warrant you as common as the way between

Saint Albans and London

Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons and

wait upon him at his table as drawers

Let's beat him before his whore

Is it not strange that desire should so many years

outlive performance

And look whether the fiery trigon his man be

not lisping to his master's old tables his notebook

his counsel keeper

Anon anon sir

My lord he will drive you out of your revenge

and turn all to a merriment if you take not the heat

No abuse

Answer thou dead elm answer
