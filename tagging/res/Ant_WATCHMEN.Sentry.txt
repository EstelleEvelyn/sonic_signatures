We must return to th' court of guard The night

Is shiny and they say we shall embattle

By th' second hour i' th' morn

Enobarbus

Let's hear him for the things he speaks may

concern Caesar

Swoons rather for so bad a prayer as his

Was never yet for sleep

The hand of death hath raught him Hark the drums

Demurely wake the sleepers Let us bear him

To th' court of guard he is of note Our hour

Is fully out
