


The cry’s “À Palamon.”

Still “Palamon.”

They said that Palamon had Arcite’s body

Within an inch o’ th’ pyramid, that the cry

Was general “À Palamon.” But anon,

Th’ assistants made a brave redemption, and

The two bold titlers at this instant are

Hand to hand at it.

Nay, now the sound is “Arcite.”

The cry is “Arcite”

And “Victory! Hark, Arcite, victory!”

The combat’s consummation is proclaimed

By the wind instruments.
