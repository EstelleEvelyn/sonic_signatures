


Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths

That we may hew his limbs and on a pile

Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh

Before this earthy prison of their bones

That so the shadows be not unappeased

Nor we disturbed with prodigies on Earth

Away with him and make a fire straight

And with our swords upon a pile of wood

Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed

See lord and father how we have performed

Our Roman rites Alarbus' limbs are lopped

And entrails feed the sacrificing fire

Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky

Remaineth naught but to inter our brethren

And with loud larums welcome them to Rome

Proud Saturnine interrupter of the good

That noble-minded Titus means to thee

And that he will and shall if Lucius live

My lord you are unjust and more than so

In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son

Dead if you will but not to be his wife

That is another's lawful promised love

But let us give him burial as becomes

Give Mutius burial with our brethren

Dear father soul and substance of us all

There lie thy bones sweet Mutius with thy friends'

Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb

No man shed tears for noble Mutius

He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause

We do and vow to heaven and to his Highness

That what we did was mildly as we might

Tend'ring our sister's honor and our own

O noble father you lament in vain

The Tribunes hear you not no man is by

And you recount your sorrows to a stone

My gracious lord no tribune hears you speak

To rescue my two brothers from their death

For which attempt the Judges have pronounced

My everlasting doom of banishment

Ay me this object kills me

Speak gentle sister Who hath martyred thee

O say thou for her who hath done this deed

Sweet father cease your tears for at your grief

See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps

Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks

Stay father for that noble hand of thine

That hath thrown down so many enemies

Shall not be sent My hand will serve the turn

My youth can better spare my blood than you

And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives

By heaven it shall not go

Sweet father if I shall be thought thy son

Let me redeem my brothers both from death

Then I'll go fetch an ax

Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound

And yet detested life not shrink thereat

That ever death should let life bear his name

Where life hath no more interest but to breathe

Farewell Andronicus my noble father

The woefull'st man that ever lived in Rome

Farewell proud Rome till Lucius come again

He loves his pledges dearer than his life

Farewell Lavinia my noble sister

O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been

But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives

But in oblivion and hateful griefs

If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs

And make proud Saturnine and his empress

Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen

Now will I to the Goths and raise a power

To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine

Approvd warriors and my faithful friends

I have receivd letters from great Rome

Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor

And how desirous of our sight they are

Therefore great lords be as your titles witness

Imperious and impatient of your wrongs

And wherein Rome hath done you any scathe

Let him make treble satisfaction

I humbly thank him and I thank you all

But who comes here led by a lusty Goth

O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil

That robbed Andronicus of his good hand

This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye

And here's the base fruit of her burning lust

Say wall-eyed slave whither wouldst thou convey

This growing image of thy fiendlike face

Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word

A halter soldiers Hang him on this tree

And by his side his fruit of bastardy

Too like the sire for ever being good

First hang the child that he may see it sprawl

A sight to vex the father's soul withal

Get me a ladder

Say on and if it please me which thou speak'st

Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished

Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live

Who should I swear by Thou believest no god

That granted how canst thou believe an oath

Even by my god I swear to thee I will

O most insatiate and luxurious woman

O detestable villain call'st thou that trimming

O barbarous beastly villains like thyself

Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds

Bring down the devil for he must not die

So sweet a death as hanging presently

Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more

Let him come near

Welcome Aemilius What's the news from Rome

Aemilius let the Emperor give his pledges

Unto my father and my uncle Marcus

And we will come March away

Uncle Marcus since 'tis my father's mind

That I repair to Rome I am content

Good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor

This ravenous tiger this accursd devil

Let him receive no sust'nance Fetter him

Till he be brought unto the Empress' face

For testimony of her foul proceedings

And see the ambush of our friends be strong

I fear the Emperor means no good to us

Away inhuman dog unhallowed slave

Sirs help our uncle to convey him in

The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand

What boots it thee to call thyself a sun

Can the son's eye behold his father bleed

There's meed for meed death for a deadly deed

Then gracious auditory be it known to you

That Chiron and the damned Demetrius

Were they that murderd our emperor's brother

And they it were that ravishd our sister

For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded

Our father's tears despised and basely cozened

Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out

And sent her enemies unto the grave

Lastly myself unkindly banishd

The gates shut on me and turned weeping out

To beg relief among Rome's enemies

Who drowned their enmity in my true tears

And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend

I am the turned-forth be it known to you

That have preserved her welfare in my blood

And from her bosom took the enemy's point

Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body

Alas you know I am no vaunter I

My scars can witness dumb although they are

That my report is just and full of truth

But soft methinks I do digress too much

Citing my worthless praise O pardon me

For when no friends are by men praise themselves

Thanks gentle Romans May I govern so

To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe

But gentle people give me aim awhile

For nature puts me to a heavy task

Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near

To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk

O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips

These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face

The last true duties of thy noble son

Come hither boy Come come and learn of us

To melt in showers Thy grandsire loved thee well

Many a time he danced thee on his knee

Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow

Many a story hath he told to thee

And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind

And talk of them when he was dead and gone

Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him

There let him stand and rave and cry for food

If anyone relieves or pities him

For the offense he dies This is our doom

Some stay to see him fastened in the earth

Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence

And give him burial in his fathers' grave

My father and Lavinia shall forthwith

Be closd in our household's monument

As for that ravenous tiger Tamora

No funeral rite nor man in mourning weed

No mournful bell shall ring her burial

But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey

Her life was beastly and devoid of pity

And being dead let birds on her take pity
