


You are well encountered here my cousin Mowbray

Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop

And so to you Lord Hastings and to all

My Lord of York it better showed with you

When that your flock assembled by the bell

Encircled you to hear with reverence

Your exposition on the holy text

Than now to see you here an iron man talking

Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum

Turning the word to sword and life to death

That man that sits within a monarch's heart

And ripens in the sunshine of his favor

Would he abuse the countenance of the King

Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach

In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop

It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken

How deep you were within the books of God

To us the speaker in His parliament

To us th' imagined voice of God Himself

The very opener and intelligencer

Between the grace the sanctities of heaven

And our dull workings O who shall believe

But you misuse the reverence of your place

Employ the countenance and grace of heaven

As a false favorite doth his prince's name

In deeds dishonorable You have ta'en up

Under the counterfeited zeal of God

The subjects of His substitute my father

And both against the peace of heaven and him

Have here up-swarmed them

You are too shallow Hastings much too shallow

To sound the bottom of the after-times

I like them all and do allow them well

And swear here by the honor of my blood

My father's purposes have been mistook

And some about him have too lavishly

Wrested his meaning and authority

My lord these griefs shall be with speed redressed

Upon my soul they shall If this may please you

Discharge your powers unto their several counties

As we will ours and here between the armies

Let's drink together friendly and embrace

That all their eyes may bear those tokens home

Of our restord love and amity

I give it you and will maintain my word

And thereupon I drink unto your Grace

The word of peace is rendered Hark how they shout

Go my lord

And let our army be dischargd too

And good my lord so please you let our trains

March by us that we may peruse the men

We should have coped withal

I trust lords we shall lie tonight together

Now cousin wherefore stands our army still

They know their duties

I pawned thee none

I promised you redress of these same grievances

Whereof you did complain which by mine honor

I will perform with a most Christian care

But for you rebels look to taste the due

Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours

Most shallowly did you these arms commence

Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence

Strike up our drums pursue the scattered stray

God and not we hath safely fought today

Some guard these traitors to the block of death

Treason's true bed and yielder-up of breath

The heat is past Follow no further now

Call in the powers good cousin Westmoreland

Now Falstaff where have you been all this while

When everything is ended then you come

These tardy tricks of yours will on my life

One time or other break some gallows' back

It was more of his courtesy than

your deserving

Thine's too heavy to mount

Thine's too thick to shine

Is thy name Colevile

A famous rebel art thou

Colevile

Now have you left pursuit

Send Colevile with his confederates

To York to present execution

Blunt lead him hence and see you guard him sure

And now dispatch we toward the court my lords

I hear the King my father is sore sick

Our news shall go before us to his Majesty

Which cousin you shall bear to comfort him

And we with sober speed will follow you

Fare you well Falstaff I in my condition

Shall better speak of you than you deserve

Health peace and happiness to my royal father

Good morrow cousin Warwick good morrow

We meet like men that had forgot to speak

Well peace be with him that hath made us heavy

Though no man be assured what grace to find

You stand in coldest expectation

I am the sorrier would 'twere otherwise

We hope no otherwise from your Majesty

I like this fair proceeding of the King's

He hath intent his wonted followers

Shall all be very well provided for

But all are banished till their conversations

Appear more wise and modest to the world

The King hath called his parliament my lord

I will lay odds that ere this year expire

We bear our civil swords and native fire

As far as France I heard a bird so sing

Whose music to my thinking pleased the King

Come will you hence
