That by proscription and bills of outlawry,

Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus

Have put to death an hundred senators.

Cicero is dead,

And by that order of proscription.

Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

That methinks is strange.

No, my lord.

Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell,

For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

Even so great men great losses should endure.

Good night, Lord Brutus.

What says my general?

Believe not so.

It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius

Is overthrown by noble Brutus’ power,

As Cassius’ legions are by Antony.

Where did you leave him?

Is not that he that lies upon the ground?

Is not that he?

Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.

O hateful error, melancholy’s child,

Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men

The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,

Thou never com’st unto a happy birth

But kill’st the mother that engendered thee!

Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet

The noble Brutus, thrusting this report

Into his ears. I may say “thrusting it,”

For piercing steel and darts envenomèd

Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus

As tidings of this sight.

Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.

My master’s man.—Strato, where is thy master?

How died my master, Strato?

Octavius, then take him to follow thee,

That did the latest service to my master.
