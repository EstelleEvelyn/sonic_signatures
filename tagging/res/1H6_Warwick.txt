Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,

Between two blades, which bears the better temper,

Between two horses, which doth bear him best,

Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,

I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;

But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,

Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.

I love no colors; and, without all color

Of base insinuating flattery,

I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.

Now, by God’s will, thou wrong’st him, Somerset.

His grandfather was Lionel, Duke of Clarence,

Third son to the third Edward, King of England.

Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?

This blot that they object against your house

Shall be whipped out in the next parliament,

Called for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;

And if thou be not then created York,

I will not live to be accounted Warwick.

Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,

Against proud Somerset and William Pole

Will I upon thy party wear this rose.

And here I prophesy: this brawl today,

Grown to this faction in the Temple garden,

Shall send, between the red rose and the white,

A thousand souls to death and deadly night.

My lord, it were your duty to forbear.

Methinks his Lordship should be humbler.

It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.

State holy, or unhallowed, what of that?

Is not his Grace Protector to the King?

An uproar, I dare warrant,

Begun through malice of the Bishop’s men.

Yield, my Lord Protector—yield, Winchester—

Except you mean with obstinate repulse

To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.

You see what mischief, and what murder too,

Hath been enacted through your enmity.

Then be at peace, except you thirst for blood.

Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke

Hath banished moody discontented fury,

As by his smoothèd brows it doth appear.

Why look you still so stern and tragical?

Sweet king! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.—

For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent;

What, shall a child instruct you what to do?

Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,

Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet

We do exhibit to your Majesty.

Let Richard be restorèd to his blood;

So shall his father’s wrongs be recompensed.

Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York.

My Lord of York, I promise you the King

Prettily, methought, did play the orator.

Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not.

I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.

Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?

And hark you, sirs: because she is a maid,

Spare for no faggots; let there be enow.

Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake

That so her torture may be shortenèd.

The greatest miracle that e’er you wrought!

Is all your strict preciseness come to this?

Well, go to, we’ll have no bastards live,

Especially since Charles must father it.

A married man? That’s most intolerable.

It’s sign she hath been liberal and free.

Be patient, York; if we conclude a peace

It shall be with such strict and severe covenants

As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.

How say’st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand?
