


When daffodils begin to peer

With heigh the doxy over the dale

Why then comes in the sweet o' the year

For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale

The white sheet bleaching on the hedge

With heigh the sweet birds O how they sing

Doth set my pugging tooth an edge

For a quart of ale is a dish for a king

The lark that tirralirra chants

With heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay

Are summer songs for me and my aunts

While we lie tumbling in the hay

I have served Prince Florizell and in my time wore

three-pile but now I am out of service

But shall I go mourn for that my dear

The pale moon shines by night

And when I wander here and there

I then do most go right

If tinkers may have leave to live

And bear the sow-skin budget

Then my account I well may give

And in the stocks avouch it

My traffic is sheets When the kite builds look to

lesser linen My father named me Autolycus who

being as I am littered under Mercury was likewise

a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles With die and

drab I purchased this caparison and my revenue is

the silly cheat Gallows and knock are too powerful

on the highway Beating and hanging are terrors to

me For the life to come I sleep out the thought of

it A prize a prize

If the springe hold the cock's

mine

O that ever I was

born

O help me help me Pluck but off these

rags and then death death

O sir the loathsomeness of them offends

me more than the stripes I have received which are

mighty ones and millions

I am robbed sir and beaten my money

and apparel ta'en from me and these detestable

things put upon me

A footman sweet sir a footman

O good sir tenderly O

O good sir softly good sir I fear sir my

shoulder blade is out

Softly

dear sir good sir softly You ha' done me a charitable

office

No good sweet sir no I beseech you sir I

have a kinsman not past three-quarters of a mile

hence unto whom I was going I shall there have

money or anything I want Offer me no money I

pray you that kills my heart

A fellow sir that I have known to go about

with troll-my-dames I knew him once a servant of

the Prince I cannot tell good sir for which of his

virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of

the court

Vices I would say sir I know this man

well He hath been since an ape-bearer then a

process-server a bailiff Then he compassed a motion

of the Prodigal Son and married a tinker's wife

within a mile where my land and living lies and

having flown over many knavish professions he

settled only in rogue Some call him Autolycus

Very true sir he sir he That's the rogue

that put me into this apparel

I must confess to you sir I am no fighter I

am false of heart that way and that he knew I

warrant him

Sweet sir much better than I was I can

stand and walk I will even take my leave of you and

pace softly towards my kinsman's

No good-faced sir no sweet sir

Prosper you sweet sir

Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your

spice I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too If

I make not this cheat bring out another and the

shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my

name put in the book of virtue

Jog on jog on the footpath way

And merrily hent the stile-a

A merry heart goes all the day

Your sad tires in a mile-a

Lawn as white as driven snow

Cypress black as e'er was crow

Gloves as sweet as damask roses

Masks for faces and for noses

Bugle bracelet necklace amber

Perfume for a lady's chamber

Golden coifs and stomachers

For my lads to give their dears

Pins and poking-sticks of steel

What maids lack from head to heel

Come buy of me come Come buy come buy

Buy lads or else your lasses cry

Come buy

And indeed sir there are cozeners abroad

therefore it behooves men to be wary

I hope so sir for I have about me many

parcels of charge

Here's one to a very doleful tune how a

usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty moneybags

at a burden and how she longed to eat adders'

heads and toads carbonadoed

Very true and but a month old

Here's the midwife's name to 't one Mistress

Taleporter and five or six honest wives that

were present Why should I carry lies abroad

Here's another ballad of a fish that appeared

upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore

of April forty thousand fathom above water and

sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids It

was thought she was a woman and was turned into

a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with

one that loved her The ballad is very pitiful and as

true

Five justices' hands at it and witnesses

more than my pack will hold

This is a merry ballad but a very pretty

one

Why this is a passing merry one and goes

to the tune of Two Maids Wooing a Man There's

scarce a maid westward but she sings it 'Tis in

request I can tell you

I can bear my part You must know 'tis my

occupation Have at it with you

Get you hence for I must go

Where it fits not you to know

Neither

Neither

And you shall pay well for 'em

Will you buy any tape

Or lace for your cape

My dainty duck my dear-a

Any silk any thread

Any toys for your head

Of the new'st and fin'st fin'st wear-a

Come to the peddler

Money's a meddler

That doth utter all men's ware-a

Ha ha what a fool Honesty is And Trust

his sworn brother a very simple gentleman I have

sold all my trumpery Not a counterfeit stone not a

ribbon glass pomander brooch table book ballad

knife tape glove shoe tie bracelet horn ring

to keep my pack from fasting They throng who

should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed

and brought a benediction to the buyer by which

means I saw whose purse was best in picture and

what I saw to my good use I remembered My

clown who wants but something to be a reasonable

man grew so in love with the wenches' song that he

would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and

words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that

all their other senses stuck in ears You might have

pinched a placket it was senseless 'twas nothing to

geld a codpiece of a purse I could have filed

keys off that hung in chains No hearing no feeling

but my sir's song and admiring the nothing of it So

that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of

their festival purses And had not the old man come

in with a hubbub against his daughter and the

King's son and scared my choughs from the chaff I

had not left a purse alive in the whole army

If they have overheard me now why hanging

I am a poor fellow sir

I am a poor fellow sir I know you

well enough

Are you in earnest sir I smell the

trick on 't

Indeed I have had earnest but I cannot

with conscience take it

Adieu sir

I understand the business I hear it To have

an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is

necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite

also to smell out work for th' other senses I see this

is the time that the unjust man doth thrive What an

exchange had this been without boot What a boot

is here with this exchange Sure the gods do this

year connive at us and we may do anything extempore

The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity

stealing away from his father with his clog at his

heels If I thought it were a piece of honesty to

acquaint the King withal I would not do 't I hold it

the more knavery to conceal it and therein am I

constant to my profession

Aside aside Here is more matter for a hot brain

Every lane's end every shop church session hanging

yields a careful man work

Very wisely puppies

I know not what impediment this

complaint may be to the flight of my master

Though I am not naturally honest

I am so sometimes by chance Let me pocket up my

peddler's excrement

How now rustics whither are you bound

Your affairs there What with whom the

condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling

your names your ages of what having breeding

and anything that is fitting to be known discover

A lie you are rough and hairy Let me have

no lying It becomes none but tradesmen and they

often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it

with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore

they do not give us the lie

Whether it like me or no I am a courtier

Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings

Hath not my gait in it the measure of the

court Receives not thy nose court odor from me

Reflect I not on thy baseness court contempt

Think'st thou for that I insinuate and toze from

thee thy business I am therefore no courtier I am

courtier cap-a-pie and one that will either push on

or pluck back thy business there Whereupon I

command thee to open thy affair

What advocate hast thou to him

How blest are we that are not simple men

Yet Nature might have made me as these are

Therefore I will not disdain

The fardel there What's i' th' fardel

Wherefore that box

Age thou hast lost thy labor

The King is not at the palace He is gone

aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air

himself for if thou beest capable of things serious

thou must know the King is full of grief

If that shepherd be not in handfast let him

fly The curses he shall have the tortures he shall

feel will break the back of man the heart of

monster

Not he alone shall suffer what wit can

make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are

germane to him though removed fifty times shall

all come under the hangmanwhich though it be

great pity yet it is necessary An old sheep-whistling

rogue a ram tender to offer to have his daughter

come into grace Some say he shall be stoned but

that death is too soft for him say I Draw our throne

into a sheepcote All deaths are too few the sharpest

too easy

He has a son who shall be flayed alive then

'nointed over with honey set on the head of a

wasps'-nest then stand till he be three-quarters and

a dram dead then recovered again with aqua vitae

or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and

in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall

he be set against a brick wall the sun looking with a

southward eye upon him where he is to behold him

with flies blown to death But what talk we of these

traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at

their offenses being so capital Tell mefor you

seem to be honest plain menwhat you have to the

King Being something gently considered I'll bring

you where he is aboard tender your persons to his

presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be

in man besides the King to effect your suits here is

man shall do it

After I have done what I promised

Well give me the moiety

Are you a party in this business

O that's the case of the shepherd's son

Hang him he'll be made an example

I will trust you Walk before toward the

seaside Go on the right hand I will but look upon

the hedge and follow you

If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune

would not suffer me She drops booties in my

mouth I am courted now with a double occasion

gold and a means to do the Prince my master good

which who knows how that may turn back to my

advancement I will bring these two moles these

blind ones aboard him If he think it fit to shore

them again and that the complaint they have to the

King concerns him nothing let him call me rogue

for being so far officious for I am proof against that

title and what shame else belongs to 't To him will I

present them There may be matter in it

Beseech you sir were you present at this

relation

I would most gladly know the issue of it

Now had I not the dash of my former life

in me would preferment drop on my head I

brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince

told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know

not what But he at that time overfond of the

shepherd's daughterso he then took her to be

who began to be much seasick and himself little

better extremity of weather continuing this mystery

remained undiscovered But 'tis all one to

me for had I been the finder-out of this secret it

would not have relished among my other

discredits

Here come those I have done good to against my

will and already appearing in the blossoms of their

fortune

I know you are now sir a gentleman born

I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all

the faults I have committed to your Worship and to

give me your good report to the Prince my master

Ay an it like your good Worship

I will prove so sir to my power
