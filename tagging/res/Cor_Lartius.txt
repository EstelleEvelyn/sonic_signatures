
No Caius Martius

I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t' other

Ere stay behind this business

Lead you on

Follow Cominius We must follow you

Right worthy you priority

My horse to yours no

Agreed

So the good horse is mine

No I'll nor sell nor give him Lend you him I will

For half a hundred yearsSummon the town

Their noise be our instructionLadders ho

What is become of Martius

O noble fellow

Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword

And when it bows stand'st up Thou art left Martius

A carbuncle entire as big as thou art

Were not so rich a jewel Thou wast a soldier

Even to Cato's wish not fierce and terrible

Only in strokes but with thy grim looks and

The thunderlike percussion of thy sounds

Thou mad'st thine enemies shake as if the world

Were feverous and did tremble

O 'tis Martius

Let's fetch him off or make remain alike

Worthy sir thou bleed'st

Thy exercise hath been too violent

For a second course of fight

Now the fair goddess Fortune

Fall deep in love with thee and her great charms

Misguide thy opposers' swords Bold gentleman

Prosperity be thy page

Thou worthiest Martius

Go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace

Call thither all the officers o' th' town

Where they shall know our mind Away

So let the ports be guarded Keep your duties

As I have set them down If I do send dispatch

Those centuries to our aid the rest will serve

For a short holding If we lose the field

We cannot keep the town

Hence and shut your gates upon 's

Our guider come To th' Roman camp conduct us

O general

Here is the steed we the caparison

Hadst thou beheld

Martius Caius Coriolanus

I shall my lord

Martius his name

He had my lord and that it was which caused

Our swifter composition

On safeguard he came to me and did curse

Against the Volsces for they had so vilely

Yielded the town He is retired to Antium

He did my lord

How often he had met you sword to sword

That of all things upon the earth he hated

Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes

To hopeless restitution so he might

Be called your vanquisher

At Antium

Peace peace peace Stay hold peace
