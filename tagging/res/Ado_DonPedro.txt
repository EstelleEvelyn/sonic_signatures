


Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet

your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid

cost, and you encounter it.

You embrace your charge too willingly.

I think this is your daughter.

You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by

this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady

fathers herself.—Be happy, lady, for you are like

an honorable father.

That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior

Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend

Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay

here at the least a month, and he heartily prays

some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear

he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.

Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.

What secret hath held you here that you followed

not to Leonato’s?

I charge thee on thy allegiance.

Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well

worthy.

By my troth, I speak my thought.

That she is worthy, I know.

Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the

despite of beauty.

I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.

Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou

wilt prove a notable argument.

Well, as time shall try.

In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.

Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in

Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.

Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the

meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s.

Commend me to him, and tell him I will not

fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great

preparation.

The sixth of July. Your loving friend,

Benedick.

My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,

And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn

Any hard lesson that may do thee good.

No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.

Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

Thou wilt be like a lover presently

And tire the hearer with a book of words.

If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,

And I will break with her and with her father,

And thou shalt have her. Was ’t not to this end

That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?

What need the bridge much broader than the flood?

The fairest grant is the necessity.

Look what will serve is fit. ’Tis once, thou lovest,

And I will fit thee with the remedy.

I know we shall have reveling tonight.

I will assume thy part in some disguise

And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,

And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart

And take her hearing prisoner with the force

And strong encounter of my amorous tale.

Then after to her father will I break,

And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.

In practice let us put it presently.

Lady, will you walk a bout with your

friend?

With me in your company?

And when please you to say so?

My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house

is Jove.

Speak low if you speak love.

Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see

him?

To be whipped? What’s his fault?

Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The

transgression is in the stealer.

I will but teach them to sing and restore them

to the owner.

The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The

gentleman that danced with her told her she is

much wronged by you.

Look, here she comes.

None but to desire your good company.

Come, lady, come, you have lost

the heart of Signior Benedick.

You have put him down, lady, you have put

him down.

Why, how now, count, wherefore are you sad?

How then, sick?

I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true,

though I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is

false.—Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name,

and fair Hero is won. I have broke with her father

and his goodwill obtained. Name the day of marriage,

and God give thee joy.

In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.

Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

Will you have me, lady?

Your silence most offends me, and to be merry

best becomes you, for out o’ question you were

born in a merry hour.

By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.

She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

County Claudio, when mean you to go to

church?

Come, you shake the head at so

long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the

time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim

undertake one of Hercules’ labors, which is to bring

Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a

mountain of affection, th’ one with th’ other. I

would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to

fashion it, if you three will but minister such

assistance as I shall give you direction.

And you too, gentle Hero?

And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband

that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of

a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed

honesty. I will teach you how to humor your

cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick.—

And I, with your two helps, will so practice on

Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his

queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice.

If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his

glory shall be ours, for we are the only love gods. Go

in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

Come, shall we hear this music?

See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.

It is the witness still of excellency

To put a strange face on his own perfection.

I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.

Nay, pray thee, come,

Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,

Do it in notes.

Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks!

Note notes, forsooth, and nothing.

By my troth, a good song.

Ha, no, no, faith, thou sing’st well enough for a

shift.

Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray

thee get us some excellent music, for tomorrow

night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber

window.

Do so. Farewell.

Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of

today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with

Signior Benedick?

Maybe she doth but counterfeit.

Why, what effects of passion shows she?

How, how I pray you? You amaze me. I would

have thought her spirit had been invincible against

all assaults of affection.

Hath she made her affection known to

Benedick?

It were good that Benedick knew of it by some

other, if she will not discover it.

An he should, it were an alms to hang him.

She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion,

she is virtuous.

In everything but in loving Benedick.

I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I

would have daffed all other respects and made her

half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear

what he will say.

She doth well. If she should make tender of

her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man,

as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.

He hath indeed a good outward happiness.

He doth indeed show some sparks that are like

wit.

As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing

of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he

avoids them with great discretion or undertakes

them with a most Christianlike fear.

And so will he do, for the man doth fear God,

howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests

he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall

we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?

Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter.

Let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I

could wish he would modestly examine himself to

see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

Let there be the same net

spread for her, and that must your daughter and her

gentlewomen carry. The sport will be when they

hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no

such matter. That’s the scene that I would see,

which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her

to call him in to dinner.

I do but stay till your marriage be consummate,

and then go I toward Aragon.

Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new

gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new

coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold

with Benedick for his company, for from the crown

of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He

hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the

little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a

heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the

clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue

speaks.

Hang him, truant! There’s no true drop of

blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be

sad, he wants money.

Draw it.

What, sigh for the toothache?

There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless

it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to

be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or

in the shape of two countries at once, as a German

from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard

from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a

fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no

fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.

Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?

Nay, he rubs himself with civet. Can you smell

him out by that?

The greatest note of it is his melancholy.

Yea, or to paint himself? For the which I hear

what they say of him.

Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude,

conclude, he is in love.

That would I know, too. I warrant, one that

knows him not.

She shall be buried with her face upwards.

For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!

Good e’en, brother.

In private?

What’s the matter?

You know he does.

Why, what’s the matter?

I will not think it.

And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will

join with thee to disgrace her.

O day untowardly turned!

Nothing, unless you render her again.

What should I speak?

I stand dishonored that have gone about

To link my dear friend to a common stale.

Why, then, are you no maiden.—Leonato,

I am sorry you must hear. Upon mine honor,

Myself, my brother, and this grievèd count

Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night

Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window,

Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,

Confessed the vile encounters they have had

A thousand times in secret.

Good e’en, good e’en.

We have some haste, Leonato.

Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

You say not right, old man.

Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.

My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death,

But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing

But what was true and very full of proof.

I will not hear you.

See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.

Welcome, signior. You are almost come to

part almost a fray.

Leonato and his brother. What think’st thou?

Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too

young for them.

Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?

As I am an honest man, he looks pale.—Art

thou sick, or angry?

By this light, he changes more and more. I

think he be angry indeed.

What, a feast, a feast?

I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the

other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit. “True,” said

she, “a fine little one.” “No,” said I, “a great wit.”

“Right,” says she, “a great gross one.” “Nay,” said I,

“a good wit.” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.”

“Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.” “Certain,”

said she, “a wise gentleman.” “Nay,” said I, “he

hath the tongues.” “That I believe,” said she, “for he

swore a thing to me on Monday night which he

forswore on Tuesday morning; there’s a double

tongue, there’s two tongues.” Thus did she an hour

together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at

last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the

proper’st man in Italy.

Yea, that she did. But yet for all that, an if she

did not hate him deadly, she would love him

dearly. The old man’s daughter told us all.

But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns

on the sensible Benedick’s head?

He is in earnest.

And hath challenged thee?

What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his

doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!

But soft you, let me be. Pluck up, my heart,

and be sad. Did he not say my brother was fled?

How now, two of my brother’s men bound?

Borachio one!

Officers, what offense have these men done?

First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I

ask thee what’s their offense; sixth and lastly, why

they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay

to their charge.

Who have you offended,

masters, that you are thus bound to your

answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be

understood. What’s your offense?

Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?

But did my brother set thee on to this?

He is composed and framed of treachery,

And fled he is upon this villainy.

By my soul, nor I,

And yet to satisfy this good old man

I would bend under any heavy weight

That he’ll enjoin me to.

We will not fail.

Good morrow, masters. Put your torches out.

The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day

Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about

Dapples the drowsy east with spots of gray.

Thanks to you all, and leave us. Fare you well.

Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds,

And then to Leonato’s we will go.

Good morrow to this fair assembly.

Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter

That you have such a February face,

So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?

The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
