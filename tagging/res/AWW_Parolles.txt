


Save you fair queen

No

Are you meditating on virginity

Keep him out

There is none Man setting down before you

will undermine you and blow you up

Virginity being blown down man will

quicklier be blown up Marry in blowing him

down again with the breach yourselves made you

lose your city It is not politic in the commonwealth

of nature to preserve virginity Loss of virginity

is rational increase and there was never

virgin got till virginity was first lost That you

were made of is metal to make virgins Virginity by

being once lost may be ten times found by being

ever kept it is ever lost 'Tis too cold a companion

Away with 't

There's little can be said in 't 'Tis against the

rule of nature To speak on the part of virginity is

to accuse your mothers which is most infallible

disobedience He that hangs himself is a virgin

virginity murders itself and should be buried in

highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate

offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites

much like a cheese consumes itself to the very

paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach

Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of

self-love which is the most inhibited sin in the

canon Keep it not you cannot choose but lose by

't Out with 't Within ten year it will make itself

two which is a goodly increase and the principal

itself not much the worse Away with 't

Let me see Marry ill to like him that ne'er

it likes 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with

lying the longer kept the less worth Off with 't

while 'tis vendible answer the time of request Virginity

like an old courtier wears her cap out of

fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the

brooch and the toothpick which wear not now

Your date is better in your pie and your porridge

than in your cheek And your virginity your old

virginity is like one of our French withered pears

it looks ill it eats dryly many 'tis a withered pear

It was formerly better marry yet 'tis a withered

pear Will you anything with it

What one i' faith

What's pity

Little Helen farewell If I can remember

thee I will think of thee at court

Under Mars I

Why under Mars

When he was predominant

Why think you so

That's for advantage

I am so full of businesses I cannot answer

thee acutely I will return perfect courtier in the

which my instruction shall serve to naturalize

thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel

and understand what advice shall thrust upon

thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and

thine ignorance makes thee away Farewell When

thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast

none remember thy friends Get thee a good husband

and use him as he uses thee So farewell

'Tis not his fault the spark

Most admirable I have seen those wars

An thy mind stand to 't boy steal away bravely

Commit it count

Noble heroes my sword and yours are kin

Good sparks and lustrous a word good metals

You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one

Captain Spurio with his cicatrice an emblem of

war here on his sinister cheek It was this very

sword entrenched it Say to him I live and observe

his reports for me

Mars dote on you for his novices

What will you do

Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble

lords You have restrained yourself within the list

of too cold an adieu Be more expressive to them

for they wear themselves in the cap of the time

there do muster true gait eat speak and move

under the influence of the most received star and

though the devil lead the measure such are to be

followed After them and take a more dilated

farewell

Worthy fellows and like to prove most

sinewy swordmen

Why 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that

hath shot out in our latter times

So I say both of Galen and Paracelsus

Right so I say

Why there 'tis So say I too

Right as 'twere a man assured of a

Just You say well So would I have said

It is indeed If you will have it in showing

you shall read it in what-do-you-call there

That's it I would have said the very same

Nay 'tis strange 'tis very strange that is the

brief and the tedious of it and he's of a most facinorous

spirit that will not acknowledge it to be

the

Ay so I say

And debile minister Great power great

transcendence which should indeed give us a further

use to be made than alone the recov'ry of the

King as to be

I would have said it You say well Here

comes the King

Mort du vinaigre Is not this Helen

Your pleasure sir

Recantation My lord My master

A most harsh one and not to be understood

without bloody succeeding My master

To any count to all counts to what is man

You are too old sir let it satisfy you you are

too old

What I dare too well do I dare not do

Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity

upon thee

My lord you give me most egregious

indignity

I have not my lord deserved it

Well I shall be wiser

My lord you do me most insupportable

vexation

Well thou hast a son shall take this disgrace

off me Scurvy old filthy scurvy lord Well I must

be patient there is no fettering of authority I'll

beat him by my life if I can meet him with any

convenience an he were double and double a lord

I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have

ofI'll beat him an if I could but meet him again

I most unfeignedly beseech your Lordship

to make some reservation of your wrongs He is

my good lord whom I serve above is my master

Ay sir

This is hard and undeserved measure my

lord

Good very good It is so then Good very

good Let it be concealed awhile

What's the matter sweetheart

What what sweetheart

France is a dog-hole and it no more merits

the tread of a man's foot To th' wars

Ay that would be known To th' wars my

boy to th' wars

He wears his honor in a box unseen

That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home

Spending his manly marrow in her arms

Which should sustain the bound and high curvet

Of Mars's fiery steed To other regions

France is a stable we that dwell in 't jades

Therefore to th' war

Will this capriccio hold in thee Art sure

Why these balls bound there's noise in it 'Tis hard

A young man married is a man that's marred

Therefore away and leave her bravely Go

The King has done you wrong but hush 'tis so

Bless you my fortunate lady

You had my prayers to lead them on and to

keep them on have them stillO my knave how

does my old lady

Why I say nothing

Away Thou 'rt a knave

Go to Thou art a witty fool I have found

thee

A good knave i' faith and well fed

Madam my lord will go away tonight

A very serious business calls on him

The great prerogative and rite of love

Which as your due time claims he does acknowledge

But puts it off to a compelled restraint

Whose want and whose delay is strewed with sweets

Which they distill now in the curbd time

To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy

And pleasure drown the brim

That you will take your instant leave o' th' King

And make this haste as your own good proceeding

Strengthened with what apology you think

May make it probable need

That having this obtained you presently

Attend his further pleasure

I shall report it so

These things shall be done sir

Sir

She is

As you'll have her

I know not how I have deserved to run into

my lord's displeasure

An idle lord I swear

Why do you not know him

Bravely coraggio

Lose our drum Well

But a drum Is 't but a drum A drum so

lost There was excellent command to charge in

with our horse upon our own wings and to rend

our own soldiers

It might have been recovered

It is to be recovered But that the merit of

service is seldom attributed to the true and exact

performer I would have that drum or another or

hic jacet

By the hand of a soldier I will undertake it

I'll about it this evening and I will presently

pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my

certainty put myself into my mortal preparation

and by midnight look to hear further from me

I know not what the success will be my

lord but the attempt I vow

I love not many words

Ten o'clock Within these three hours 'twill

be time enough to go home What shall I say I have

done It must be a very plausive invention that

carries it They begin to smoke me and disgraces

have of late knocked too often at my door I find

my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the

fear of Mars before it and of his creatures not

daring the reports of my tongue

What the devil should move me to undertake

the recovery of this drum being not ignorant

of the impossibility and knowing I had no such

purpose I must give myself some hurts and say I

got them in exploit Yet slight ones will not carry it

They will say Came you off with so little And

great ones I dare not give Wherefore What's the

instance Tongue I must put you into a butter-woman's

mouth and buy myself another of

Bajazeth's mule if you prattle me into these perils

I would the cutting of my garments would

serve the turn or the breaking of my Spanish

sword

Or the baring of my beard and to say it was

in stratagem

Or to drown my clothes and say I was

stripped

Though I swore I leapt from the window of

the citadel

Thirty fathom

I would I had any drum of the enemy's I

would swear I recovered it

A drum now of the enemy's

O ransom ransom Do not hide mine eyes

I know you are the Muskos' regiment

And I shall lose my life for want of language

If there be here German or Dane Low Dutch

Italian or French let him speak to me

I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine

O

O let me live

And all the secrets of our camp I'll show

Their force their purposes Nay I'll speak that

Which you will wonder at

If I do not damn me

I will confess what I know without constraint

If you pinch me like a pasty I can say no

more

And truly as I hope to live

Five or six thousand but very weak and

unserviceable The troops are all scattered and the

commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation

and credit and as I hope to live

Do I'll take the Sacrament on 't how and

which way you will

Five or six thousand horse I saidI will

say trueor thereabouts set down for I'll speak

truth

Poor rogues I pray you say

I humbly thank you sir A truth's a truth

The rogues are marvelous poor

By my troth sir if I were to live but this

present hour I will tell true Let me see Spurio a

hundred and fifty Sebastian so many Corambus

so many Jaques so many Guiltian Cosmo

Lodowick and Gratii two hundred fifty each mine

own company Chitopher Vaumond Bentii two

hundred fifty each so that the muster-file rotten

and sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen

thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the

snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves

to pieces

I beseech you let me answer to the particular

of the inter'gatories Demand them singly

I know him He was a botcher's prentice in

Paris from whence he was whipped for getting the

shrieve's fool with child a dumb innocent that

could not say him nay

Upon my knowledge he is and lousy

The Duke knows him for no other but a

poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day

to turn him out o' th' band I think I have his letter

in my pocket

In good sadness I do not know Either it is

there or it is upon a file with the Duke's other letters

in my tent

I do not know if it be it or no

That is not the Duke's letter sir That is an

advertisement to a proper maid in Florence one

Diana to take heed of the allurement of one Count

Rossillion a foolish idle boy but for all that very

ruttish I pray you sir put it up again

My meaning in 't I protest was very honest

in the behalf of the maid for I knew the young

count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is

a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it

finds

My life sir in any case Not that I am afraid

to die but that my offenses being many I would

repent out the remainder of nature Let me live

sir in a dungeon i' th' stocks or anywhere so I

may live

He will steal sir an egg out of a cloister For

rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus He

professes not keeping of oaths In breaking 'em he

is stronger than Hercules He will lie sir with such

volubility that you would think truth were a fool

Drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be

swine-drunk and in his sleep he does little harm

save to his bedclothes about him but they know

his conditions and lay him in straw I have but

little more to say sir of his honesty he has everything

that an honest man should not have what an

honest man should have he has nothing

Faith sir has led the drum before the English

tragedians To belie him I will not and more

of his soldiership I know not except in that country

he had the honor to be the officer at a place

there called Mile End to instruct for the doubling

of files I would do the man what honor I can but

of this I am not certain

Sir for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple

of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut th'

entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession

for it perpetually

E'en a crow o' th' same nest not altogether

so great as the first in goodness but greater a great

deal in evil He excels his brother for a coward yet

his brother is reputed one of the best that is In a

retreat he outruns any lackey Marry in coming on

he has the cramp

Ay and the captain of his horse Count

Rossillion

I'll no more drumming A plague of

all drums Only to seem to deserve well and to

beguile the supposition of that lascivious young

boy the Count have I run into this danger Yet who

would have suspected an ambush where I was

taken

O Lord sir let me live or let me see my

death

Who cannot be crushed with a plot

Yet am I thankful If my heart were great

'Twould burst at this Captain I'll be no more

But I will eat and drink and sleep as soft

As captain shall Simply the thing I am

Shall make me live Who knows himself a braggart

Let him fear this for it will come to pass

That every braggart shall be found an ass

Rust sword cool blushes and Parolles live

Safest in shame Being fooled by fool'ry thrive

There's place and means for every man alive

I'll after them

Good Monsieur

Lavatch give my lord Lafew this letter I have ere

now sir been better known to you when I have

held familiarity with fresher clothes But I am

now sir muddied in Fortune's mood and smell

somewhat strong of her strong displeasure

Nay you need not to stop your nose sir I

spake but by a metaphor

Pray you sir deliver me this paper

My lord I am a man whom Fortune hath

cruelly scratched

I beseech your Honor to hear me one single

word

My name my good lord is Parolles

O my good lord you were the first that

found me

It lies in you my lord to bring me in some

grace for you did bring me out

I praise God for you

So please your Majesty my master hath

been an honorable gentleman Tricks he hath had

in him which gentlemen have

Faith sir he did love her but how

He did love her sir as a gentleman loves a

woman

He loved her sir and loved her not

I am a poor man and at your Majesty's

command

Faith I know more than I'll speak

Yes so please your Majesty I did go

between them as I said but more than that he

loved her for indeed he was mad for her and

talked of Satan and of limbo and of furies and I

know not what Yet I was in that credit with them

at that time that I knew of their going to bed and

of other motions as promising her marriage and

things which would derive me ill will to speak of

Therefore I will not speak what I know
