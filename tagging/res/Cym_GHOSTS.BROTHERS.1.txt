In Britain where was he

That could stand up his parallel

Or fruitful object be

In eye of Imogen, that best

Could deem his dignity?

Like hardiment Posthumus hath

To Cymbeline performed.

Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,

Why hast thou thus adjourned

The graces for his merits due,

Being all to dolors turned?

Help, Jupiter, or we appeal

And from thy justice fly.

Thanks, Jupiter.
