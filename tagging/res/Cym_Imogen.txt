
O

Dissembling courtesy How fine this tyrant

Can tickle where she wounds My dearest husband

I something fear my father's wrath but nothing

Always reserved my holy dutywhat

His rage can do on me You must be gone

And I shall here abide the hourly shot

Of angry eyes not comforted to live

But that there is this jewel in the world

That I may see again

Nay stay a little

Were you but riding forth to air yourself

Such parting were too petty Look here love

This diamond was my mother'sTake it heart

But keep it till you woo another wife

When Imogen is dead

O the gods

When shall we see again

There cannot be a pinch in death

More sharp than this is

I beseech you sir

Harm not yourself with your vexation

I am senseless of your wrath A touch more rare

Subdues all pangs all fears

Past hope and in despair that way past grace

O blessd that I might not I chose an eagle

And did avoid a puttock

No I rather added

A luster to it

Sir

It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus

You bred him as my playfellow and he is

A man worth any woman overbuys me

Almost the sum he pays

Almost sir Heaven restore me Would I were

A neatherd's daughter and my Leonatus

Our neighbor shepherd's son

Your son's my father's friend he takes his part

To draw upon an exile O brave sir

I would they were in Afric both together

Myself by with a needle that I might prick

The goer-backWhy came you from your master

About some half hour hence

Pray you speak with me You shall at least

Go see my lord aboard For this time leave me

I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven

And questionedst every sail If he should write

And I not have it 'twere a paper lost

As offered mercy is What was the last

That he spake to thee

Then waved his handkerchief

Senseless linen happier therein than I

And that was all

Thou shouldst have made him

As little as a crow or less ere left

To after-eye him

I would have broke mine eyestrings cracked them but

To look upon him till the diminution

Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle

Nay followed him till he had melted from

The smallness of a gnat to air and then

Have turned mine eye and wept But good Pisanio

When shall we hear from him

I did not take my leave of him but had

Most pretty things to say Ere I could tell him

How I would think on him at certain hours

Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear

The shes of Italy should not betray

Mine interest and his honor or have charged him

At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight

T' encounter me with orisons for then

I am in heaven for him or ere I could

Give him that parting kiss which I had set

Betwixt two charming words comes in my father

And like the tyrannous breathing of the north

Shakes all our buds from growing

Those things I bid you do get them dispatched

I will attend the Queen

A father cruel and a stepdame false

A foolish suitor to a wedded lady

That hath her husband banished O that husband

My supreme crown of grief and those repeated

Vexations of it Had I been thief-stol'n

As my two brothers happy but most miserable

Is the desire that's glorious Blessed be those

How mean soe'er that have their honest wills

Which seasons comfort Who may this be Fie

Thanks good sir

You're kindly welcome

He is one of the noblest note to whose

kindnesses I am most infinitely tied Reflect upon

him accordingly as you value your trust

Leonatus

So far I read aloud

But even the very middle of my heart

Is warmed by th' rest and takes it thankfully

You are as welcome worthy sir as I

Have words to bid you and shall find it so

In all that I can do

What makes your admiration

What is the matter trow

What dear sir

Thus raps you Are you well

Continues well my lord His health beseech you

Is he disposed to mirth I hope he is

When he was here

He did incline to sadness and ofttimes

Not knowing why

Will my lord say so

Not he I hope

What do you pity sir

Am I one sir

You look on me What wrack discern you in me

Deserves your pity

I pray you sir

Deliver with more openness your answers

To my demands Why do you pity me

You do seem to know

Something of me or what concerns me Pray you

Since doubting things go ill often hurts more

Than to be sure they dofor certainties

Either are past remedies or timely knowing

The remedy then borndiscover to me

What both you spur and stop

My lord I fear

Has forgot Britain

Let me hear no more

Revenged

How should I be revenged If this be true

As I have such a heart that both mine ears

Must not in haste abuseif it be true

How should I be revenged

What ho Pisanio

Away I do condemn mine ears that have

So long attended thee If thou wert honorable

Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not

For such an end thou seek'st as base as strange

Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far

From thy report as thou from honor and

Solicits here a lady that disdains

Thee and the devil alikeWhat ho Pisanio

The King my father shall be made acquainted

Of thy assault If he shall think it fit

A saucy stranger in his court to mart

As in a Romish stew and to expound

His beastly mind to us he hath a court

He little cares for and a daughter who

He not respects at allWhat ho Pisanio

You make amends

All's well sir Take my power i' th' court for yours

Pray what is 't

Willingly

And pawn mine honor for their safety Since

My lord hath interest in them I will keep them

In my bedchamber

O no no

I thank you for your pains

But not away tomorrow

I will write

Send your trunk to me it shall safe be kept

And truly yielded you You're very welcome

Who's there My woman Helen

What hour is it

I have read three hours then Mine eyes are weak

Fold down the leaf where I have left To bed

Take not away the taper leave it burning

And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock

I prithee call me Sleep hath seized me wholly

To your protection I commend me gods

From fairies and the tempters of the night

Guard me beseech you

Good morrow sir You lay out too much pains

For purchasing but trouble The thanks I give

Is telling you that I am poor of thanks

And scarce can spare them

If you but said so 'twere as deep with me

If you swear still your recompense is still

That I regard it not

But that you shall not say I yield being silent

I would not speak I pray you spare me Faith

I shall unfold equal discourtesy

To your best kindness One of your great knowing

Should learn being taught forbearance

Fools are not mad folks

As I am mad I do

If you'll be patient I'll no more be mad

That cures us both I am much sorry sir

You put me to forget a lady's manners

By being so verbal and learn now for all

That I which know my heart do here pronounce

By th' very truth of it I care not for you

And am so near the lack of charity

To accuse myself I hate youwhich I had rather

You felt than make 't my boast

Profane fellow

Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more

But what thou art besides thou wert too base

To be his groom Thou wert dignified enough

Even to the point of envy if 'twere made

Comparative for your virtues to be styled

The under-hangman of his kingdom and hated

For being preferred so well

He never can meet more mischance than come

To be but named of thee His mean'st garment

That ever hath but clipped his body is dearer

In my respect than all the hairs above thee

Were they all made such menHow now Pisanio

To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently

I am sprighted with a fool

Frighted and angered worse Go bid my woman

Search for a jewel that too casually

Hath left mine arm It was thy master's Shrew me

If I would lose it for a revenue

Of any king's in Europe I do think

I saw 't this morning Confident I am

Last night 'twas on mine arm I kissed it

I hope it be not gone to tell my lord

That I kiss aught but he

I hope so Go and search

Ay I said so sir

If you will make 't an action call witness to 't

Your mother too

She's my good lady and will conceive I hope

But the worst of me So I leave you sir

To th' worst of discontent

How now Pisanio

Who thy lord that is my lord Leonatus

O learned indeed were that astronomer

That knew the stars as I his characters

He'd lay the future open You good gods

Let what is here contained relish of love

Of my lord's health of his content yet not

That we two are asunder let that grieve him

Some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them

For it doth physic love of his content

All but in that Good wax thy leave  Blest be

You bees that make these locks of counsel Lovers

And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike

Though forfeiters you cast in prison yet

You clasp young Cupid's tables Good news gods

Justice and your father's wrath should he

take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me

as you O the dearest of creatures would even renew

me with your eyes Take notice that I am in Cambria

at Milford Haven What your own love will out of

this advise you follow So he wishes you all happiness

that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing

in love

Leonatus Posthumus

O for a horse with wings Hear'st thou Pisanio

He is at Milford Haven Read and tell me

How far 'tis thither If one of mean affairs

May plod it in a week why may not I

Glide thither in a day Then true Pisanio

Who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st

O let me batebut not like me yet long'st

But in a fainter kindO not like me

For mine's beyond beyondsay and speak thick

Love's counselor should fill the bores of hearing

To th' smothering of the sensehow far it is

To this same blessd Milford And by th' way

Tell me how Wales was made so happy as

T' inherit such a haven But first of all

How we may steal from hence and for the gap

That we shall make in time from our hence-going

And our return to excuse But first how get hence

Why should excuse be born or ere begot

We'll talk of that hereafter Prithee speak

How many score of miles may we well rid

'Twixt hour and hour

Why one that rode to 's execution man

Could never go so slow I have heard of riding wagers

Where horses have been nimbler than the sands

That run i' th' clock's behalf But this is fool'ry

Go bid my woman feign a sickness say

She'll home to her father and provide me presently

A riding suit no costlier than would fit

A franklin's huswife

I see before me man Nor here nor here

Nor what ensues but have a fog in them

That I cannot look through Away I prithee

Do as I bid thee There's no more to say

Accessible is none but Milford way

Thou told'st me when we came from horse the place

Was near at hand Ne'er longed my mother so

To see me first as I have now Pisanio man

Where is Posthumus What is in thy mind

That makes thee stare thus Wherefore breaks that sigh

From th' inward of thee One but painted thus

Would be interpreted a thing perplexed

Beyond self-explication Put thyself

Into a havior of less fear ere wildness

Vanquish my staider senses What's the matter

Why tender'st thou that paper to me with

A look untender If 't be summer news

Smile to 't before if winterly thou need'st

But keep that count'nance still My husband's hand

That drug-damned Italy hath out-craftied him

And he's at some hard point Speak man Thy tongue

May take off some extremity which to read

Would be even mortal to me

Thy mistress Pisanio hath played the

strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lies

bleeding in me I speak not out of weak surmises but

from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I

expect my revenge That part thou Pisanio must act

for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of

hers Let thine own hands take away her life I shall

give thee opportunity at Milford Havenshe hath

my letter for the purposewhere if thou fear to

strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the

pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal

False to his bed What is it to be false

To lie in watch there and to think on him

To weep 'twixt clock and clock If sleep charge nature

To break it with a fearful dream of him

And cry myself awake That's false to 's bed is it

I false Thy conscience witness Iachimo

Thou didst accuse him of incontinency

Thou then looked'st like a villain Now methinks

Thy favor's good enough Some jay of Italy

Whose mother was her painting hath betrayed him

Poor I am stale a garment out of fashion

And for I am richer than to hang by th' walls

I must be ripped To pieces with me O

Men's vows are women's traitors All good seeming

By thy revolt O husband shall be thought

Put on for villainy not born where 't grows

But worn a bait for ladies

True honest men being heard like false Aeneas

Were in his time thought false and Sinon's weeping

Did scandal many a holy tear took pity

From most true wretchedness So thou Posthumus

Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men

Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured

From thy great failCome fellow be thou honest

Do thou thy master's bidding When thou seest him

A little witness my obedience Look

I draw the sword myself  Take it and hit

The innocent mansion of my love my heart

Fear not 'tis empty of all things but grief

Thy master is not there who was indeed

The riches of it Do his bidding strike

Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause

But now thou seem'st a coward

Why I must die

And if I do not by thy hand thou art

No servant of thy master's Against self-slaughter

There is a prohibition so divine

That cravens my weak hand Come here's my heart

Something's afore 't Soft soft We'll no defense

Obedient as the scabbard What is here

The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus

All turned to heresy Away away

Corrupters of my faith you shall no more

Be stomachers to my heart Thus may poor fools

Believe false teachers Though those that are betrayed

Do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor

Stands in worse case of woe And thou Posthumus

That didst set up

My disobedience 'gainst the King my father

And make me put into contempt the suits

Of princely fellows shalt hereafter find

It is no act of common passage but

A strain of rareness and I grieve myself

To think when thou shalt be disedged by her

That now thou tirest on how thy memory

Will then be panged by mePrithee dispatch

The lamb entreats the butcher Where's thy knife

Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding

When I desire it too

Do 't and to bed then

Wherefore then

Didst undertake it Why hast thou abused

So many miles with a pretense This place

Mine action and thine own Our horses' labor

The time inviting thee The perturbed court

For my being absent whereunto I never

Purpose return Why hast thou gone so far

To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand

Th' elected deer before thee

Talk thy tongue weary Speak

I have heard I am a strumpet and mine ear

Therein false struck can take no greater wound

Nor tent to bottom that But speak

Most like

Bringing me here to kill me

Some Roman courtesan

Why good fellow

What shall I do the while Where bide How live

Or in my life what comfort when I am

Dead to my husband

No court no father nor no more ado

With that harsh noble simple nothing

That Cloten whose love suit hath been to me

As fearful as a siege

Where then

Hath Britain all the sun that shines Day night

Are they not but in Britain I' th' world's volume

Our Britain seems as of it but not in 't

In a great pool a swan's nest Prithee think

There's livers out of Britain

O for such means

Though peril to my modesty not death on 't

I would adventure

Nay be brief

I see into thy end and am almost

A man already

Thou art all the comfort

The gods will diet me with Prithee away

There's more to be considered but we'll even

All that good time will give us This attempt

I am soldier to and will abide it with

A prince's courage Away I prithee

Amen I thank thee

I see a man's life is a tedious one

I have tired myself and for two nights together

Have made the ground my bed I should be sick

But that my resolution helps me Milford

When from the mountain top Pisanio showed thee

Thou wast within a ken O Jove I think

Foundations fly the wretchedsuch I mean

Where they should be relieved Two beggars told me

I could not miss my way Will poor folks lie

That have afflictions on them knowing 'tis

A punishment or trial Yes No wonder

When rich ones scarce tell true To lapse in fullness

Is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood

Is worse in kings than beggars My dear lord

Thou art one o' th' false ones Now I think on thee

My hunger's gone but even before I was

At point to sink for food But what is this

Here is a path to 't 'Tis some savage hold

I were best not call I dare not call Yet famine

Ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant

Plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever

Of hardiness is motherHo Who's here

If anything that's civil speak if savage

Take or lend HoNo answer Then I'll enter

Best draw my sword an if mine enemy

But fear the sword like me he'll scarcely look on 't

Such a foe good heavens

Good masters harm me not

Before I entered here I called and thought

To have begged or bought what I have took Good troth

I have stol'n naught nor would not though I had found

Gold strewed i' th' floor Here's money for my meat

I would have left it on the board so soon

As I had made my meal and parted

With prayers for the provider

I see you're angry

Know if you kill me for my fault I should

Have died had I not made it

To Milford Haven

Fidele sir I have a kinsman who

Is bound for Italy He embarked at Milford

To whom being going almost spent with hunger

I am fall'n in this offense

'Mongst friends

If brothersWould it had been so that they

Had been my father's sons Then had my prize

Been less and so more equal ballasting

To thee Posthumus

Great men

That had a court no bigger than this cave

That did attend themselves and had the virtue

Which their own conscience sealed them laying by

That nothing-gift of differing multitudes

Could not outpeer these twain Pardon me gods

I'd change my sex to be companion with them

Since Leonatus false

Thanks sir

So man and man should be

But clay and clay differs in dignity

Whose dust is both alike I am very sick

So sick I am not yet I am not well

But not so citizen a wanton as

To seem to die ere sick So please you leave me

Stick to your journal course The breach of custom

Is breach of all I am ill but your being by me

Cannot amend me Society is no comfort

To one not sociable I am not very sick

Since I can reason of it Pray you trust me here

I'll rob none but myselfand let me die

Stealing so poorly

I wish you sport

These are kind creatures Gods what lies I have heard

Our courtiers say all's savage but at court

Experience O thou disprov'st report

Th' imperious seas breeds monsters for the dish

Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish

I am sick still heart-sick Pisanio

I'll now taste of thy drug

Well or ill

I am bound to you

Yes sir to Milford Haven Which is the way

I thank you By yond bush Pray how far thither

Ods pittikins can it be six mile yet

I have gone all night Faith I'll lie down and sleep

But soft No bedfellow O gods and goddesses

These flowers are like the pleasures of the world

This bloody man the care on 't I hope I dream

For so I thought I was a cave-keeper

And cook to honest creatures But 'tis not so

'Twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing

Which the brain makes of fumes Our very eyes

Are sometimes like our judgments blind Good faith

I tremble still with fear but if there be

Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity

As a wren's eye feared gods a part of it

The dream's here still Even when I wake it is

Without me as within me not imagined felt

A headless man The garments of Posthumus

I know the shape of 's leg This is his hand

His foot Mercurial his Martial thigh

The brawns of Hercules but his Jovial face

Murder in heaven How 'Tis gone Pisanio

All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks

And mine to boot be darted on thee Thou

Conspired with that irregulous devil Cloten

Hath here cut off my lord To write and read

Be henceforth treacherous Damned Pisanio

Hath with his forgd lettersdamned Pisanio

From this most bravest vessel of the world

Struck the maintop O Posthumus alas

Where is thy head Where's that Ay me where's that

Pisanio might have killed thee at the heart

And left this head on How should this be Pisanio

'Tis he and Cloten Malice and lucre in them

Have laid this woe here O 'tis pregnant pregnant

The drug he gave me which he said was precious

And cordial to me have I not found it

Murd'rous to th' senses That confirms it home

This is Pisanio's deed and Cloten O

Give color to my pale cheek with thy blood

That we the horrider may seem to those

Which chance to find us O my lord My lord

I am nothing or if not

Nothing to be were better This was my master

A very valiant Briton and a good

That here by mountaineers lies slain Alas

There is no more such masters I may wander

From east to occident cry out for service

Try many all good serve truly never

Find such another master

Richard du Champ If I do lie and do

No harm by it though the gods hear I hope

They'll pardon itSay you sir

Fidele sir

I'll follow sir But first an 't please the gods

I'll hide my master from the flies as deep

As these poor pickaxes can dig and when

With wild-wood leaves and weeds I ha' strewed his grave

And on it said a century of prayers

Such as I can twice o'er I'll weep and sigh

And leaving so his service follow you

So please you entertain me

I humbly thank your Highness

No no alack

There's other work in hand I see a thing

Bitter to me as death Your life good master

Must shuffle for itself

He is a Roman no more kin to me

Than I to your Highness who being born your vassal

Am something nearer

I'll tell you sir in private if you please

To give me hearing

Fidele sir

My boon is that this gentleman may render

Of whom he had this ring

Peace my lord Hear hear

O get thee from my sight

Thou gav'st me poison Dangerous fellow hence

Breathe not where princes are

It poisoned me

Most like I did for I was dead

Why did you throw your wedded lady from you

Think that you are upon a rock and now

Throw me again

Your blessing sir

I am sorry for 't my lord

That headless man

I thought had been my lord

No my lord

I have got two worlds by 'tO my gentle brothers

Have we thus met O never say hereafter

But I am truest speaker You called me brother

When I was but your sister I you brothers

When we were so indeed

You are my father too and did relieve me

To see this gracious season

My good master

I will yet do you service
