


If music be the food of love play on

Give me excess of it that surfeiting

The appetite may sicken and so die

That strain again It had a dying fall

O it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound

That breathes upon a bank of violets

Stealing and giving odor Enough no more

'Tis not so sweet now as it was before

O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou

That notwithstanding thy capacity

Receiveth as the sea naught enters there

Of what validity and pitch soe'er

But falls into abatement and low price

Even in a minute So full of shapes is fancy

That it alone is high fantastical

What Curio

Why so I do the noblest that I have

O when mine eyes did see Olivia first

Methought she purged the air of pestilence

That instant was I turned into a hart

And my desires like fell and cruel hounds

E'er since pursue me    How now what news from her

O she that hath a heart of that fine frame

To pay this debt of love but to a brother

How will she love when the rich golden shaft

Hath killed the flock of all affections else

That live in her when liver brain and heart

These sovereign thrones are all supplied and filled

Her sweet perfections with one self king

Away before me to sweet beds of flowers

Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers

Who saw Cesario ho

Stand you awhile aloofCesario

Thou know'st no less but all I have unclasped

To thee the book even of my secret soul

Therefore good youth address thy gait unto her

Be not denied access Stand at her doors

And tell them there thy fixd foot shall grow

Till thou have audience

Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds

Rather than make unprofited return

O then unfold the passion of my love

Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith

It shall become thee well to act my woes

She will attend it better in thy youth

Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect

Dear lad believe it

For they shall yet belie thy happy years

That say thou art a man Diana's lip

Is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe

Is as the maiden's organ shrill and sound

And all is semblative a womans part

I know thy constellation is right apt

For this affairSome four or five attend him

All if you will for I myself am best

When least in companyProsper well in this

And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord

To call his fortunes thine

Give me some music Now good morrow friends

Now good Cesario but that piece of song

That old and antique song we heard last night

Methought it did relieve my passion much

More than light airs and recollected terms

Of these most brisk and giddy-pacd times

Come but one verse

Who was it

Seek him out and play the tune the while

Come hither boy If ever thou shalt love

In the sweet pangs of it remember me

For such as I am all true lovers are

Unstaid and skittish in all motions else

Save in the constant image of the creature

That is beloved How dost thou like this tune

Thou dost speak masterly

My life upon 't young though thou art thine eye

Hath stayed upon some favor that it loves

Hath it not boy

What kind of woman is 't

She is not worth thee then What years i' faith

Too old by heaven Let still the woman take

An elder than herself So wears she to him

So sways she level in her husband's heart

For boy however we do praise ourselves

Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm

More longing wavering sooner lost and worn

Than women's are

Then let thy love be younger than thyself

Or thy affection cannot hold the bent

For women are as roses whose fair flower

Being once displayed doth fall that very hour

O fellow come the song we had last night

Mark it Cesario It is old and plain

The spinsters and the knitters in the sun

And the free maids that weave their thread with bones

Do use to chant it It is silly sooth

And dallies with the innocence of love

Like the old age

Ay prithee sing

There's for thy pains

I'll pay thy pleasure then

Give me now leave to leave thee

Let all the rest give place  Once more Cesario

Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty

Tell her my love more noble than the world

Prizes not quantity of dirty lands

The parts that Fortune hath bestowed upon her

Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune

But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems

That nature pranks her in attracts my soul

I cannot be so answered

There is no woman's sides

Can bide the beating of so strong a passion

As love doth give my heart no woman's heart

So big to hold so much they lack retention

Alas their love may be called appetite

No motion of the liver but the palate

That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt

But mine is all as hungry as the sea

And can digest as much Make no compare

Between that love a woman can bear me

And that I owe Olivia

What dost thou know

And what's her history

But died thy sister of her love my boy

Ay that's the theme

To her in haste Give her this jewel Say

My love can give no place bide no denay

Belong you to the Lady Olivia friends

I know thee well How dost thou my good fellow

Just the contrary the better for thy friends

How can that be

Why this is excellent

Thou shalt not be the worse for me there's gold

O you give me ill counsel

Well I will be so much a sinner to be a

double-dealer there's another

You can fool no more money out of me at this

throw If you will let your lady know I am here to

speak with her and bring her along with you it

may awake my bounty further

That face of his I do remember well

Yet when I saw it last it was besmeared

As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war

A baubling vessel was he captain of

For shallow draught and bulk unprizable

With which such scatheful grapple did he make

With the most noble bottom of our fleet

That very envy and the tongue of loss

Cried fame and honor on himWhat's the matter

Notable pirate thou saltwater thief

What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies

Whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear

Hast made thine enemies

When came he to this town

Here comes the Countess Now heaven walks on Earth

But for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness

Three months this youth hath tended upon me

But more of that anon Take him aside

Gracious Olivia

Still so cruel

What to perverseness You uncivil lady

To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars

My soul the faithful'st off'rings have breathed out

That e'er devotion tenderedwhat shall I do

Why should I not had I the heart to do it

Like to th' Egyptian thief at point of death

Kill what I lovea savage jealousy

That sometime savors nobly But hear me this

Since you to nonregardance cast my faith

And that I partly know the instrument

That screws me from my true place in your favor

Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still

But this your minion whom I know you love

And whom by heaven I swear I tender dearly

Him will I tear out of that cruel eye

Where he sits crownd in his master's spite

Come boy with me My thoughts are ripe in mischief

I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love

To spite a raven's heart within a dove

Come away

Husband

Her husband sirrah

O thou dissembling cub What wilt thou be

When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case

Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow

That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow

Farewell and take her but direct thy feet

Where thou and I henceforth may never meet

My gentleman Cesario

How now gentleman How is 't with you

One face one voice one habit and two persons

A natural perspective that is and is not

Be not amazed right noble is his blood

If this be so as yet the glass seems true

I shall have share in this most happy wrack

Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times

Thou never shouldst love woman like to me

Give me thy hand

And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds

This savors not much of distraction

Madam I am most apt t' embrace your offer

Your master quits you and for your service done him

So much against the mettle of your sex

So far beneath your soft and tender breeding

And since you called me master for so long

Here is my hand You shall from this time be

Your master's mistress

Is this the madman

Pursue him and entreat him to a peace

He hath not told us of the Captain yet

When that is known and golden time convents

A solemn combination shall be made

Of our dear soulsMeantime sweet sister

We will not part from henceCesario come

For so you shall be while you are a man

But when in other habits you are seen

Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen
