Now darting Parthia art thou struck and now

Pleased Fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death

Make me revenger Bear the King's son's body

Before our army Thy Pacorus Orodes

Pays this for Marcus Crassus

O Silius Silius

I have done enough A lower place note well

May make too great an act For learn this Silius

Better to leave undone than by our deed

Acquire too high a fame when him we serve 's away

Caesar and Antony have ever won

More in their officer than person Sossius

One of my place in Syria his lieutenant

For quick accumulation of renown

Which he achieved by th' minute lost his favor

Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can

Becomes his captain's captain and ambition

The soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss

Than gain which darkens him

I could do more to do Antonius good

But 'twould offend him And in his offense

Should my performance perish

I'll humbly signify what in his name

That magical word of war we have effected

How with his banners and his well-paid ranks

The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia

We have jaded out o' th' field

He purposeth to Athens whither with what haste

The weight we must convey with 's will permit

We shall appear before himOn there pass along
