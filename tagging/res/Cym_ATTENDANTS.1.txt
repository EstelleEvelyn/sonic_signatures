


You do not meet a man but frowns Our bloods

No more obey the heavens than our courtiers'

Still seem as does the King's

His daughter and the heir of 's kingdom whom

He purposed to his wife's sole sona widow

That late he marriedhath referred herself

Unto a poor but worthy gentleman She's wedded

Her husband banished she imprisoned All

Is outward sorrow though I think the King

Be touched at very heart

He that hath lost her too So is the Queen

That most desired the match But not a courtier

Although they wear their faces to the bent

Of the King's looks hath a heart that is not

Glad at the thing they scowl at

He that hath missed the Princess is a thing

Too bad for bad report and he that hath her

I mean that married her alack good man

And therefore banishedis a creature such

As to seek through the regions of the Earth

For one his like there would be something failing

In him that should compare I do not think

So fair an outward and such stuff within

Endows a man but he

I do extend him sir within himself

Crush him together rather than unfold

His measure duly

I cannot delve him to the root His father

Was called Sicilius who did join his honor

Against the Romans with Cassibelan

But had his titles by Tenantius whom

He served with glory and admired success

So gained the sur-addition Leonatus

And had besides this gentleman in question

Two other sons who in the wars o' th' time

Died with their swords in hand For which their father

Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow

That he quit being and his gentle lady

Big of this gentleman our theme deceased

As he was born The King he takes the babe

To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus

Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber

Puts to him all the learnings that his time

Could make him the receiver of which he took

As we do air fast as 'twas ministered

And in 's spring became a harvest lived in court

Which rare it is to domost praised most loved

A sample to the youngest to th' more mature

A glass that feated them and to the graver

A child that guided dotards To his mistress

For whom he now is banished her own price

Proclaims how she esteemed him and his virtue

By her election may be truly read

What kind of man he is

His only child

He had two sonsif this be worth your hearing

Mark itthe eldest of them at three years old

I' th' swathing clothes the other from their nursery

Were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge

Which way they went

Some twenty years

Howsoe'er 'tis strange

Or that the negligence may well be laughed at

Yet is it true sir

We must forbear Here comes the gentleman

The Queen and Princess
