


We are my lord and come to have the warrant

That we may be admitted where he is

Tut tut my lord we will not stand to prate

Talkers are no good doers Be assured

We go to use our hands and not our tongues

We will my noble lord

Ho who's here

'Tis better sir than to be tedious

Let him see our commission and talk no more

You may sir 'Tis a point of wisdom

Fare you well

No He'll say 'twas done cowardly

when he wakes

Why then he'll say we stabbed him

sleeping

What art thou afraid

I thought thou hadst been resolute

I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester

and tell him so

How dost thou feel thyself now

Remember our reward when the

deed's done

Where's thy conscience now

When he opens his purse to give us

our reward thy conscience flies out

What if it come to thee again

Zounds 'tis even now at my elbow

persuading me not to kill the Duke

I am strong-framed He cannot prevail

with me

Take him on the costard with the

hilts of thy sword and then throw him into the

malmsey butt in the next room

Soft he wakes

No we'll reason with him

A man as you are

Nor you as we are loyal

My voice is now the King's my looks mine own

Ay ay

Offended us you have not but the King

What we will do we do upon command

And like a traitor to the name of God

Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade

Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign's son

How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us

When thou hast broke it in such dear degree

Who made thee then a bloody minister

When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet

That princely novice was struck dead by thee

Thy brother's love our duty and thy faults

Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee

Ay so we will

Ay millstones as he lessoned us to weep

Right as snow in harvest Come you deceive yourself

'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here

Why so he doth when he delivers you

From this Earth's thralldom to the joys of heaven

Relent No 'Tis cowardly and womanish

Take that and that If all this will not do

I'll drown you in the malmsey butt within

How now What mean'st thou that thou help'st me not

By heavens the Duke shall know how slack you have been

So do not I Go coward as thou art

Well I'll go hide the body in some hole

Till that the Duke give order for his burial

And when I have my meed I will away

For this will out and then I must not stay
