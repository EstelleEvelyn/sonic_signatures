


Mars his true moving even as in the heavens

So in the Earth to this day is not known

Late did he shine upon the English side

Now we are victors upon us he smiles

What towns of any moment but we have

At pleasure here we lie near Orleance

Otherwhiles the famished English like pale ghosts

Faintly besiege us one hour in a month

Sound sound alarum We will rush on them

Now for the honor of the forlorn French

Him I forgive my death that killeth me

When he sees me go back one foot or fly

Whoever saw the like What men have I

Dogs cowards dastards I would ne'er have fled

But that they left me 'midst my enemies

Let's leave this town for they are hare-brained slaves

And hunger will enforce them to be more eager

Of old I know them rather with their teeth

The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege

Bastard of Orleance thrice welcome to us

Go call her in But first to try her skill

Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place

Question her proudly let thy looks be stern

By this means shall we sound what skill she hath

Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms

Only this proof I'll of thy valor make

In single combat thou shalt buckle with me

And if thou vanquishest thy words are true

Otherwise I renounce all confidence

Then come a' God's name I fear no woman

Stay stay thy hands Thou art an Amazon

And fightest with the sword of Deborah

Whoe'er helps thee 'tis thou that must help me

Impatiently I burn with thy desire

My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued

Excellent Pucelle if thy name be so

Let me thy servant and not sovereign be

'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus

Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall

What she says I'll confirm we'll fight it out

Was Mahomet inspird with a dove

Thou with an eagle art inspird then

Helen the mother of great Constantine

Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters were like thee

Bright star of Venus fall'n down on the Earth

How may I reverently worship thee enough

Presently we'll try Come let's away about it

No prophet will I trust if she prove false

Divinest creature Astraea's daughter

How shall I honor thee for this success

Thy promises are like Adonis' garden

That one day bloomed and fruitful were the next

France triumph in thy glorious prophetess

Recovered is the town of Orleance

More blessd hap did ne'er befall our state

'Tis Joan not we by whom the day is won

For which I will divide my crown with her

And all the priests and friars in my realm

Shall in procession sing her endless praise

A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear

Than Rhodophe's of Memphis ever was

In memory of her when she is dead

Her ashes in an urn more precious

Than the rich-jeweled coffer of Darius

Transported shall be at high festivals

Before the kings and queens of France

No longer on Saint Dennis will we cry

But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint

Come in and let us banquet royally

After this golden day of victory

Is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame

Didst thou at first to flatter us withal

Make us partakers of a little gain

That now our loss might be ten times so much

Duke of Alanson this was your default

That being captain of the watch tonight

Did look no better to that weighty charge

And for myself most part of all this night

Within her quarter and mine own precinct

I was employed in passing to and fro

About relieving of the sentinels

Then how or which way should they first break in

Saint Dennis bless this happy stratagem

And once again we'll sleep secure in Roan

Now shine it like a comet of revenge

A prophet to the fall of all our foes

Your Grace may starve perhaps before that time

We have been guided by thee hitherto

And of thy cunning had no diffidence

One sudden foil shall never breed distrust

Ay marry sweeting if we could do that

France were no place for Henry's warriors

Nor should that nation boast it so with us

But be extirpd from our provinces

A parley with the Duke of Burgundy

Speak Pucelle and enchant him with thy words

Welcome brave duke Thy friendship makes us fresh

Now let us on my lords and join our powers

And seek how we may prejudice the foe

Had York and Somerset brought rescue in

We should have found a bloody day of this

O no forbear For that which we have fled

During the life let us not wrong it dead

On what submissive message art thou sent

For prisoners askst thou Hell our prison is

But tell me whom thou seek'st

Go take their bodies hence

So we be rid of them do with him what thou wilt

And now to Paris in this conquering vein

All will be ours now bloody Talbot's slain

These news my lords may cheer our drooping spirits

'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt

And turn again unto the warlike French

What tidings send our scouts I prithee speak

Somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is

But we will presently provide for them

Then on my lords and France be fortunate

Since lords of England it is thus agreed

That peaceful truce shall be proclaimed in France

We come to be informd by yourselves

What the conditions of that league must be

'Tis known already that I am possessed

With more than half the Gallian territories

And therein reverenced for their lawful king

Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquished

Detract so much from that prerogative

As to be called but viceroy of the whole

No lord ambassador I'll rather keep

That which I have than coveting for more

Be cast from possibility of all

It shallonly reserved you claim no interest

In any of our towns of garrison
