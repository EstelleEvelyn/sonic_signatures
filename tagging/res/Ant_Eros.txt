


There's strange news come sir

Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon

Pompey

Caesar having made use of him in the wars

'gainst Pompey presently denied him rivality

would not let him partake in the glory of the action

and not resting here accuses him of letters he had

formerly wrote to Pompey upon his own appeal

seizes him So the poor third is up till death enlarge

his confine

He's walking in the garden thus and spurns

The rush that lies before him cries Fool Lepidus

And threats the throat of that his officer

That murdered Pompey

For Italy and Caesar More Domitius

My lord desires you presently My news

I might have told hereafter

Come sir

Nay gentle madam to him comfort him

See you here sir

Sir sir

The Queen my lord the Queen

Most noble sir arise The Queen approaches

Her head's declined and death will seize her but

Your comfort makes the rescue

Sir the Queen

Briefly sir

Sir his chests and treasure

He has not with him

They are beaten sir and our advantage serves

For a fair victory

Ay noble lord

Ay my lord

It does my lord

What would my lord

The gods withhold me

Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts

Though enemy lost aim and could not

I would not see 't

O sir pardon me

Turn from me then that noble countenance

Wherein the worship of the whole world lies

My sword is drawn

My dear master

My captain and my emperor let me say

Before I strike this bloody stroke farewell

Farewell great chief Shall I strike now

Why there then Thus I do escape the sorrow

Of Antony's death
