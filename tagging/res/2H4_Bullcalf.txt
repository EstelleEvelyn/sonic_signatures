O Lord good my lord captain

O Lord sir I am a diseased man

A whoreson cold sir a cough sir which I

caught with ringing in the King's affairs upon his

coronation day sir

Good Master Corporate Bardolph stand my

friend and here's four Harry ten-shillings in

French crowns for you

In very truth sir I had as lief be hanged sir as go

And yet for mine own part sir I do not care but

rather because I am unwilling and for mine own

part have a desire to stay with my friends Else sir

I did not care for mine own part so much
