
Agamemnon,

Thou great commander, nerves and bone of Greece,

Heart of our numbers, soul and only sprite,

In whom the tempers and the minds of all

Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.

Besides th’ applause and approbation,

The which, most mighty for thy place and sway,

And thou most reverend for thy stretched-out life,

I give to both your speeches, which were such

As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece

Should hold up high in brass; and such again

As venerable Nestor, hatched in silver,

Should with a bond of air, strong as the axletree

On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears

To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,

Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.

Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,

And the great Hector’s sword had lacked a master

But for these instances:

The specialty of rule hath been neglected,

And look how many Grecian tents do stand

Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.

When that the general is not like the hive

To whom the foragers shall all repair,

What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,

Th’ unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.

The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center

Observe degree, priority, and place,

Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,

Office, and custom, in all line of order.

And therefore is the glorious planet Sol

In noble eminence enthroned and sphered

Amidst the other, whose med’cinable eye

Corrects the influence of evil planets,

And posts, like the commandment of a king,

Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets

In evil mixture to disorder wander,

What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,

What raging of the sea, shaking of Earth,

Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors

Divert and crack, rend and deracinate

The unity and married calm of states

Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shaked,

Which is the ladder of all high designs,

The enterprise is sick. How could communities,

Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,

Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,

The primogeneity and due of birth,

Prerogative of age, crowns, scepters, laurels,

But by degree stand in authentic place?

Take but degree away, untune that string,

And hark what discord follows. Each thing meets

In mere oppugnancy. The bounded waters

Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores

And make a sop of all this solid globe;

Strength should be lord of imbecility,

And the rude son should strike his father dead;

Force should be right, or, rather, right and wrong,

Between whose endless jar justice resides,

Should lose their names, and so should justice too.

Then everything includes itself in power,

Power into will, will into appetite,

And appetite, an universal wolf,

So doubly seconded with will and power,

Must make perforce an universal prey

And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,

This chaos, when degree is suffocate,

Follows the choking.

And this neglection of degree it is

That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose

It hath to climb. The General’s disdained

By him one step below, he by the next,

That next by him beneath; so every step,

Exampled by the first pace that is sick

Of his superior, grows to an envious fever

Of pale and bloodless emulation.

And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,

Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,

Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.

The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns

The sinew and the forehand of our host,

Having his ear full of his airy fame,

Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent

Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus,

Upon a lazy bed, the live-long day

Breaks scurril jests,

And with ridiculous and silly action,

Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,

He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,

Thy topless deputation he puts on,

And, like a strutting player whose conceit

Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich

To hear the wooden dialogue and sound

’Twixt his stretched footing and the scaffollage,

Such to-be-pitied and o’erwrested seeming

He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,

’Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquared

Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropped

Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff,

The large Achilles, on his pressed bed lolling,

From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,

Cries “Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right.

Now play me Nestor; hem and stroke thy beard,

As he being dressed to some oration.”

That’s done, as near as the extremest ends

Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;

Yet god Achilles still cries “Excellent!

’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,

Arming to answer in a night alarm.”

And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age

Must be the scene of mirth—to cough and spit,

And, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,

Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport

Sir Valor dies, cries “O, enough, Patroclus,

Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all

In pleasure of my spleen.” And in this fashion,

All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,

Severals and generals of grace exact,

Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,

Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,

Success or loss, what is or is not, serves

As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.

They tax our policy and call it cowardice,

Count wisdom as no member of the war,

Forestall prescience, and esteem no act

But that of hand. The still and mental parts

That do contrive how many hands shall strike

When fitness calls them on and know by measure

Of their observant toil the enemy’s weight—

Why, this hath not a fingers dignity.

They call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet war;

So that the ram that batters down the wall,

For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,

They place before his hand that made the engine

Or those that with the fineness of their souls

By reason guide his execution.

Amen.

Nestor.

I have a young conception in my brain;

Be you my time to bring it to some shape.

This ’tis:

Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride

That hath to this maturity blown up

In rank Achilles must or now be cropped

Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil

To overbulk us all.

This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,

However it is spread in general name,

Relates in purpose only to Achilles.

And wake him to the answer, think you?

Give pardon to my speech: therefore ’tis meet

Achilles meet not Hector. Let us like merchants

First show foul wares and think perchance they’ll sell;

If not, the luster of the better shall exceed

By showing the worse first. Do not consent

That ever Hector and Achilles meet,

For both our honor and our shame in this

Are dogged with two strange followers.

What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,

Were he not proud, we all should share with him;

But he already is too insolent,

And it were better parch in Afric sun

Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes

Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foiled,

Why then we do our main opinion crush

In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,

And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw

The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves

Give him allowance for the better man,

For that will physic the great Myrmidon,

Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall

His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.

If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,

We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,

Yet go we under our opinion still

That we have better men. But, hit or miss,

Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes:

Ajax employed plucks down Achilles’ plumes.

We saw him at the opening of his tent.

He is not sick.

Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.

He.

No. You see, he is his argument that has his

argument: Achilles.

The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may

easily untie.

Here comes Patroclus.

The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy;

his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.

Achilles will not to the field tomorrow.

He doth rely on none,

But carries on the stream of his dispose,

Without observance or respect of any,

In will peculiar and in self-admission.

Things small as nothing, for request’s sake only,

He makes important. Possessed he is with greatness

And speaks not to himself but with a pride

That quarrels at self-breath. Imagined worth

Holds in his blood such swoll’n and hot discourse

That ’twixt his mental and his active parts

Kingdomed Achilles in commotion rages

And batters down himself. What should I say?

He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it

Cry “No recovery.”

O Agamemnon, let it not be so!

We’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes

When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord

That bastes his arrogance with his own seam

And never suffers matter of the world

Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve

And ruminate himself—shall he be worshipped

Of that we hold an idol more than he?

No. This thrice-worthy and right valiant lord

Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,

Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,

As amply titled as Achilles is,

By going to Achilles.

That were to enlard his fat-already pride

And add more coals to Cancer when he burns

With entertaining great Hyperion.

This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid

And say in thunder “Achilles, go to him.”

Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.

The raven chides blackness.

Wit would be out of fashion.

He would have ten shares.

My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.

Why, ’tis this naming of him does him harm.

Here is a man—but ’tis before his face;

I will be silent.

Know the whole world, he is as valiant—

If he were proud—

Ay, or surly borne—

Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure.

Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;

Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature

Thrice famed beyond, beyond thy erudition;

But he that disciplined thine arms to fight,

Let Mars divide eternity in twain

And give him half; and for thy vigor,

Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield

To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,

Which like a bourn, a pale, a shore confines

Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,

Instructed by the antiquary times;

He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.—

But pardon, father Nestor, were your days

As green as Ajax’ and your brain so tempered,

You should not have the eminence of him,

But be as Ajax.

There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles

Keeps thicket. Please it our great general

To call together all his state of war.

Fresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow

We must with all our main of power stand fast.

And here’s a lord—come knights from east to west

And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.

Achilles stands i’ th’ entrance of his tent.

Please it our General pass strangely by him

As if he were forgot, and, princes all,

Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.

I will come last. ’Tis like he’ll question me

Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turned on him.

If so, I have derision medicinable

To use between your strangeness and his pride,

Which his own will shall have desire to drink.

It may do good; pride hath no other glass

To show itself but pride, for supple knees

Feed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees.

Now, great Thetis’ son—

A strange fellow here

Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,

How much in having, or without or in,

Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,

Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;

As when his virtues, shining upon others,

Heat them, and they retort that heat again

To the first giver.

I do not strain at the position—

It is familiar—but at the author’s drift,

Who in his circumstance expressly proves

That no man is the lord of anything—

Though in and of him there be much consisting—

Till he communicate his parts to others;

Nor doth he of himself know them for aught

Till he behold them formed in the applause

Where they’re extended; who, like an arch, reverb’rate

The voice again or, like a gate of steel

Fronting the sun, receives and renders back

His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this

And apprehended here immediately

Th’ unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!

A very horse, that has he knows not what!

Nature, what things there are

Most abject in regard, and dear in use,

What things again most dear in the esteem

And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow—

An act that very chance doth throw upon him—

Ajax renowned. O, heavens, what some men do

While some men leave to do!

How some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,

Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!

How one man eats into another’s pride,

While pride is fasting in his wantonness!

To see these Grecian lords—why, even already

They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder

As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast

And great Troy shrieking.

Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back

Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,

A great-sized monster of ingratitudes.

Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devoured

As fast as they are made, forgot as soon

As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,

Keeps honor bright. To have done is to hang

Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail

In monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way,

For honor travels in a strait so narrow

Where one but goes abreast. Keep, then, the path,

For Emulation hath a thousand sons

That one by one pursue. If you give way

Or turn aside from the direct forthright,

Like to an entered tide they all rush by

And leave you hindmost;

Or, like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,

Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,

O’errun and trampled on. Then what they do in present,

Though less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours;

For Time is like a fashionable host

That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand

And, with his arms outstretched as he would fly,

Grasps in the comer. Welcome ever smiles,

And Farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek

Remuneration for the thing it was,

For beauty, wit,

High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,

Love, friendship, charity are subjects all

To envious and calumniating Time.

One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,

That all, with one consent, praise newborn gauds,

Though they are made and molded of things past,

And give to dust that is a little gilt

More laud than gilt o’erdusted.

The present eye praises the present object.

Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,

That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,

Since things in motion sooner catch the eye

Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,

And still it might, and yet it may again,

If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive

And case thy reputation in thy tent,

Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late

Made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves

And drave great Mars to faction.

But ’gainst your privacy

The reasons are more potent and heroical.

’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love

With one of Priam’s daughters.

Is that a wonder?

The providence that’s in a watchful state

Knows almost every grain of Pluto’s gold,

Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep,

Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,

Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.

There is a mystery—with whom relation

Durst never meddle—in the soul of state,

Which hath an operation more divine

Than breath or pen can give expressure to.

All the commerce that you have had with Troy

As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;

And better would it fit Achilles much

To throw down Hector than Polyxena.

But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home

When Fame shall in our islands sound her trump,

And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing

“Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win,

But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.”

Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.

The fool slides o’er the ice that you should break.

No trumpet answers.

’Tis he. I ken the manner of his gait.

He rises on the toe; that spirit of his

In aspiration lifts him from the earth.

Yet is the kindness but particular.

’Twere better she were kissed in general.

O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns,

For which we lose our heads to gild his horns!

It were no match, your nail against his horn.

May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?

I do desire it.

Why, then, for Venus’ sake, give me a kiss

When Helen is a maid again and his.

Never’s my day, and then a kiss of you.

Fie, fie upon her!

There’s language in her eye, her cheek, her lip;

Nay, her foot speaks. Her wanton spirits look out

At every joint and motive of her body.

O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,

That give accosting welcome ere it comes

And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts

To every tickling reader! Set them down

For sluttish spoils of opportunity

And daughters of the game.

The Trojan’s trumpet.

They are opposed already.

The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,

Not yet mature, yet matchless firm of word,

Speaking in deeds, and deedless in his tongue,

Not soon provoked, nor being provoked soon calmed,

His heart and hand both open and both free.

For what he has, he gives; what thinks, he shows;

Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,

Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;

Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,

For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes

To tender objects, but he in heat of action

Is more vindicative than jealous love.

They call him Troilus, and on him erect

A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.

Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth

Even to his inches, and with private soul

Did in great Ilium thus translate him to me.

I wonder now how yonder city stands

When we have here her base and pillar by us.

Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.

My prophecy is but half his journey yet,

For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,

Yon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,

Must kiss their own feet.

So to him we leave it.

Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome.

After the General, I beseech you next

To feast with me and see me at my tent.

At Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus.

There Diomed doth feast with him tonight,

Who neither looks upon the heaven nor Earth,

But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view

On the fair Cressid.

You shall command me, sir.

As gentle tell me, of what honor was

This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there

That wails her absence?

Here comes himself to guide you.

Follow his torch; he goes to Calchas’ tent.

I’ll keep you company.

Stand where the torch may not discover us.

She will sing any man at

first sight.

List!

How now, Trojan?

You are moved, prince. Let us depart, I pray you,

Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself

To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous;

The time right deadly. I beseech you, go.

Nay, good my lord, go off.

You flow to great distraction. Come, my lord.

You have not patience. Come.

How now, my lord?

You shake, my lord, at something. Will you go?

You will break out.

Come, come.

You have sworn patience.

My lord—

All’s done, my lord.

Why stay we then?

I cannot conjure, Trojan.

Most sure she was.

Nor mine, my lord. Cressid was here but now.

What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?

May worthy Troilus be half attached

With that which here his passion doth express?

O, contain yourself.

Your passion draws ears hither.

I’ll bring you to the gates.

O, courage, courage, princes! Great Achilles

Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.

Patroclus’ wounds have roused his drowsy blood,

Together with his mangled Myrmidons,

That noseless, handless, hacked and chipped, come to him,

Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend

And foams at mouth, and he is armed and at it,

Roaring for Troilus, who hath done today

Mad and fantastic execution,

Engaging and redeeming of himself

With such a careless force and forceless care

As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,

Bade him win all.
