


I am resolved 'Tis but a three years' fast

The mind shall banquet though the body pine

Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits

Make rich the ribs but bankrout quite the wits

You swore to that Berowne and to the rest

He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding

Four days ago

Marry that did I

To fright them hence with that dread penalty

Costard the swain and he shall be our sport

And so to study three years is but short

A high hope for a low heaven God grant

us patience

To hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately

or to forbear both

I beseech you a word What is she in the white

Perchance light in the light I desire her name

Pray you sir whose daughter

God's blessing on your beard

Nay my choler is ended She is a most

sweet lady

Ay me I am forsworn

Am I the first that have been perjured so

I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move

O sweet Maria empress of my love

These numbers will I tear and write in prose

This same shall go

Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye

'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument

Persuade my heart to this false perjury

Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment

A woman I forswore but I will prove

Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee

My vow was earthly thou a heavenly love

Thy grace being gained cures all disgrace in me

Vows are but breath and breath a vapor is

Then thou fair sun which on my Earth dost shine

Exhal'st this vapor-vow in thee it is

If broken then it is no fault of mine

If by me broke what fool is not so wise

To lose an oath to win a paradise

By whom shall I send thisCompany Stay

And I had mine

Dumaine thy love is far from charity

That in love's grief desir'st society

You may look pale but I should blush I know

To be o'er-heard and taken napping so

It did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it

And since her time are colliers counted bright

Look here's thy love my foot and her face see

O some authority how to proceed

Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil

Now to plain dealing Lay these glozes by

Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France

I know the reason lady why you ask

You have a double tongue within your mask

And would afford my speechless vizard half

A calf fair lady

Let's part the word

Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks

Will you give horns chaste lady Do not so

One word in private with you ere I die

The face of an old Roman coin scarce

seen

His leg is too big for Hector's

Stuck with cloves

That columbine

I must rather give it the rein for it runs

against Hector

So did our looks

What says Maria

I'll stay with patience but the time is long
