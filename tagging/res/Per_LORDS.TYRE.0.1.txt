See, not a man in private conference

Or counsel has respect with him but he.

Follow me, then.—Lord Helicane, a word.

Know that our griefs are risen to the top,

And now at length they overflow their banks.

Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane.

But if the Prince do live, let us salute him,

Or know what ground’s made happy by his breath.

If in the world he live, we’ll seek him out;

If in his grave he rest, we’ll find him there,

And be resolved he lives to govern us,

Or dead, give ’s cause to mourn his funeral

And leave us to our free election.

Live, noble Helicane!

To wisdom he’s a fool that will not yield.

And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,

We with our travels will endeavor.
