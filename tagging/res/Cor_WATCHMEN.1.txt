From whence

You may not pass you must return Our general

Will no more hear from thence

Be it so go back The virtue of your name

Is not here passable

Faith sir if you had told as many lies in

his behalf as you have uttered words in your own

you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous

to lie as to live chastely Therefore go back

You are a Roman are you

Then you should hate Rome as he does

Can you when you have pushed out your gates the

very defender of them and in a violent popular

ignorance given your enemy your shield think to

front his revenges with the easy groans of old

women the virginal palms of your daughters or

with the palsied intercession of such a decayed

dotant as you seem to be Can you think to blow

out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in

with such weak breath as this No you are deceived

Therefore back to Rome and prepare for

your execution You are condemned Our general

has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon

Come my captain knows you not

My general cares not for you Back I say

go lest I let forth your half pint of blood Back

That's the utmost of your having Back

Now sir is your name Menenius

Do you hear how we are shent for keeping

your Greatness back

A noble fellow I warrant him
