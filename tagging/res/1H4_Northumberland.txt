Yea, my good lord.

Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,

Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,

Were, as he says, not with such strength denied

As is delivered to your Majesty.

Either envy, therefore, or misprision

Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.

What, drunk with choler? Stay and pause awhile.

Here comes your uncle.

Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.

He was; I heard the proclamation.

And then it was when the unhappy king—

Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forth

Upon his Irish expedition;

From whence he, intercepted, did return

To be deposed and shortly murderèd.

He did; myself did hear it.

Imagination of some great exploit

Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool

Art thou to break into this woman’s mood,

Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!

At Berkeley Castle.

Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip.

Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.
