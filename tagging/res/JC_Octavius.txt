


Your brother too must die Consent you Lepidus

Prick him down Antony

Or here or at the Capitol

So you thought him

And took his voice who should be pricked to die

In our black sentence and proscription

You may do your will

But he's a tried and valiant soldier

Let us do so for we are at the stake

And bayed about with many enemies

And some that smile have in their hearts I fear

Millions of mischiefs

Now Antony our hopes are answerd

You said the enemy would not come down

But keep the hills and upper regions

It proves not so their battles are at hand

They mean to warn us at Philippi here

Answering before we do demand of them

Upon the right hand I keep thou the left

I do not cross you but I will do so

Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle

Stir not until the signal

Not that we love words better as you do

Come come the cause If arguing make us sweat

The proof of it will turn to redder drops

Look I draw a sword against conspirators

When think you that the sword goes up again

Never till Caesar's three and thirty wounds

Be well avenged or till another Caesar

Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors

So I hope

I was not born to die on Brutus' sword

Come Antony away

Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth

If you dare fight today come to the field

If not when you have stomachs

What man is that

All that served Brutus I will entertain them

Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me

Do so good Messala

According to his virtue let us use him

With all respect and rites of burial

Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie

Most like a soldier ordered honorably

So call the field to rest and let's away

To part the glories of this happy day
