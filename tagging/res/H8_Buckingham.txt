


Good morrow and well met How have you done

Since last we saw in France

An untimely ague

Stayed me a prisoner in my chamber when

Those suns of glory those two lights of men

Met in the vale of Andren

All the whole time

I was my chamber's prisoner

O you go far

Who did guide

I mean who set the body and the limbs

Of this great sport together as you guess

I pray you who my lord

The devil speed him No man's pie is freed

From his ambitious finger What had he

To do in these fierce vanities I wonder

That such a keech can with his very bulk

Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun

And keep it from the Earth

Why the devil

Upon this French going-out took he upon him

Without the privity o' th' King t' appoint

Who should attend on him He makes up the file

Of all the gentry for the most part such

To whom as great a charge as little honor

He meant to lay upon and his own letter

The honorable board of council out

Must fetch him in he papers

O many

Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em

For this great journey What did this vanity

But minister communication of

A most poor issue

Every man

After the hideous storm that followed was

A thing inspired and not consulting broke

Into a general prophecy that this tempest

Dashing the garment of this peace aboded

The sudden breach on 't

Why all this business

Our reverend cardinal carried

This butcher's cur is venomed-mouthed and I

Have not the power to muzzle him therefore best

Not wake him in his slumber A beggar's book

Outworths a noble's blood

I read in 's looks

Matter against me and his eye reviled

Me as his abject object At this instant

He bores me with some trick He's gone to th' King

I'll follow and outstare him

I'll to the King

And from a mouth of honor quite cry down

This Ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim

There's difference in no persons

Sir

I am thankful to you and I'll go along

By your prescription But this top-proud fellow

Whom from the flow of gall I name not but

From sincere motionsby intelligence

And proofs as clear as founts in July when

We see each grain of gravel I do know

To be corrupt and treasonous

To th' King I'll say 't and make my vouch as strong

As shore of rock Attend This holy fox

Or wolf or bothfor he is equal rav'nous

As he is subtle and as prone to mischief

As able to perform 't his mind and place

Infecting one another yea reciprocally

Only to show his pomp as well in France

As here at home suggests the King our master

To this last costly treaty th' interview

That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass

Did break i' th' rinsing

Pray give me favor sir This cunning cardinal

The articles o' th' combination drew

As himself pleased and they were ratified

As he cried Thus let be to as much end

As give a crutch to th' dead But our Count Cardinal

Has done this and 'tis well for worthy Wolsey

Who cannot err he did it Now this follows

Which as I take it is a kind of puppy

To th' old dam treason Charles the Emperor

Under pretense to see the Queen his aunt

For 'twas indeed his color but he came

To whisper Wolseyhere makes visitation

His fears were that the interview betwixt

England and France might through their amity

Breed him some prejudice for from this league

Peeped harms that menaced him privily

Deals with our cardinal and as I trow

Which I do well for I am sure the Emperor

Paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted

Ere it was asked But when the way was made

And paved with gold the Emperor thus desired

That he would please to alter the King's course

And break the foresaid peace Let the King know

As soon he shall by methat thus the Cardinal

Does buy and sell his honor as he pleases

And for his own advantage

No not a syllable

I do pronounce him in that very shape

He shall appear in proof

Lo you my lord

The net has fall'n upon me I shall perish

Under device and practice

It will help me nothing

To plead mine innocence for that dye is on me

Which makes my whit'st part black The will of heaven

Be done in this and all things I obey

O my Lord Abergavenny fare you well

So so

These are the limbs o' th' plot No more I hope

O Michael Hopkins

My surveyor is false The o'ergreat cardinal

Hath showed him gold My life is spanned already

I am the shadow of poor Buckingham

Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on

By dark'ning my clear sun My lord farewell

All good people

You that thus far have come to pity me

Hear what I say and then go home and lose me

I have this day received a traitor's judgment

And by that name must die Yet heaven bear witness

And if I have a conscience let it sink me

Even as the ax falls if I be not faithful

The law I bear no malice for my death

'T has done upon the premises but justice

But those that sought it I could wish more Christian

Be what they will I heartily forgive 'em

Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief

Nor build their evils on the graves of great men

For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em

For further life in this world I ne'er hope

Nor will I sue although the King have mercies

More than I dare make faults You few that loved me

And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham

His noble friends and fellows whom to leave

Is only bitter to him only dying

Go with me like good angels to my end

And as the long divorce of steel falls on me

Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice

And lift my soul to heavenLead on a' God's name

Sir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you

As I would be forgiven I forgive all

There cannot be those numberless offenses

'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with No black envy

Shall make my grave Commend me to his Grace

And if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him

You met him half in heaven My vows and prayers

Yet are the King's and till my soul forsake

Shall cry for blessings on him May he live

Longer than I have time to tell his years

Ever beloved and loving may his rule be

And when old Time shall lead him to his end

Goodness and he fill up one monument

Nay Sir Nicholas

Let it alone My state now will but mock me

When I came hither I was Lord High Constable

And Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun

Yet I am richer than my base accusers

That never knew what truth meant I now seal it

And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for 't

My noble father Henry of Buckingham

Who first raised head against usurping Richard

Flying for succor to his servant Banister

Being distressed was by that wretch betrayed

And without trial fell God's peace be with him

Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying

My father's loss like a most royal prince

Restored me to my honors and out of ruins

Made my name once more noble Now his son

Henry the Eighth life honor name and all

That made me happy at one stroke has taken

Forever from the world I had my trial

And must needs say a noble one which makes me

A little happier than my wretched father

Yet thus far we are one in fortunes both

Fell by our servants by those men we loved most

A most unnatural and faithless service

Heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me

This from a dying man receive as certain

Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels

Be sure you be not loose for those you make friends

And give your hearts to when they once perceive

The least rub in your fortunes fall away

Like water from you never found again

But where they mean to sink you All good people

Pray for me I must now forsake you The last hour

Of my long weary life is come upon me

Farewell And when you would say something that is sad

Speak how I fell I have done and God forgive me
