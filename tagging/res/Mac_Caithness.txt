Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

Some say he’s mad; others that lesser hate him

Do call it valiant fury. But for certain

He cannot buckle his distempered cause

Within the belt of rule.

Well, march we on

To give obedience where ’tis truly owed.

Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal,

And with him pour we in our country’s purge

Each drop of us.
