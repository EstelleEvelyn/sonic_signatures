


I am almost afraid to stand alone

Here in the churchyard Yet I will adventure

O Lord they fight I will go call the watch

This is the place there where the torch doth burn

He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave

And bid me stand aloof and so I did

Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb

And by and by my master drew on him

And then I ran away to call the watch
