


Why should we in the compass of a pale

Keep law and form and due proportion

Showing as in a model our firm estate

When our sea-walld garden the whole land

Is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up

Her fruit trees all unpruned her hedges ruined

Her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs

Swarming with caterpillars

What are they dead

What think you the King shall be deposed
