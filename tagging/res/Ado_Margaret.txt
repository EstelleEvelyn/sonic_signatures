


So would not I for your own sake, for I have

many ill qualities.

I say my prayers aloud.

God match me with a good dancer.

And God keep him out of my sight when the

dance is done. Answer, clerk.

I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.

Troth, I think your other rebato were

better.

By my troth, ’s not so good, and I warrant

your cousin will say so.

I like the new tire within excellently, if the

hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a

most rare fashion, i’ faith. I saw the Duchess of

Milan’s gown that they praise so.

By my troth, ’s but a nightgown in respect

of yours—cloth o’ gold, and cuts, and laced with

silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,

and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel.

But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion,

yours is worth ten on ’t.

’Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a

man.

Of what, lady? Of speaking honorably? Is

not marriage honorable in a beggar? Is not your

lord honorable without marriage? I think you

would have me say “Saving your reverence, a husband.”

An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking,

I’ll offend nobody. Is there any harm in “the heavier

for a husband”? None, I think, an it be the right

husband and the right wife. Otherwise, ’tis light and

not heavy. Ask my lady Beatrice else. Here she

comes.

Clap ’s into Light o’ love. That goes

without a burden. Do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.

O, illegitimate construction! I scorn that

with my heels.

For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?

Well, an you be not turned Turk, there’s no

more sailing by the star.

Nothing, I; but God send everyone their

heart’s desire.

A maid, and stuffed! There’s goodly catching

of cold.

Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit

become me rarely?

Get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus

and lay it to your heart. It is the only thing for

a qualm.

Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral

meaning; I meant plain holy thistle. You may think

perchance that I think you are in love. Nay, by ’r

Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I

list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot

think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that

you are in love or that you will be in love or that you

can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and

now is he become a man. He swore he would never

marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats

his meat without grudging. And how you may be

converted I know not, but methinks you look with

your eyes as other women do.

Not a false gallop.

Will you then write me a sonnet in praise

of my beauty?

To have no man come over me? Why, shall I

always keep below stairs?

And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils,

which hit but hurt not.

Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our

own.

Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I

think hath legs.
