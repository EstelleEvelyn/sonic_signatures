


Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old

I bade her comeWhat lamb What ladybird

God forbid Where's this girl What Juliet

Your mother

Faith I can tell her age unto an hour

I'll lay fourteen of my teeth and yet to my teen

be it spoken I have but four she's not fourteen

How long is it now to Lammastide

Even or odd of all days in the year

Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen

Susan and she God rest all Christian souls

Were of an age Well Susan is with God

She was too good for me But as I said

On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen

That shall she Marry I remember it well

'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years

And she was weaned I never shall forget it

Of all the days of the year upon that day

For I had then laid wormwood to my dug

Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall

My lord and you were then at Mantua

Nay I do bear a brain But as I said

When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple

Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool

To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug

Shake quoth the dovehouse 'Twas no need I trow

To bid me trudge

And since that time it is eleven years

For then she could stand high-lone Nay by th' rood

She could have run and waddled all about

For even the day before she broke her brow

And then my husband God be with his soul

He was a merry man took up the child

Yea quoth he Dost thou fall upon thy face

Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit

Wilt thou not Jule And by my holidam

The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay

To see now how a jest shall come about

I warrant an I should live a thousand years

I never should forget it Wilt thou not Jule quoth he

And pretty fool it stinted and said Ay

Yes madam yet I cannot choose but laugh

To think it should leave crying and say Ay

And yet I warrant it had upon its brow

A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone

A perilous knock and it cried bitterly

Yea quoth my husband Fall'st upon thy face

Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age

Wilt thou not Jule It stinted and said Ay

Peace I have done God mark thee to his grace

Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed

An I might live to see thee married once

I have my wish

An honor Were not I thine only nurse

I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy teat

A man young ladylady such a man

As all the worldwhy he's a man of wax

Nay he's a flower in faith a very flower

No less Nay bigger Women grow by men

Go girl seek happy nights to happy days

Madam your mother craves a word with you

Marry bachelor

Her mother is the lady of the house

And a good lady and a wise and virtuous

I nursed her daughter that you talked withal

I tell you he that can lay hold of her

Shall have the chinks

The son and heir of old Tiberio

Marry that I think be young Petruchio

I know not

His name is Romeo and a Montague

The only son of your great enemy

What's this What's this

Anon anon

Come let's away The strangers all are gone

should lead her in a fool's paradise as they say it

were a very gross kind of behavior as they say For

the gentlewoman is young and therefore if you

should deal double with her truly it were an ill

thing to be offered to any gentlewoman and very

weak dealing

Good heart and i' faith I will tell her as much

Lord Lord she will be a joyful woman

I will tell her sir that you do protest which as

I take it is a gentlemanlike offer

Hie you to church I must another way

To fetch a ladder by the which your love

Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark

Though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo

Whoever would have thought it Romeo

I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes

God save the mark here on his manly breast

A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse

Pale pale as ashes all bedaubed in blood

All in gore blood I swoond at the sight

O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had

O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman

That ever I should live to see thee dead

Tybalt is gone and Romeo banishd

Romeo that killed himhe is banishd

It did it did alas the day it did

There's no trust

No faith no honesty in men All perjured

All forsworn all naught all dissemblers

Ah where's my man Give me some aqua vitae

These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old

Shame come to Romeo

Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse

Piteous predicament Even so lies she

Blubb'ring and weeping weeping and blubb'ring

For Juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand

Why should you fall into so deep an O

Ah sir ah sir death's the end of all

O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps

And now falls on her bed and then starts up

And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries

And then down falls again

O Lord I could have stayed here all the night

To hear good counsel O what learning is

My lord I'll tell my lady you will come

I speak no treason

May not one speak

Faith here it is

Romeo is banished and all the world to nothing

That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you

Or if he do it needs must be by stealth

Then since the case so stands as now it doth

And from my soul too else beshrew them both
