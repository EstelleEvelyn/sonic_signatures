


Here my lord

What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth

You shall not stir out of your house today

Caesar I never stood on ceremonies

Yet now they fright me There is one within

Besides the things that we have heard and seen

Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch

A lioness hath whelpd in the streets

And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead

Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds

In ranks and squadrons and right form of war

Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol

The noise of battle hurtled in the air

Horses did neigh and dying men did groan

And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets

O Caesar these things are beyond all use

And I do fear them

When beggars die there are no comets seen

The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes

Alas my lord

Your wisdom is consumed in confidence

Do not go forth today Call it my fear

That keeps you in the house and not your own

We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House

And he shall say you are not well today

Let me upon my knee prevail in this

Say he is sick
