


The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night

Check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light

And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels

From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels

Now ere the sun advance his burning eye

The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry

I must upfill this osier cage of ours

With baleful weeds and precious-juicd flowers

The Earth that's nature's mother is her tomb

What is her burying grave that is her womb

And from her womb children of divers kind

We sucking on her natural bosom find

Many for many virtues excellent

None but for some and yet all different

O mickle is the powerful grace that lies

In plants herbs stones and their true qualities

For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live

But to the Earth some special good doth give

Nor aught so good but strained from that fair use

Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse

Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied

And vice sometime by action dignified

Within the infant rind of this weak flower

Poison hath residence and medicine power

For this being smelt with that part cheers each part

Being tasted stays all senses with the heart

Two such opposd kings encamp them still

In man as well as herbsgrace and rude will

And where the worser is predominant

Full soon the canker death eats up that plant

Benedicite

What early tongue so sweet saluteth me

Young son it argues a distempered head

So soon to bid Good morrow to thy bed

Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye

And where care lodges sleep will never lie

But where unbruisd youth with unstuffed brain

Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign

Therefore thy earliness doth me assure

Thou art uproused with some distemp'rature

Or if not so then here I hit it right

Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight

God pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline

That's my good son But where hast thou been then

Be plain good son and homely in thy drift

Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

Holy Saint Francis what a change is here

Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear

So soon forsaken Young men's love then lies

Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes

Jesu Maria what a deal of brine

Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline

How much salt water thrown away in waste

To season love that of it doth not taste

The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears

Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears

Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit

Of an old tear that is not washed off yet

If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine

Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline

And art thou changed Pronounce this sentence then

Women may fall when there's no strength in men

For doting not for loving pupil mine

Not in a grave

To lay one in another out to have

O she knew well

Thy love did read by rote that could not spell

But come young waverer come go with me

In one respect I'll thy assistant be

For this alliance may so happy prove

To turn your households' rancor to pure love

Wisely and slow They stumble that run fast

So smile the heavens upon this holy act

That after-hours with sorrow chide us not

These violent delights have violent ends

And in their triumph die like fire and powder

Which as they kiss consume The sweetest honey

Is loathsome in his own deliciousness

And in the taste confounds the appetite

Therefore love moderately Long love doth so

Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

Here comes the lady O so light a foot

Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint

A lover may bestride the gossamers

That idles in the wanton summer air

And yet not fall so light is vanity

Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both

Come come with me and we will make short work

For by your leaves you shall not stay alone

Till Holy Church incorporate two in one

Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man

Affliction is enamored of thy parts

And thou art wedded to calamity

Too familiar

Is my dear son with such sour company

I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom

A gentler judgment vanished from his lips

Not body's death but body's banishment

Here from Verona art thou banishd

Be patient for the world is broad and wide

O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness

Thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince

Taking thy part hath rushed aside the law

And turned that black word death to banishment

This is dear mercy and thou seest it not

Thou fond mad man hear me a little speak

I'll give thee armor to keep off that word

Adversity's sweet milk philosophy

To comfort thee though thou art banishd

O then I see that madmen have no ears

Let me dispute with thee of thy estate

Arise One knocks Good Romeo hide thyself

Hark how they knockWho's thereRomeo arise

Thou wilt be takenStay awhileStand up

Run to my studyBy and byGod's will

What simpleness is thisI come I come

Who knocks so hard Whence come you What's your will

 Welcome then

There on the ground with his own tears made drunk

Hold thy desperate hand

Art thou a man Thy form cries out thou art

Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote

The unreasonable fury of a beast

Unseemly woman in a seeming man

And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both

Thou hast amazed me By my holy order

I thought thy disposition better tempered

Hast thou slain Tybalt Wilt thou slay thyself

And slay thy lady that in thy life lives

By doing damnd hate upon thyself

Why railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth

Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet

In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose

Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit

Which like a usurer abound'st in all

And usest none in that true use indeed

Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit

Thy noble shape is but a form of wax

Digressing from the valor of a man

Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury

Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish

Thy wit that ornament to shape and love

Misshapen in the conduct of them both

Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask

Is set afire by thine own ignorance

And thou dismembered with thine own defense

What rouse thee man Thy Juliet is alive

For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead

There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee

But thou slewest Tybalt there art thou happy

The law that threatened death becomes thy friend

And turns it to exile there art thou happy

A pack of blessings light upon thy back

Happiness courts thee in her best array

But like a misbehaved and sullen wench

Thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love

Take heed take heed for such die miserable

Go get thee to thy love as was decreed

Ascend her chamber Hence and comfort her

But look thou stay not till the watch be set

For then thou canst not pass to Mantua

Where thou shalt live till we can find a time

To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends

Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back

With twenty hundred thousand times more joy

Than thou went'st forth in lamentation

Go before nurse Commend me to thy lady

And bid her hasten all the house to bed

Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto

Romeo is coming

Go hence good nightand here stands all your state

Either be gone before the watch be set

Or by the break of day disguised from hence

Sojourn in Mantua I'll find out your man

And he shall signify from time to time

Every good hap to you that chances here

Give me thy hand 'Tis late Farewell Good night

On Thursday sir The time is very short

You say you do not know the lady's mind

Uneven is the course I like it not

I would I knew not why it should be slowed

Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell

That's a certain text

My leisure serves me pensive daughter now

My lord we must entreat the time alone

O Juliet I already know thy grief

It strains me past the compass of my wits

I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it

On Thursday next be married to this County

Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope

Which craves as desperate an execution

As that is desperate which we would prevent

If rather than to marry County Paris

Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself

Then is it likely thou wilt undertake

A thing like death to chide away this shame

That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it

And if thou darest I'll give thee remedy

Hold then Go home be merry give consent

To marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow

Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone

Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber

Take thou this vial being then in bed

And this distilling liquor drink thou off

When presently through all thy veins shall run

A cold and drowsy humor for no pulse

Shall keep his native progress but surcease

No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest

The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade

To paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall

Like death when he shuts up the day of life

Each part deprived of supple government

Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death

And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death

Thou shalt continue two and forty hours

And then awake as from a pleasant sleep

Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes

To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead

Then as the manner of our country is

In thy best robes uncovered on the bier

Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault

Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie

In the meantime against thou shalt awake

Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift

And hither shall he come and he and I

Will watch thy waking and that very night

Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua

And this shall free thee from this present shame

If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear

Abate thy valor in the acting it

Hold get you gone Be strong and prosperous

In this resolve I'll send a friar with speed

To Mantua with my letters to thy lord

Come is the bride ready to go to church

Peace ho for shame Confusion's cure lives not

In these confusions Heaven and yourself

Had part in this fair maid Now heaven hath all

And all the better is it for the maid

Your part in her you could not keep from death

But heaven keeps his part in eternal life

The most you sought was her promotion

For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced

And weep you now seeing she is advanced

Above the clouds as high as heaven itself

O in this love you love your child so ill

That you run mad seeing that she is well

She's not well married that lives married long

But she's best married that dies married young

Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary

On this fair corse and as the custom is

And in her best array bear her to church

For though fond nature bids us all lament

Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment

Sir go you in and madam go with him

And go Sir Paris Everyone prepare

To follow this fair corse unto her grave

The heavens do lour upon you for some ill

Move them no more by crossing their high will

This same should be the voice of Friar John

Welcome from Mantua What says Romeo

Or if his mind be writ give me his letter

Who bare my letter then to Romeo

Unhappy fortune By my brotherhood

The letter was not nice but full of charge

Of dear import and the neglecting it

May do much danger Friar John go hence

Get me an iron crow and bring it straight

Unto my cell

Now must I to the monument alone

Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake

She will beshrew me much that Romeo

Hath had no notice of these accidents

But I will write again to Mantua

And keep her at my cell till Romeo come

Poor living corse closed in a dead man's tomb

Saint Francis be my speed How oft tonight

Have my old feet stumbled at gravesWho's there

Bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend

What torch is yond that vainly lends his light

To grubs and eyeless skulls As I discern

It burneth in the Capels' monument

Who is it

How long hath he been there

Go with me to the vault

Stay then I'll go alone Fear comes upon me

O much I fear some ill unthrifty thing

 Romeo

Alack alack what blood is this which stains

The stony entrance of this sepulcher

What mean these masterless and gory swords

To lie discolored by this place of peace

Romeo O pale Who else What Paris too

And steeped in blood Ah what an unkind hour

Is guilty of this lamentable chance

The lady stirs

I hear some noiseLady come from that nest

Of death contagion and unnatural sleep

A greater power than we can contradict

Hath thwarted our intents Come come away

Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead

And Paris too Come I'll dispose of thee

Among a sisterhood of holy nuns

Stay not to question for the watch is coming

Come go good Juliet I dare no longer stay

I am the greatest able to do least

Yet most suspected as the time and place

Doth make against me of this direful murder

And here I stand both to impeach and purge

Myself condemnd and myself excused

I will be brief for my short date of breath

Is not so long as is a tedious tale

Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet

And she there dead that Romeo's faithful wife

I married them and their stol'n marriage day

Was Tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death

Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city

For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pined

You to remove that siege of grief from her

Betrothed and would have married her perforce

To County Paris Then comes she to me

And with wild looks bid me devise some mean

To rid her from this second marriage

Or in my cell there would she kill herself

Then gave I her so tutored by my art

A sleeping potion which so took effect

As I intended for it wrought on her

The form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo

That he should hither come as this dire night

To help to take her from her borrowed grave

Being the time the potion's force should cease

But he which bore my letter Friar John

Was stayed by accident and yesternight

Returned my letter back Then all alone

At the prefixd hour of her waking

Came I to take her from her kindred's vault

Meaning to keep her closely at my cell

Till I conveniently could send to Romeo

But when I came some minute ere the time

Of her awakening here untimely lay

The noble Paris and true Romeo dead

She wakes and I entreated her come forth

And bear this work of heaven with patience

But then a noise did scare me from the tomb

And she too desperate would not go with me

But as it seems did violence on herself

All this I know and to the marriage

Her nurse is privy And if aught in this

Miscarried by my fault let my old life

Be sacrificed some hour before his time

Unto the rigor of severest law
