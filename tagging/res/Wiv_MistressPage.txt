the holiday time of my beauty and am I now a

subject for them Let me see

Ask me no reason why I love you for though Love

use Reason for his precisian he admits him not for

his counselor You are not young no more am I Go

to then there's sympathy You are merry so am I

Ha ha then there's more sympathy You love sack

and so do I Would you desire better sympathy Let

it suffice thee Mistress Pageat the least if the love

of soldier can sufficethat I love thee I will not say

pity me'tis not a soldier-like phrasebut I say love

me By me

Thine own true knight

By day or night

Or any kind of light

With all his might

For thee to fight

John Falstaff

What a Herod of Jewry is this O wicked wicked

world One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with

age to show himself a young gallant What an

unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard

pickedwith the devil's nameout of my conversation

that he dares in this manner assay me

Why he hath not been thrice in my company

What should I say to him I was then frugal of my

mirth Heaven forgive me Why I'll exhibit a bill

in the Parliament for the putting down of men

How shall I be revenged on him For revenged I

will be as sure as his guts are made of puddings

And trust me I was coming to you

You look very ill

Faith but you do in my mind

What's the matter woman

Hang the trifle woman take the honor

What is it Dispense with trifles What is it

What thou liest Sir Alice Ford These

knights will hack and so thou shouldst not alter

the article of thy gentry

Letter for letter but that the name of

Page and Ford differs To thy great comfort in this

mystery of ill opinions here's the twin brother of

thy letter

But let thine inherit first for I protest

mine never shall I warrant he hath a thousand of

these letters writ with blank space for different

namessure moreand these are of the second

edition He will print them out of doubt for he

cares not what he puts into the press when he

would put us two I had rather be a giantess and lie

under Mount Pelion Well I will find you twenty

lascivious turtles ere one chaste man

Nay I know not It makes me almost

ready to wrangle with mine own honesty I'll entertain

myself like one that I am not acquainted

withal for sure unless he know some strain in

me that I know not myself he would never have

boarded me in this fury

So will I If he come under my hatches

I'll never to sea again Let's be revenged on him

Let's appoint him a meeting give him a show of

comfort in his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited

delay till he hath pawned his horses to mine

Host of the Garter

Why look where he comes and my

good man too He's as far from jealousy as I am

from giving him cause and that I hope is an

unmeasurable distance

Let's consult together against this greasy

knight Come hither

Whither go you George Hark you

Have with youYou'll come to dinner

George Look who

comes yonder

O Mistress Ford what have you done

You're shamed you're overthrown you're undone

forever

O well-a-day Mistress Ford having an

honest man to your husband to give him such

cause of suspicion

What cause of suspicion Out upon you

How am I mistook in you

Your husband's coming hither woman

with all the officers in Windsor to search for a gentleman

that he says is here now in the house by

your consent to take an ill advantage of his absence

You are undone

Pray heaven it be not so that you have

such a man here But 'tis most certain your husband's

coming with half Windsor at his heels to

search for such a one I come before to tell you If

you know yourself clear why I am glad of it But if

you have a friend here convey convey him out Be

not amazed Call all your senses to you defend

your reputation or bid farewell to your good life

forever

For shame Never stand you had

rather and you had rather Your husband's here

at hand Bethink you of some conveyance In the

house you cannot hide him O how have you deceived

me Look here is a basket If he be of any

reasonable stature he may creep in here and

throw foul linen upon him as if it were going to

bucking Orit is whiting timesend him by your

two men to Datchet Mead

What Sir John Falstaff

Are these your letters knight

Help to cover your master

boyCall your men Mistress FordYou dissembling

knight

Is there not a double excellency in this

What a taking was he in when your

husband asked who was in the basket

Hang him dishonest rascal I would all

of the same strain were in the same distress

I will lay a plot to try that and we will

yet have more tricks with Falstaff His dissolute

disease will scarce obey this medicine

We will do it Let him be sent for tomorrow

eight o'clock to have amends

Heard you

that

You do yourself mighty wrong Master

Ford

Good Master Fenton come not to my child

I mean it not I seek you a better husband

Come trouble not yourselfGood Master Fenton

I will not be your friend nor enemy

My daughter will I question how she loves you

And as I find her so am I affected

Till then farewell sir She must needs go in

Her father will be angry

Is he at Master Ford's already think'st

thou

I'll be with her by and by I'll but bring

my young man here to school

Look where his master comes 'Tis a playing day I

seeHow now Sir Hugh no school today

Sir Hugh my husband says my son

profits nothing in the world at his book I pray you

ask him some questions in his accidence

Come on sirrah Hold up your head

Answer your master Be not afraid

Peace

Prithee hold thy

peace

He is a better scholar than I thought he

was

Adieu good Sir HughGet you home

boy Come We stay too

long

What ho gossip Ford What

ho

How now sweetheart who's at home

besides yourself

Indeed

Truly I am so glad you have nobody

here

Why woman your husband is in his

old lunes again He so takes on yonder with my

husband so rails against all married mankind so

curses all Eve's daughters of what complexion soever

and so buffets himself on the forehead crying

Peer out peer out that any madness I ever yet

beheld seemed but tameness civility and patience

to this his distemper he is in now I am glad the fat

knight is not here

Of none but him and swears he was

carried out the last time he searched for him in a

basket protests to my husband he is now here

and hath drawn him and the rest of their company

from their sport to make another experiment of

his suspicion But I am glad the knight is not here

Now he shall see his own foolery

Hard by at street end He will be here

anon

Why then you are utterly shamed and

he's but a dead man What a woman are you Away

with him away with him Better shame than

murder

Alas three of Master Ford's brothers

watch the door with pistols that none shall issue

out Otherwise you might slip away ere he came

But what make you here

Creep into the kiln-hole

If you go out in your own semblance

you die Sir Johnunless you go out disguised

Alas the day I know not There is no

woman's gown big enough for him otherwise he

might put on a hat a muffler and a kerchief and

so escape

On my word it will serve him She's as

big as he is And there's her thrummed hat and her

muffler tooRun up Sir John

Quick quick We'll come dress you

straight Put on the gown the while

Heaven guide him to thy husband's

cudgel and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards

Ay in good sadness is he and talks of

the basket too howsoever he hath had

intelligence

Nay but he'll be here presently Let's go

dress him like the witch of Brentford

Hang him dishonest varlet We cannot

misuse him enough

We'll leave a proof by that which we will do

Wives may be merry and yet honest too

We do not act that often jest and laugh

'Tis old but true Still swine eats all the draff

Come Mother Pratt come give me

your hand

Are you not ashamed I think you have

killed the poor woman

Trust me he beat him most pitifully

I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung

o'er the altar It hath done meritorious service

The spirit of wantonness is sure

scared out of him If the devil have him not in fee

simple with fine and recovery he will never I

think in the way of waste attempt us again

Yes by all meansif it be but to scrape

the figures out of your husband's brains If they

can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat

knight shall be any further afflicted we two will

still be the ministers

Come to the forge with it then shape

it I would not have things cool

Within a quarter of an hour

There is an old tale goes that Herne the Hunter

Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest

Doth all the wintertime at still midnight

Walk round about an oak with great ragged horns

And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle

And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain

In a most hideous and dreadful manner

You have heard of such a spirit and well you know

The superstitious idle-headed eld

Received and did deliver to our age

This tale of Herne the Hunter for a truth

That likewise have we thought upon and thus

Nan Page my daughter and my little son

And three or four more of their growth we'll dress

Like urchins aufs and fairies green and white

With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads

And rattles in their hands Upon a sudden

As Falstaff she and I are newly met

Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once

With some diffusd song Upon their sight

We two in great amazedness will fly

Then let them all encircle him about

And fairy-like to pinch the unclean knight

And ask him why that hour of fairy revel

In their so sacred paths he dares to tread

In shape profane

The truth being known

We'll all present ourselves dis-horn the spirit

And mock him home to Windsor

My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies

Finely attird in a robe of white

Fear not you that Go get us properties

And tricking for our fairies

Go Mistress Ford

Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind

I'll to the doctor He hath my good will

And none but he to marry with Nan Page

That Slender though well-landed is an idiot

And he my husband best of all affects

The doctor is well-moneyed and his friends

Potent at court He none but he shall have her

Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her

Master Doctor my daughter is in

green When you see your time take her by the

hand away with her to the deanery and dispatch

it quickly Go before into the park We two must go

together

Fare you well sir

My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse

of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying

my daughter But 'tis no matter Better a little chiding

than a great deal of heartbreak

They are all couched in a pit hard by

Herne's oak with obscured lights which at the

very instant of Falstaff's and our meeting they will

at once display to the night

If he be not amazed he will be

mocked If he be amazed he will every way be

mocked

Against such lewdsters and their lechery

Those that betray them do no treachery

Alas what noise

Away away

I pray you come hold up the jest no higher

Now good Sir John how like you Windsor wives

See you these husband Do not these fair yokes

Become the forest better than the town

Why Sir John do you think though we

would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the

head and shoulders and have given ourselves

without scruple to hell that ever the devil could

have made you our delight

A puffed man

Doctors doubt that If Anne

Page be my daughter she is by this Doctor Caius'

wife

Good George be not angry I knew of

your purpose turned my daughter into green

and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery

and there married

Why Did you take her in green

Why went you not with Master Doctor maid

Well I will muse no furtherMaster Fenton

Heaven give you many many merry days

Good husband let us every one go home

And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire

Sir John and all
