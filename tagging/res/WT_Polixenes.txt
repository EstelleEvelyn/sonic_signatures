


Nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been

The shepherd's note since we have left our throne

Without a burden Time as long again

Would be filled up my brother with our thanks

And yet we should for perpetuity

Go hence in debt And therefore like a cipher

Yet standing in rich place I multiply

With one We thank you many thousands more

That go before it

Sir that's tomorrow

I am questioned by my fears of what may chance

Or breed upon our absence that may blow

No sneaping winds at home to make us say

This is put forth too truly Besides I have stayed

To tire your Royalty

No longer stay

Very sooth tomorrow

Press me not beseech you so

There is no tongue that moves none none i' th' world

So soon as yours could win me So it should now

Were there necessity in your request although

'Twere needful I denied it My affairs

Do even drag me homeward which to hinder

Were in your love a whip to me my stay

To you a charge and trouble To save both

Farewell our brother

No madam

I may not verily

Your guest then madam

To be your prisoner should import offending

Which is for me less easy to commit

Than you to punish

We were fair queen

Two lads that thought there was no more behind

But such a day tomorrow as today

And to be boy eternal

We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i' th' sun

And bleat the one at th' other What we changed

Was innocence for innocence We knew not

The doctrine of ill-doing nor dreamed

That any did Had we pursued that life

And our weak spirits ne'er been higher reared

With stronger blood we should have answered heaven

Boldly Not guilty the imposition cleared

Hereditary ours

O my most sacred lady

Temptations have since then been born to 's for

In those unfledged days was my wife a girl

Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes

Of my young playfellow

What means Sicilia

How my lord

If at home sir

He's all my exercise my mirth my matter

Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy

My parasite my soldier statesman all

He makes a July's day short as December

And with his varying childness cures in me

Thoughts that would thick my blood

This is strange Methinks

My favor here begins to warp Not speak

Good day Camillo

What is the news i' th' court

The King hath on him such a countenance

As he had lost some province and a region

Loved as he loves himself Even now I met him

With customary compliment when he

Wafting his eyes to th' contrary and falling

A lip of much contempt speeds from me and

So leaves me to consider what is breeding

That changes thus his manners

How dare not Do not Do you know and dare not

Be intelligent to me'tis thereabouts

For to yourself what you do know you must

And cannot say you dare not Good Camillo

Your changed complexions are to me a mirror

Which shows me mine changed too for I must be

A party in this alteration finding

Myself thus altered with 't

How caught of me

Make me not sighted like the basilisk

I have looked on thousands who have sped the better

By my regard but killed none so Camillo

As you are certainly a gentleman thereto

Clerklike experienced which no less adorns

Our gentry than our parents' noble names

In whose success we are gentle I beseech you

If you know aught which does behoove my knowledge

Thereof to be informed imprison 't not

In ignorant concealment

A sickness caught of me and yet I well

I must be answered Dost thou hear Camillo

I conjure thee by all the parts of man

Which honor does acknowledge whereof the least

Is not this suit of mine that thou declare

What incidency thou dost guess of harm

Is creeping toward me how far off how near

Which way to be prevented if to be

If not how best to bear it

On good Camillo

By whom Camillo

For what

O then my best blood turn

To an infected jelly and my name

Be yoked with his that did betray the Best

Turn then my freshest reputation to

A savor that may strike the dullest nostril

Where I arrive and my approach be shunned

Nay hated too worse than the great'st infection

That e'er was heard or read

How should this grow

I do believe thee

I saw his heart in 's face Give me thy hand

Be pilot to me and thy places shall

Still neighbor mine My ships are ready and

My people did expect my hence departure

Two days ago This jealousy

Is for a precious creature As she's rare

Must it be great and as his person's mighty

Must it be violent and as he does conceive

He is dishonored by a man which ever

Professed to him why his revenges must

In that be made more bitter Fear o'ershades me

Good expedition be my friend and comfort

The gracious queen part of his theme but nothing

Of his ill-ta'en suspicion Come Camillo

I will respect thee as a father if

Thou bear'st my life off hence Let us avoid

I pray thee good Camillo be no more

importunate 'Tis a sickness denying thee anything

a death to grant this

As thou lov'st me Camillo wipe not out the

rest of thy services by leaving me now The need I

have of thee thine own goodness hath made Better

not to have had thee than thus to want thee Thou

having made me businesses which none without

thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to

execute them thyself or take away with thee the very

services thou hast done which if I have not enough

considered as too much I cannot to be more

thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit

therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country

Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very

naming punishes me with the remembrance of that

penitent as thou call'st him and reconciled king

my brother whose loss of his most precious queen

and children are even now to be afresh lamented

Say to me when sawst thou the Prince Florizell my

son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not

being gracious than they are in losing them when

they have approved their virtues

I have considered so much Camillo and

with some care so far that I have eyes under my

service which look upon his removedness from

whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom

from the house of a most homely shepherd a man

they say that from very nothing and beyond the

imagination of his neighbors is grown into an

unspeakable estate

That's likewise part of my intelligence but

I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou

shalt accompany us to the place where we will not

appearing what we are have some question with

the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not

uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither

Prithee be my present partner in this business and

lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia

My best Camillo We must disguise

ourselves

Shepherdess

A fair one are youwell you fit our ages

With flowers of winter

Wherefore gentle maiden

Do you neglect them

Say there be

Yet nature is made better by no mean

But nature makes that mean So over that art

Which you say adds to nature is an art

That nature makes You see sweet maid we marry

A gentler scion to the wildest stock

And make conceive a bark of baser kind

By bud of nobler race This is an art

Which does mend nature change it rather but

The art itself is nature

Then make your garden rich in gillyvors

And do not call them bastards

This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever

Ran on the greensward Nothing she does or seems

But smacks of something greater than herself

Too noble for this place

Pray good shepherd what fair swain is this

Which dances with your daughter

She dances featly

This is a brave fellow

You weary those that refresh us Pray let's

see these four threes of herdsmen

O father you'll know more of that hereafter

Is it not too far gone 'Tis time to part them

He's simple and tells much How now fair shepherd

Your heart is full of something that does take

Your mind from feasting Sooth when I was young

And handed love as you do I was wont

To load my she with knacks I would have ransacked

The peddler's silken treasury and have poured it

To her acceptance You have let him go

And nothing marted with him If your lass

Interpretation should abuse and call this

Your lack of love or bounty you were straited

For a reply at least if you make a care

Of happy holding her

What follows this

How prettily th' young swain seems to wash

The hand was fair beforeI have put you out

But to your protestation Let me hear

What you profess

And this my neighbor too

Fairly offered

Soft swain awhile beseech you

Have you a father

Knows he of this

Methinks a father

Is at the nuptial of his son a guest

That best becomes the table Pray you once more

Is not your father grown incapable

Of reasonable affairs Is he not stupid

With age and alt'ring rheums Can he speak Hear

Know man from man Dispute his own estate

Lies he not bedrid and again does nothing

But what he did being childish

By my white beard

You offer him if this be so a wrong

Something unfilial Reason my son

Should choose himself a wife but as good reason

The father all whose joy is nothing else

But fair posterity should hold some counsel

In such a business

Let him know 't

Prithee let him

Mark your divorce young sir

Whom son I dare not call Thou art too base

To be acknowledged Thou a scepter's heir

That thus affects a sheep-hookThou old traitor

I am sorry that by hanging thee I can

But shorten thy life one weekAnd thou fresh piece

Of excellent witchcraft whom of force must know

The royal fool thou cop'st with

I'll have thy beauty scratched with briers and made

More homely than thy stateFor thee fond boy

If I may ever know thou dost but sigh

That thou no more shalt see this knackas never

I mean thou shaltwe'll bar thee from succession

Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin

Far'r than Deucalion off Mark thou my words

Follow us to the court Thou churl for this time

Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee

From the dead blow of itAnd you enchantment

Worthy enough a herdsmanyea him too

That makes himself but for our honor therein

Unworthy theeif ever henceforth thou

These rural latches to his entrance open

Or hoop his body more with thy embraces

I will devise a death as cruel for thee

As thou art tender to 't

O not by much

Dear my brother

Let him that was the cause of this have power

To take off so much grief from you as he

Will piece up in himself

Masterly done

The very life seems warm upon her lip

She embraces him

Ay and make it manifest where she has lived

Or how stol'n from the dead
