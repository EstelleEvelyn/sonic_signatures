


God bless your Grace with health and happy days

Had he done so

Now fair befall you He deserved his death

And your good Graces both have well proceeded

To warn false traitors from the like attempts

But my good lord your Graces' words shall serve

As well as I had seen and heard him speak

And do not doubt right noble princes both

But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens

With all your just proceedings in this case

Marry God defend his Grace should say us nay

See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen

Do good my lord Your citizens entreat you

God bless your Grace We see it and will say it

Amen
