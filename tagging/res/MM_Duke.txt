


Escalus.

Of government the properties to unfold

Would seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse,

Since I am put to know that your own science

Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice

My strength can give you. Then no more remains

But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,

And let them work. The nature of our people,

Our city’s institutions, and the terms

For common justice, you’re as pregnant in

As art and practice hath enrichèd any

That we remember. There is our commission,

From which we would not have you warp.—Call hither,

I say, bid come before us Angelo.

What figure of us think you he will bear?

For you must know, we have with special soul

Elected him our absence to supply,

Lent him our terror, dressed him with our love,

And given his deputation all the organs

Of our own power. What think you of it?

Look where he comes.

Angelo,

There is a kind of character in thy life

That to th’ observer doth thy history

Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings

Are not thine own so proper as to waste

Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.

Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,

Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues

Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike

As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched

But to fine issues, nor nature never lends

The smallest scruple of her excellence

But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines

Herself the glory of a creditor,

Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech

To one that can my part in him advertise.

Hold, therefore, Angelo.

In our remove be thou at full ourself.

Mortality and mercy in Vienna

Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,

Though first in question, is thy secondary.

Take thy commission.

No more evasion.

We have with a leavened and preparèd choice

Proceeded to you. Therefore, take your honors.

Our haste from hence is of so quick condition

That it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned

Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,

As time and our concernings shall importune,

How it goes with us, and do look to know

What doth befall you here. So fare you well.

To th’ hopeful execution do I leave you

Of your commissions.

My haste may not admit it.

Nor need you, on mine honor, have to do

With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,

So to enforce or qualify the laws

As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand.

I’ll privily away. I love the people,

But do not like to stage me to their eyes.

Though it do well, I do not relish well

Their loud applause and aves vehement,

Nor do I think the man of safe discretion

That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

I thank you. Fare you well.

No, holy father, throw away that thought.

Believe not that the dribbling dart of love

Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee

To give me secret harbor hath a purpose

More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends

Of burning youth.

My holy sir, none better knows than you

How I have ever loved the life removed,

And held in idle price to haunt assemblies

Where youth and cost witless bravery keeps.

I have delivered to Lord Angelo,

A man of stricture and firm abstinence,

My absolute power and place here in Vienna,

And he supposes me traveled to Poland,

For so I have strewed it in the common ear,

And so it is received. Now, pious sir,

You will demand of me why I do this.

We have strict statutes and most biting laws,

The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,

Which for this fourteen years we have let slip,

Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave

That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,

Having bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch

Only to stick it in their children’s sight

For terror, not to use—in time the rod

More mocked than feared—so our decrees,

Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,

And liberty plucks justice by the nose,

The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart

Goes all decorum.

I do fear, too dreadful.

Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,

’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them

For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done

When evil deeds have their permissive pass

And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,

I have on Angelo imposed the office,

Who may in th’ ambush of my name strike home,

And yet my nature never in the fight

To do in slander. And to behold his sway

I will, as ’twere a brother of your order,

Visit both prince and people. Therefore I prithee

Supply me with the habit, and instruct me

How I may formally in person bear

Like a true friar. More reasons for this action

At our more leisure shall I render you.

Only this one: Lord Angelo is precise,

Stands at a guard with envy, scarce confesses

That his blood flows or that his appetite

Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,

If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

Hail to you, provost, so I think you are.

Bound by my charity and my blest order,

I come to visit the afflicted spirits

Here in the prison. Do me the common right

To let me see them, and to make me know

The nature of their crimes, that I may minister

To them accordingly.

When must he die?

Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,

And try your penitence, if it be sound

Or hollowly put on.

Love you the man that wronged you?

So then it seems your most offenseful act

Was mutually committed?

Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

’Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent

As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,

Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,

Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,

But as we stand in fear—

There rest.

Your partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow,

And I am going with instruction to him.

Grace go with you. Benedicite.

So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

Be absolute for death. Either death or life

Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:

If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing

That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,

Servile to all the skyey influences

That doth this habitation where thou keep’st

Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool,

For him thou labor’st by thy flight to shun,

And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble,

For all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st

Are nursed by baseness. Thou ’rt by no means valiant,

For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork

Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,

And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st

Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself,

For thou exists on many a thousand grains

That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,

For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,

And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain,

For thy complexion shifts to strange effects

After the moon. If thou art rich, thou ’rt poor,

For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,

Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,

And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,

For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,

The mere effusion of thy proper loins,

Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum

For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,

But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep

Dreaming on both, for all thy blessèd youth

Becomes as agèd and doth beg the alms

Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,

Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty

To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this

That bears the name of life? Yet in this life

Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,

That makes these odds all even.

Dear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again.

Provost, a word with you.

Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

Might you dispense with your leisure, I

would by and by have some speech with you. The

satisfaction I would require is likewise your own

benefit.

Son, I have overheard

what hath passed between you and your

sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her;

only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practice

his judgment with the disposition of natures. She,

having the truth of honor in her, hath made him

that gracious denial which he is most glad to

receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this

to be true. Therefore prepare yourself to death. Do

not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are

fallible. Tomorrow you must die. Go to your knees

and make ready.

Hold you there. Farewell.—Provost, a

word with you.

That now you are come, you will be

gone. Leave me awhile with the maid. My mind

promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by

my company.

The hand that hath made

you fair hath made you good. The goodness that is

cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness,

but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall

keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo

hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my

understanding; and but that frailty hath examples

for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will

you do to content this substitute and to save your

brother?

That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as

the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation:

he made trial of you only. Therefore, fasten

your ear on my advisings. To the love I have in doing

good, a remedy presents itself. I do make myself

believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor

wronged lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother

from the angry law, do no stain to your own

gracious person, and much please the absent duke,

if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing

of this business.

Virtue is bold, and goodness never

fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the

sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried

at sea?

She should this Angelo have married,

was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed.

Between which time of the contract and

limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was

wracked at sea, having in that perished vessel the

dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell

to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble

and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever

most kind and natural; with him, the portion and

sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with

both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming

Angelo.

Left her in her tears and dried not one

of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows

whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonor; in

few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which

she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her

tears, is washed with them but relents not.

It is a rupture that you may easily heal,

and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but

keeps you from dishonor in doing it.

This forenamed maid hath yet in her

the continuance of her first affection. His unjust

unkindness, that in all reason should have

quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the

current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to

Angelo, answer his requiring with a plausible obedience,

agree with his demands to the point. Only

refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay

with him may not be long, that the time may have all

shadow and silence in it, and the place answer to

convenience. This being granted in course, and

now follows all: we shall advise this wronged maid

to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If

the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may

compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is

your brother saved, your honor untainted, the poor

Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy

scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his

attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may,

the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit

from reproof. What think you of it?

It lies much in your holding up. Haste

you speedily to Angelo. If for this night he entreat

you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I

will presently to Saint Luke’s. There at the moated

grange resides this dejected Mariana. At that place

call upon me, and dispatch with Angelo that it may

be quickly.

O heavens, what stuff is here?

And you, good brother father. What

offense hath this man made you, sir?

Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!

The evil that thou causest to be done,

That is thy means to live. Do thou but think

What ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back

From such a filthy vice; say to thyself,

From their abominable and beastly touches

I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.

Canst thou believe thy living is a life,

So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,

Thou wilt prove his.—Take him to prison, officer.

Correction and instruction must both work

Ere this rude beast will profit.

That we were all, as some would seem to be,

From our faults, as faults from seeming, free.

Still thus, and thus; still worse.

And you.

I know none. Can you tell me of any?

I know not where, but wheresoever, I

wish him well.

He does well in ’t.

It is too general a vice, and severity

must cure it.

How should he be made, then?

You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

I never heard the absent duke much

detected for women. He was not inclined that way.

’Tis not possible.

You do him wrong, surely.

What, I prithee, might be the cause?

Wise? Why, no question but he was.

Either this is envy in you, folly, or

mistaking. The very stream of his life and the

business he hath helmed must, upon a warranted

need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be

but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he

shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman,

and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskillfully. Or,

if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in

your malice.

Love talks with better knowledge, and

knowledge with dearer love.

I can hardly believe that, since you

know not what you speak. But if ever the Duke

return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you

to make your answer before him. If it be honest you

have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am

bound to call upon you, and, I pray you, your name?

He shall know you better, sir, if I may

live to report you.

O, you hope the Duke will return no

more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.

But indeed I can do you little harm; you’ll

forswear this again.

Why should he die, sir?

No might nor greatness in mortality

Can censure scape. Back-wounding calumny

The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong

Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?

But who comes here?

Bliss and goodness on you.

Not of this country, though my chance is now

To use it for my time. I am a brother

Of gracious order, late come from the See

In special business from his Holiness.

None but that there is so great a fever

on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it.

Novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous to

be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be

constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth

enough alive to make societies secure, but security

enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon

this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news

is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you,

sir, of what disposition was the Duke?

What pleasure was he given to?

He professes to have received no

sinister measure from his judge but most willingly

humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet

had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his

frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by

my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now

is he resolved to die.

If his own life answer the straitness of

his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if

he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

Peace be with you.

He who the sword of heaven will bear

Should be as holy as severe,

Pattern in himself to know,

Grace to stand, and virtue go;

More nor less to others paying

Than by self-offenses weighing.

Shame to him whose cruel striking

Kills for faults of his own liking.

Twice treble shame on Angelo,

To weed my vice, and let his grow.

O, what may man within him hide,

Though angel on the outward side!

How may likeness made in crimes,

Making practice on the times,

To draw with idle spiders’ strings

Most ponderous and substantial things.

Craft against vice I must apply.

With Angelo tonight shall lie

His old betrothèd but despisèd.

So disguise shall, by th’ disguisèd,

Pay with falsehood false exacting

And perform an old contracting.

’Tis good, though music oft hath such a charm

To make bad good and good provoke to harm.

I pray you tell me, hath anybody inquired for me

here today? Much upon this time have I promised

here to meet.

I do constantly believe you. The time is

come even now. I shall crave your forbearance a

little. Maybe I will call upon you anon for some

advantage to yourself.

Very well met, and welcome.

What is the news from this good deputy?

But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

Are there no other tokens

Between you ’greed concerning her observance?

’Tis well borne up.

I have not yet made known to Mariana

A word of this.—What ho, within; come forth.

I pray you be acquainted with this maid.

She comes to do you good.

Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

Take then this your companion by the hand,

Who hath a story ready for your ear.

I shall attend your leisure. But make haste.

The vaporous night approaches.

O place and greatness, millions of false eyes

Are stuck upon thee; volumes of report

Run with these false, and, most contrarious, quest

Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit

Make thee the father of their idle dream

And rack thee in their fancies.

Welcome. How agreed?

It is not my consent

But my entreaty too.

Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.

He is your husband on a precontract.

To bring you thus together ’tis no sin,

Sith that the justice of your title to him

Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go.

Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow.

The best and wholesom’st spirits of the night

Envelop you, good provost. Who called here of late?

Not Isabel?

They will, then, ere ’t be long.

There’s some in hope.

Not so, not so. His life is paralleled

Even with the stroke and line of his great justice.

He doth with holy abstinence subdue

That in himself which he spurs on his power

To qualify in others. Were he mealed with that

Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous,

But this being so, he’s just. Now are they come.

This is a gentle provost. Seldom when

The steelèd jailer is the friend of men.

How now, what noise? That spirit’s possessed with haste

That wounds th’ unsisting postern with these strokes.

Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,

But he must die tomorrow?

As near the dawning, provost, as it is,

You shall hear more ere morning.

And here comes Claudio’s pardon.

This is his pardon, purchased by such sin

For which the pardoner himself is in.

Hence hath offense his quick celerity

When it is borne in high authority.

When vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended

That for the fault’s love is th’ offender friended.

Now, sir, what news?

Pray you let’s hear.

What is that Barnardine who is to be

executed in th’ afternoon?

How came it that the absent duke had

not either delivered him to his liberty, or executed

him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

It is now apparent?

Hath he borne himself penitently in

prison? How seems he to be touched?

He wants advice.

More of him anon. There is written in

your brow, provost, honesty and constancy; if I read

it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in the

boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.

Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is

no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo, who hath

sentenced him. To make you understand this in a

manifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite, for

the which you are to do me both a present and a

dangerous courtesy.

In the delaying death.

By the vow of mine order I warrant

you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this

Barnardine be this morning executed and his head

borne to Angelo.

O, death’s a great disguiser, and you

may add to it. Shave the head and tie the beard, and

say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared

before his death. You know the course is common.

If anything fall to you upon this, more than thanks

and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I

will plead against it with my life.

Were you sworn to the Duke or to the

Deputy?

You will think you have made no

offense if the Duke avouch the justice of your

dealing?

Not a resemblance, but a certainty; yet

since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity,

nor persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will

go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of

you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the

Duke. You know the

character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange

to you.

The contents of this is the return of the

Duke; you shall anon overread it at your pleasure,

where you shall find within these two days he will

be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for

he this very day receives letters of strange tenor,

perchance of the Duke’s death, perchance entering

into some monastery, but by chance nothing of

what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the

shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how

these things should be. All difficulties are but easy

when they are known. Call your executioner, and

off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present

shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are

amazed, but this shall absolutely resolve you.

Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

Sir, induced by my

charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I

am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with

you.

O, sir, you must. And therefore I

beseech you look forward on the journey you shall

go.

But hear you—

Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!

After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

A creature unprepared, unmeet for death,

And to transport him in the mind he is

Were damnable.

O, ’tis an accident that heaven provides!

Dispatch it presently. The hour draws on

Prefixed by Angelo. See this be done

And sent according to command, whiles I

Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

Let this be done:

Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio.

Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting

To yonder generation, you shall find

Your safety manifested.

Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.

Now will I write letters to Angelo—

The Provost he shall bear them—whose contents

Shall witness to him I am near at home

And that by great injunctions I am bound

To enter publicly. Him I’ll desire

To meet me at the consecrated fount

A league below the city; and from thence,

By cold gradation and well-balanced form,

We shall proceed with Angelo.

Convenient is it. Make a swift return,

For I would commune with you of such things

That want no ear but yours.

The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know

If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither.

But I will keep her ignorant of her good

To make her heavenly comforts of despair

When it is least expected.

Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

He hath released him, Isabel, from the world.

His head is off, and sent to Angelo.

It is no other.

Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience.

You shall not be admitted to his sight.

This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot.

Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.

Mark what I say, which you shall find

By every syllable a faithful verity.

The Duke comes home tomorrow—nay, dry your eyes.

One of our convent, and his confessor,

Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried

Notice to Escalus and Angelo,

Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,

There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom

In that good path that I would wish it go,

And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,

Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,

And general honor.

This letter, then, to Friar Peter give.

’Tis that he sent me of the Duke’s return.

Say, by this token, I desire his company

At Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours

I’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you

Before the Duke, and to the head of Angelo

Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,

I am combinèd by a sacred vow

And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.

Command these fretting waters from your eyes

With a light heart. Trust not my holy order

If I pervert your course.—Who’s here?

Not within, sir.

Sir, the Duke is marvelous little beholding

to your reports, but the best is, he lives not

in them.

Well, you’ll answer this one day. Fare

you well.

You have told me too many of him

already, sir, if they be true; if not true, none were

enough.

Did you such a thing?

Sir, your company is fairer than honest.

Rest you well.

These letters at fit time deliver me.

The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.

The matter being afoot, keep your instruction

And hold you ever to our special drift,

Though sometimes you do blench from this to that

As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius’ house

And tell him where I stay. Give the like notice

To Valencius, Rowland, and to Crassus,

And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate.

But send me Flavius first.

I thank thee, Varrius. Thou hast made good haste.

Come, we will walk. There’s other of our friends

Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius.

My very worthy cousin, fairly met.

Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

Many and hearty thankings to you both.

We have made inquiry of you, and we hear

Such goodness of your justice that our soul

Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,

Forerunning more requital.

O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it

To lock it in the wards of covert bosom

When it deserves with characters of brass

A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time

And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand

And let the subject see, to make them know

That outward courtesies would fain proclaim

Favors that keep within.—Come, Escalus,

You must walk by us on our other hand.

And good supporters are you.

Relate your wrongs. In what, by whom? Be brief.

Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice.

Reveal yourself to him.

Nay, it is ten times strange.

Away with her. Poor soul,

She speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense.

By mine honesty,

If she be mad—as I believe no other—

Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,

Such a dependency of thing on thing,

As e’er I heard in madness.

Many that are not mad

Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

You were not bid to speak.

I wish you now, then.

Pray you take note of it, and when you have

A business for yourself, pray heaven you then

Be perfect.

The warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to ’t.

It may be right, but you are i’ the wrong

To speak before your time.—Proceed.

That’s somewhat madly spoken.

Mended again. The matter; proceed.

This is most likely!

By heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what thou speak’st,

Or else thou art suborned against his honor

In hateful practice. First, his integrity

Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason

That with such vehemency he should pursue

Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,

He would have weighed thy brother by himself

And not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on.

Confess the truth, and say by whose advice

Thou cam’st here to complain.

I know you’d fain be gone.—An officer!

To prison with her. Shall we thus permit

A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall

On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.—

Who knew of your intent and coming hither?

A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

Words against me? This’ a good friar, belike.

And to set on this wretched woman here

Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

We did believe no less.

Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

Good friar, let’s hear it.—

Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?

O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!—

Give us some seats.—Come, cousin Angelo,

In this I’ll be impartial. Be you judge

Of your own cause.    Is this the witness, friar?

First, let her show her face, and after speak.

What, are you married?

Are you a maid?

A widow, then?

Why you are nothing, then, neither maid, widow,

nor wife?

Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause

to prattle for himself.

For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so

too.

This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

No? You say your husband.

Know you this woman?

Sirrah, no more.

Ay, with my heart,

And punish them to your height of pleasure.—

Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,

Compact with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy oaths,

Though they would swear down each particular saint,

Were testimonies against his worth and credit

That’s sealed in approbation?—You, Lord Escalus,

Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains

To find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived.

There is another friar that set them on.

Let him be sent for.

Go, do it instantly.

And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,

Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,

Do with your injuries as seems you best

In any chastisement. I for a while

Will leave you; but stir not you till you have

Well determined upon these slanderers.

’Tis false.

Respect to your great place, and let the devil

Be sometime honored for his burning throne.

Where is the Duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak.

Boldly, at least.—But, O, poor souls,

Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?

Good night to your redress. Is the Duke gone?

Then is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust

Thus to retort your manifest appeal,

And put your trial in the villain’s mouth

Which here you come to accuse.

Be not so hot. The Duke

Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he

Dare rack his own. His subject am I not,

Nor here provincial. My business in this state

Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,

Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble

Till it o’errun the stew. Laws for all faults,

But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes

Stand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop,

As much in mock as mark.

I remember you, sir, by the sound of

your voice. I met you at the prison in the absence of

the Duke.

Most notedly, sir.

You must, sir, change persons with me

ere you make that my report. You indeed spoke so

of him, and much more, much worse.

I protest I love the Duke as I love

myself.

Stay, sir, stay awhile.

Thou art the first knave that e’er mad’st a duke.—

First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.

Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you

Must have a word anon.—Lay hold on him.

What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down.

We’ll borrow place of him. Sir, by your leave.

Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence

That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,

Rely upon it till my tale be heard,

And hold no longer out.

Come hither, Mariana.

Say, wast thou e’er contracted to this woman?

Go take her hence and marry her instantly.

Do you the office, friar, which consummate,

Return him here again.—Go with him, provost.

Come hither, Isabel.

Your friar is now your prince. As I was then

Advertising and holy to your business,

Not changing heart with habit, I am still

Attorneyed at your service.

You are pardoned, Isabel.

And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.

Your brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart,

And you may marvel why I obscured myself,

Laboring to save his life, and would not rather

Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power

Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,

It was the swift celerity of his death,

Which I did think with slower foot came on,

That brained my purpose. But peace be with him.

That life is better life past fearing death

Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,

So happy is your brother.

For this new-married man approaching here,

Whose salt imagination yet hath wronged

Your well-defended honor, you must pardon

For Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your brother—

Being criminal in double violation

Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach

Thereon dependent for your brother’s life—

The very mercy of the law cries out

Most audible, even from his proper tongue,

“An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.”

Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;

Like doth quit like, and measure still for measure.—

Then, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested,

Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.

We do condemn thee to the very block

Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like haste.—

Away with him.

It is your husband mocked you with a husband.

Consenting to the safeguard of your honor,

I thought your marriage fit. Else imputation,

For that he knew you, might reproach your life

And choke your good to come. For his possessions,

Although by confiscation they are ours,

We do instate and widow you with all

To buy you a better husband.

Never crave him. We are definitive.

You do but lose your labor.—

Away with him to death. Now, sir, to you.

Against all sense you do importune her.

Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,

Her brother’s ghost his pavèd bed would break

And take her hence in horror.

He dies for Claudio’s death.

Your suit’s unprofitable. Stand up, I say.

I have bethought me of another fault.—

Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded

At an unusual hour?

Had you a special warrant for the deed?

For which I do discharge you of your office.

Give up your keys.

What’s he?

I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.

Go fetch him hither. Let me look upon him.

Which is that Barnardine?

There was a friar told me of this man.—

Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul

That apprehends no further than this world,

And squar’st thy life according. Thou ’rt condemned.

But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,

And pray thee take this mercy to provide

For better times to come.—Friar, advise him.

I leave him to your hand.—What muffled fellow’s that?

If he be like your brother, for his sake

Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake,

Give me your hand and say you will be mine,

He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.

By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe;

Methinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.—

Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.

Look that you love your wife, her worth worth yours.

I find an apt remission in myself.

And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon.

You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,

One all of luxury, an ass, a madman.

Wherein have I so deserved of you

That you extol me thus?

Whipped first, sir, and hanged after.—

Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,

If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow—

As I have heard him swear himself there’s one

Whom he begot with child—let her appear,

And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,

Let him be whipped and hanged.

Upon mine honor, thou shalt marry her.

Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal

Remit thy other forfeits.—Take him to prison,

And see our pleasure herein executed.

Slandering a prince deserves it.

She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore.—

Joy to you, Mariana.—Love her, Angelo.

I have confessed her, and I know her virtue.—

Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness.

There’s more behind that is more gratulate.—

Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy.

We shall employ thee in a worthier place.—

Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home

The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s.

Th’ offense pardons itself.—Dear Isabel,

I have a motion much imports your good,

Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,

What’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.—

So, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show

What’s yet behind that’s meet you all should know.
