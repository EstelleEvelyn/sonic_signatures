So that from point to point now have you heard

The fundamental reasons of this war

Whose great decision hath much blood let forth

And more thirsts after

Therefore we marvel much our cousin France

Would in so just a business shut his bosom

Against our borrowing prayers

Be it his pleasure

Welcome shall they be

And all the honors that can fly from us

Shall on them settle You know your places well

When better fall for your avails they fell

Tomorrow to th' field

The general of our horse thou art and we

Great in our hope lay our best love and credence

Upon thy promising fortune

Then go thou forth

And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm

As thy auspicious mistress
