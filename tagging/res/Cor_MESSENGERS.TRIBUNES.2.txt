


You are sent for to the Senate

A fearful army led by Caius Martius

Associated with Aufidius rages

Upon our territories and have already

O'erborne their way consumed with fire and took

What lay before them

Good news good news The ladies have prevailed

The Volscians are dislodged and Martius gone

A merrier day did never yet greet Rome

No not th' expulsion of the Tarquins

As certain as I know the sun is fire

Where have you lurked that you make doubt of it

Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide

As the recomforted through th' gates Why hark you

The trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes

Tabors and cymbals and the shouting Romans

Make the sun dance Hark you

Sir we have all great cause to give great thanks

Almost at point to enter
