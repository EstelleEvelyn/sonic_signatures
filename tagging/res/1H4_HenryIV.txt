


So shaken as we are so wan with care

Find we a time for frighted peace to pant

And breathe short-winded accents of new broils

To be commenced in strands afar remote

No more the thirsty entrance of this soil

Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood

No more shall trenching war channel her fields

Nor bruise her flow'rets with the armd hoofs

Of hostile paces Those opposd eyes

Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven

All of one nature of one substance bred

Did lately meet in the intestine shock

And furious close of civil butchery

Shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks

March all one way and be no more opposed

Against acquaintance kindred and allies

The edge of war like an ill-sheathd knife

No more shall cut his master Therefore friends

As far as to the sepulcher of Christ

Whose soldier now under whose blessd cross

We are impressd and engaged to fight

Forthwith a power of English shall we levy

Whose arms were molded in their mothers' womb

To chase these pagans in those holy fields

Over whose acres walked those blessd feet

Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed

For our advantage on the bitter cross

But this our purpose now is twelve month old

And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go

Therefor we meet not now Then let me hear

Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland

What yesternight our council did decree

In forwarding this dear expedience

It seems then that the tidings of this broil

Brake off our business for the Holy Land

Here is a dear a true-industrious friend

Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse

Stained with the variation of each soil

Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours

And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news

The Earl of Douglas is discomfited

Ten thousand bold Scots two-and-twenty knights

Balked in their own blood did Sir Walter see

On Holmedon's plains Of prisoners Hotspur took

Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son

To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Atholl

Of Murray Angus and Menteith

And is not this an honorable spoil

A gallant prize Ha cousin is it not

Yea there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin

In envy that my Lord Northumberland

Should be the father to so blest a son

A son who is the theme of Honor's tongue

Amongst a grove the very straightest plant

Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride

Whilst I by looking on the praise of him

See riot and dishonor stain the brow

Of my young Harry O that it could be proved

That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged

In cradle-clothes our children where they lay

And called mine Percy his Plantagenet

Then would I have his Harry and he mine

But let him from my thoughts What think you coz

Of this young Percy's pride The prisoners

Which he in this adventure hath surprised

To his own use he keeps and sends me word

I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife

But I have sent for him to answer this

And for this cause awhile we must neglect

Our holy purpose to Jerusalem

Cousin on Wednesday next our council we

Will hold at Windsor So inform the lords

But come yourself with speed to us again

For more is to be said and to be done

Than out of anger can be utterd

My blood hath been too cold and temperate

Unapt to stir at these indignities

And you have found me for accordingly

You tread upon my patience But be sure

I will from henceforth rather be myself

Mighty and to be feared than my condition

Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down

And therefore lost that title of respect

Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud

Worcester get thee gone for I do see

Danger and disobedience in thine eye

O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory

And majesty might never yet endure

The moody frontier of a servant brow

You have good leave to leave us When we need

Your use and counsel we shall send for you

You were about to speak

Why yet he doth deny his prisoners

But with proviso and exception

That we at our own charge shall ransom straight

His brother-in-law the foolish Mortimer

Who on my soul hath willfully betrayed

The lives of those that he did lead to fight

Against that great magician damned Glendower

Whose daughter as we hear that Earl of March

Hath lately married Shall our coffers then

Be emptied to redeem a traitor home

Shall we buy treason and indent with fears

When they have lost and forfeited themselves

No on the barren mountains let him starve

For I shall never hold that man my friend

Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost

To ransom home revolted Mortimer

Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him

He never did encounter with Glendower

I tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone

As Owen Glendower for an enemy

Art thou not ashamed But sirrah henceforth

Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer

Send me your prisoners with the speediest means

Or you shall hear in such a kind from me

As will displease youMy lord Northumberland

We license your departure with your son

Send us your prisoners or you will hear of it

Lords give us leave the Prince of Wales and I

Must have some private conference but be near at hand

For we shall presently have need of you

I know not whether God will have it so

For some displeasing service I have done

That in His secret doom out of my blood

He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me

But thou dost in thy passages of life

Make me believe that thou art only marked

For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven

To punish my mistreadings Tell me else

Could such inordinate and low desires

Such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts

Such barren pleasures rude society

As thou art matched withal and grafted to

Accompany the greatness of thy blood

And hold their level with thy princely heart

God pardon thee Yet let me wonder Harry

At thy affections which do hold a wing

Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors

Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost

Which by thy younger brother is supplied

And art almost an alien to the hearts

Of all the court and princes of my blood

The hope and expectation of thy time

Is ruined and the soul of every man

Prophetically do forethink thy fall

Had I so lavish of my presence been

So common-hackneyed in the eyes of men

So stale and cheap to vulgar company

Opinion that did help me to the crown

Had still kept loyal to possession

And left me in reputeless banishment

A fellow of no mark nor likelihood

By being seldom seen I could not stir

But like a comet I was wondered at

That men would tell their children This is he

Others would say Where Which is Bolingbroke

And then I stole all courtesy from heaven

And dressed myself in such humility

That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts

Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths

Even in the presence of the crownd king

Thus did I keep my person fresh and new

My presence like a robe pontifical

Ne'er seen but wondered at and so my state

Seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast

And won by rareness such solemnity

The skipping king he ambled up and down

With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits

Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state

Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools

Had his great name profand with their scorns

And gave his countenance against his name

To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push

Of every beardless vain comparative

Grew a companion to the common streets

Enfeoffed himself to popularity

That being daily swallowed by men's eyes

They surfeited with honey and began

To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little

More than a little is by much too much

So when he had occasion to be seen

He was but as the cuckoo is in June

Heard not regarded seen but with such eyes

As sick and blunted with community

Afford no extraordinary gaze

Such as is bent on sunlike majesty

When it shines seldom in admiring eyes

But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down

Slept in his face and rendered such aspect

As cloudy men use to their adversaries

Being with his presence glutted gorged and full

And in that very line Harry standest thou

For thou hast lost thy princely privilege

With vile participation Not an eye

But is aweary of thy common sight

Save mine which hath desired to see thee more

Which now doth that I would not have it do

Make blind itself with foolish tenderness

For all the world

As thou art to this hour was Richard then

When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh

And even as I was then is Percy now

Now by my scepter and my soul to boot

He hath more worthy interest to the state

Than thou the shadow of succession

For of no right nor color like to right

He doth fill fields with harness in the realm

Turns head against the lion's armd jaws

And being no more in debt to years than thou

Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on

To bloody battles and to bruising arms

What never-dying honor hath he got

Against renownd Douglas whose high deeds

Whose hot incursions and great name in arms

Holds from all soldiers chief majority

And military title capital

Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ

Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swaddling clothes

This infant warrior in his enterprises

Discomfited great Douglas ta'en him once

Enlargd him and made a friend of him

To fill the mouth of deep defiance up

And shake the peace and safety of our throne

And what say you to this Percy Northumberland

The Archbishop's Grace of York Douglas Mortimer

Capitulate against us and are up

But wherefore do I tell these news to thee

Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes

Which art my nearest and dearest enemy

Thou that art like enough through vassal fear

Base inclination and the start of spleen

To fight against me under Percy's pay

To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns

To show how much thou art degenerate

A hundred thousand rebels die in this

Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein

How now good Blunt Thy looks are full of speed

The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today

With him my son Lord John of Lancaster

For this advertisement is five days old

On Wednesday next Harry you shall set forward

On Thursday we ourselves will march Our meeting

Is Bridgenorth And Harry you shall march

Through Gloucestershire by which account

Our business valud some twelve days hence

Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet

Our hands are full of business Let's away

Advantage feeds him fat while men delay

How bloodily the sun begins to peer

Above yon bulky hill The day looks pale

At his distemp'rature

Then with the losers let it sympathize

For nothing can seem foul to those that win

How now my Lord of Worcester 'Tis not well

That you and I should meet upon such terms

As now we meet You have deceived our trust

And made us doff our easy robes of peace

To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel

This is not well my lord this is not well

What say you to it Will you again unknit

This churlish knot of all-abhorrd war

And move in that obedient orb again

Where you did give a fair and natural light

And be no more an exhaled meteor

A prodigy of fear and a portent

Of broachd mischief to the unborn times

You have not sought it How comes it then

These things indeed you have articulate

Proclaimed at market crosses read in churches

To face the garment of rebellion

With some fine color that may please the eye

Of fickle changelings and poor discontents

Which gape and rub the elbow at the news

Of hurlyburly innovation

And never yet did insurrection want

Such water colors to impaint his cause

Nor moody beggars starving for a time

Of pellmell havoc and confusion

And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee

Albeit considerations infinite

Do make against itNo good Worcester no

We love our people well even those we love

That are misled upon your cousin's part

And will they take the offer of our grace

Both he and they and you yea every man

Shall be my friend again and I'll be his

So tell your cousin and bring me word

What he will do But if he will not yield

Rebuke and dread correction wait on us

And they shall do their office So begone

We will not now be troubled with reply

We offer fair Take it advisedly

Hence therefore every leader to his charge

For on their answer will we set on them

And God befriend us as our cause is just

I prithee Harry withdraw thyself Thou bleedest too much

Lord John of Lancaster go you with him

I will do soMy Lord of Westmoreland

Lead him to his tent

I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point

With lustier maintenance than I did look for

Of such an ungrown warrior

The King himself who Douglas grieves at heart

So many of his shadows thou hast met

And not the very king I have two boys

Seek Percy and thyself about the field

But seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily

I will assay thee And defend thyself

Stay and breathe awhile

Thou hast redeemed thy lost opinion

And showed thou mak'st some tender of my life

In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me

Make up to Clifton I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey

Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke

Ill-spirited Worcester did not we send grace

Pardon and terms of love to all of you

And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary

Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust

Three knights upon our party slain today

A noble earl and many a creature else

Had been alive this hour

If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne

Betwixt our armies true intelligence

Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too

Other offenders we will pause upon

How goes the field

With all my heart

Then this remains that we divide our power

You son John and my cousin Westmoreland

Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed

To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop

Who as we hear are busily in arms

Myself and you son Harry will towards Wales

To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March

Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway

Meeting the check of such another day

And since this business so fair is done

Let us not leave till all our own be won
