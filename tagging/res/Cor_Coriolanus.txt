


ThanksWhat's the matter you dissentious rogues

That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion

Make yourselves scabs

He that will give good words to thee will flatter

Beneath abhorring What would you have you curs

That like nor peace nor war The one affrights you

The other makes you proud He that trusts to you

Where he should find you lions finds you hares

Where foxes geese You are no surer no

Than is the coal of fire upon the ice

Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is

To make him worthy whose offense subdues him

And curse that justice did it Who deserves greatness

Deserves your hate and your affections are

A sick man's appetite who desires most that

Which would increase his evil He that depends

Upon your favors swims with fins of lead

And hews down oaks with rushes Hang you Trust you

With every minute you do change a mind

And call him noble that was now your hate

Him vile that was your garland What's the matter

That in these several places of the city

You cry against the noble senate who

Under the gods keep you in awe which else

Would feed on one anotherWhat's their seeking

Hang 'em They say

They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know

What's done i' th' Capitol who's like to rise

Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out

Conjectural marriages making parties strong

And feebling such as stand not in their liking

Below their cobbled shoes They say there's grain enough

Would the nobility lay aside their ruth

And let me use my sword I'd make a quarry

With thousands of these quartered slaves as high

As I could pick my lance

They are dissolved Hang 'em

They said they were an-hungry sighed forth proverbs

That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat

That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not

Corn for the rich men only With these shreds

They vented their complainings which being answered

And a petition granted thema strange one

To break the heart of generosity

And make bold power look palethey threw their caps

As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon

Shouting their emulation

Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms

Of their own choice One's Junius Brutus

Sicinius Velutus and I know not 'Sdeath

The rabble should have first unroofed the city

Ere so prevailed with me It will in time

Win upon power and throw forth greater themes

For insurrection's arguing

Go get you home you fragments

Here What's the matter

I am glad on 't Then we shall ha' means to vent

Our musty superfluity    See our best elders

They have a leader

Tullus Aufidius that will put you to 't

I sin in envying his nobility

And were I anything but what I am

I would wish me only he

Were half to half the world by th' ears and he

Upon my party I'd revolt to make

Only my wars with him He is a lion

That I am proud to hunt

Sir it is

And I am constantTitus Lartius thou

Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face

What art thou stiff Stand'st out

Nay let them follow

The Volsces have much corn take these rats thither

To gnaw their garners  Worshipful mutineers

Your valor puts well forthPray follow

Yonder comes news A wager they have met

'Tis done

Say has our general met the enemy

I'll buy him of you

How far off lie these armies

Then shall we hear their 'larum and they ours

Now Mars I prithee make us quick in work

That we with smoking swords may march from hence

To help our fielded friendsCome blow thy blast

Tullus Aufidius is he within your walls

O they are at it

They fear us not but issue forth their city

Now put your shields before your hearts and fight

With hearts more proof than shieldsAdvance brave Titus

They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts

Which makes me sweat with wrathCome on my fellows

He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce

And he shall feel mine edge

All the contagion of the south light on you

You shames of Rome You herd ofBoils and plagues

Plaster you o'er that you may be abhorred

Farther than seen and one infect another

Against the wind a mile You souls of geese

That bear the shapes of men how have you run

From slaves that apes would beat Pluto and hell

All hurt behind Backs red and faces pale

With flight and agued fear Mend and charge home

Or by the fires of heaven I'll leave the foe

And make my wars on you Look to 't Come on

If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives

As they us to our trenches Follow 's

So now the gates are ope Now prove good seconds

'Tis for the followers fortune widens them

Not for the fliers Mark me and do the like

See here these movers that do prize their hours

At a cracked drachma Cushions leaden spoons

Irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would

Bury with those that wore them these base slaves

Ere yet the fight be done pack up Down with them

And hark what noise the General makes To him

There is the man of my soul's hate Aufidius

Piercing our Romans Then valiant Titus take

Convenient numbers to make good the city

Whilst I with those that have the spirit will haste

To help Cominius

Sir praise me not

My work hath yet not warmed me Fare you well

The blood I drop is rather physical

Than dangerous to me To Aufidius thus

I will appear and fight

Thy friend no less

Than those she placeth highest So farewell

Come I too late

Come I too late

O let me clip you

In arms as sound as when I wooed in heart

As merry as when our nuptial day was done

And tapers burnt to bedward

As with a man busied about decrees

Condemning some to death and some to exile

Ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th' other

Holding Corioles in the name of Rome

Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash

To let him slip at will

Let him alone

He did inform the truth But for our gentlemen

The common filea plague Tribunes for them

The mouse ne'er shunned the cat as they did budge

From rascals worse than they

Will the time serve to tell I do not think

Where is the enemy Are you lords o' th' field

If not why cease you till you are so

How lies their battle Know you on which side

They have placed their men of trust

I do beseech you

By all the battles wherein we have fought

By th' blood we have shed together by th' vows we have made

To endure friends that you directly set me

Against Aufidius and his Antiates

And that you not delay the present but

Filling the air with swords advanced and darts

We prove this very hour

Those are they

That most are willing If any such be here

As it were sin to doubtthat love this painting

Wherein you see me smeared if any fear

Lesser his person than an ill report

If any think brave death outweighs bad life

And that his country's dearer than himself

Let him alone or so many so minded

Wave thus to express his disposition

And follow Martius

O me alone Make you a sword of me

If these shows be not outward which of you

But is four Volsces None of you but is

Able to bear against the great Aufidius

A shield as hard as his A certain number

Though thanks to all must I select from all

The rest shall bear the business in some other fight

As cause will be obeyed Please you to march

And I shall quickly draw out my command

Which men are best inclined

I'll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee

Worse than a promise-breaker

Let the first budger die the other's slave

And the gods doom him after

Within these three hours Tullus

Alone I fought in your Corioles' walls

And made what work I pleased 'Tis not my blood

Wherein thou seest me masked For thy revenge

Wrench up thy power to th' highest

Pray now no more My mother

Who has a charter to extol her blood

When she does praise me grieves me I have done

As you have donethat's what I can

Induced as you have beenthat's for my country

He that has but effected his good will

Hath overta'en mine act

I have some wounds upon me and they smart

To hear themselves remembered

I thank you general

But cannot make my heart consent to take

A bribe to pay my sword I do refuse it

And stand upon my common part with those

That have beheld the doing

May these same instruments which you profane

Never sound more When drums and trumpets shall

I' th' field prove flatterers let courts and cities be

Made all of false-faced soothing When steel grows

Soft as the parasite's silk let him be made

An ovator for th' wars No more I say

For that I have not washed my nose that bled

Or foiled some debile wretchwhich without note

Here's many else have doneyou shout me forth

In acclamations hyperbolical

As if I loved my little should be dieted

In praises sauced with lies

I will go wash

And when my face is fair you shall perceive

Whether I blush or no Howbeit I thank you

I mean to stride your steed and at all times

To undercrest your good addition

To th' fairness of my power

The gods begin to mock me I that now

Refused most princely gifts am bound to beg

Of my lord general

I sometime lay here in Corioles

At a poor man's house he used me kindly

He cried to me I saw him prisoner

But then Aufidius was within my view

And wrath o'erwhelmed my pity I request you

To give my poor host freedom

By Jupiter forgot

I am weary yea my memory is tired

Have we no wine here

No more of this It does offend my heart

Pray now no more

O

You have I know petitioned all the gods

For my prosperity

My gracious silence hail

Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home

That weep'st to see me triumph Ah my dear

Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear

And mothers that lack sons

And live you yet O my sweet lady pardon

Menenius ever ever

Your hand and yours

Ere in our own house I do shade my head

The good patricians must be visited

From whom I have received not only greetings

But with them change of honors

Know good mother

I had rather be their servant in my way

Than sway with them in theirs

Your Honors pardon

I had rather have my wounds to heal again

Than hear say how I got them

No sir Yet oft

When blows have made me stay I fled from words

You soothed not therefore hurt not but your people

I love them as they weigh

I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun

When the alarum were struck than idly sit

To hear my nothings monstered

I do owe them still

My life and services

I do beseech you

Let me o'erleap that custom for I cannot

Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them

For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage Please you

That I may pass this doing

It is a part

That I shall blush in acting and might well

Be taken from the people

To brag unto them Thus I did and thus

Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide

As if I had received them for the hire

Of their breath only

What must I say

I pray sirplague upon 't I cannot bring

My tongue to such a pace Look sir my wounds

I got them in my country's service when

Some certain of your brethren roared and ran

From th' noise of our own drums

Think upon me Hang 'em

I would they would forget me like the virtues

Which our divines lose by 'em

Bid them wash their faces

And keep their teeth clean   So here comes a brace

You know the cause sir of my standing here

Mine own desert

Ay but not mine own desire

No sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble

the poor with begging

Well then I pray your price o' th'

consulship

Kindly sir I pray let me ha 't I have

wounds to show you which shall be yours in

privateYour good voice sir What say you

A match sir There's in all two worthy

voices begged I have your alms Adieu

Pray you now if it may stand with the

tune of your voices that I may be consul I have

here the customary gown

Your enigma

You should account me the more virtuous

that I have not been common in my love I will sir

flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a

dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account

gentle And since the wisdom of their choice

is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practice

the insinuating nod and be off to them most

counterfeitly That is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment

of some popular man and give it bountiful

to the desirers Therefore beseech you I may

be consul

I will not seal your knowledge with showing

them I will make much of your voices and so

trouble you no farther

Most sweet voices

Better it is to die better to starve

Than crave the hire which first we do deserve

Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here

To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear

Their needless vouches Custom calls me to 't

What custom wills in all things should we do 't

The dust on antique time would lie unswept

And mountainous error be too highly heaped

For truth to o'erpeer Rather than fool it so

Let the high office and the honor go

To one that would do thus I am half through

The one part suffered the other will I do

Here come more voices

Your voices For your voices I have fought

Watched for your voices for your voices bear

Of wounds two dozen odd Battles thrice six

I have seen and heard of for your voices have

Done many things some less some more Your voices

Indeed I would be consul

Worthy voices

Is this done

Where At the Senate House

May I change these garments

That I'll straight do and knowing myself again

Repair to th' Senate House

Tullus Aufidius then had made new head

So then the Volsces stand but as at first

Ready when time shall prompt them to make road

Upon 's again

Saw you Aufidius

Spoke he of me

How What

At Antium lives he

I wish I had a cause to seek him there

To oppose his hatred fully Welcome home

Behold these are the tribunes of the people

The tongues o' th' common mouth I do despise them

For they do prank them in authority

Against all noble sufferance

Ha What is that

What makes this change

Have I had children's voices

Are these your herd

Must these have voices that can yield them now

And straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices

You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth

Have you not set them on

It is a purposed thing and grows by plot

To curb the will of the nobility

Suffer 't and live with such as cannot rule

Nor ever will be ruled

Why this was known before

Have you informed them sithence

Why then should I be consul By yond clouds

Let me deserve so ill as you and make me

Your fellow tribune

Tell me of corn

This was my speech and I will speak 't again

Now as I live I will

My nobler friends I crave their pardons For

The mutable rank-scented meiny let them

Regard me as I do not flatter and

Therein behold themselves I say again

In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate

The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition

Which we ourselves have plowed for sowed and scattered

By mingling them with us the honored number

Who lack not virtue no nor power but that

Which they have given to beggars

How No more

As for my country I have shed my blood

Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs

Coin words till their decay against those measles

Which we disdain should tetter us yet sought

The very way to catch them

Choler

Were I as patient as the midnight sleep

By Jove 'twould be my mind

Shall remain

Hear you this Triton of the minnows Mark you

His absolute shall

Shall

O good but most unwise patricians why

You grave but reckless senators have you thus

Given Hydra here to choose an officer

That with his peremptory shall being but

The horn and noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit

To say he'll turn your current in a ditch

And make your channel his If he have power

Then vail your ignorance if none awake

Your dangerous lenity If you are learned

Be not as common fools if you are not

Let them have cushions by you You are plebeians

If they be senators and they are no less

When both your voices blended the great'st taste

Most palates theirs They choose their magistrate

And such a one as he who puts his shall

His popular shall against a graver bench

Than ever frowned in Greece By Jove himself

It makes the consuls base And my soul aches

To know when two authorities are up

Neither supreme how soon confusion

May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take

The one by th' other

Whoever gave that counsel to give forth

The corn o' th' storehouse gratis as 'twas used

Sometime in Greece

Though there the people had more absolute power

I say they nourished disobedience fed

The ruin of the state

I'll give my reasons

More worthier than their voices They know the corn

Was not our recompense resting well assured

They ne'er did service for 't Being pressed to th' war

Even when the navel of the state was touched

They would not thread the gates This kind of service

Did not deserve corn gratis Being i' th' war

Their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed

Most valor spoke not for them Th' accusation

Which they have often made against the Senate

All cause unborn could never be the native

Of our so frank donation Well what then

How shall this bosom multiplied digest

The Senate's courtesy Let deeds express

What's like to be their words We did request it

We are the greater poll and in true fear

They gave us our demands Thus we debase

The nature of our seats and make the rabble

Call our cares fears which will in time

Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in

The crows to peck the eagles

No take more

What may be sworn by both divine and human

Seal what I end withal This double worship

Where one part does disdain with cause the other

Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom

Cannot conclude but by the yea and no

Of general ignoranceit must omit

Real necessities and give way the while

To unstable slightness Purpose so barred it follows

Nothing is done to purpose Therefore beseech you

You that will be less fearful than discreet

That love the fundamental part of state

More than you doubt the change on 't that prefer

A noble life before a long and wish

To jump a body with a dangerous physic

That's sure of death without itat once pluck out

The multitudinous tongue let them not lick

The sweet which is their poison Your dishonor

Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state

Of that integrity which should become 't

Not having the power to do the good it would

For th' ill which doth control 't

Thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee

What should the people do with these bald tribunes

On whom depending their obedience fails

To th' greater bench In a rebellion

When what's not meet but what must be was law

Then were they chosen In a better hour

Let what is meet be said it must be meet

And throw their power i' th' dust

Hence old goat

Hence rotten thing or I shall shake thy bones

Out of thy garments

That is the way to lay the city flat

To bring the roof to the foundation

And bury all which yet distinctly ranges

In heaps and piles of ruin

No I'll die here

There's some among you have beheld me fighting

Come try upon yourselves what you have seen me

Stand fast

We have as many friends as enemies

I would they were barbarians as they are

Though in Rome littered not Romans as they are not

Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol

On fair ground

I could beat forty of them

Let them pull all about mine ears present me

Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels

Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock

That the precipitation might down stretch

Below the beam of sight yet will I still

Be thus to them

I muse my mother

Does not approve me further who was wont

To call them woolen vassals things created

To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads

In congregations to yawn be still and wonder

When one but of my ordinance stood up

To speak of peace or war    I talk of you

Why did you wish me milder Would you have me

False to my nature Rather say I play

The man I am

Let go

Let them hang

What must I do

Well what then What then

For them I cannot do it to the gods

Must I then do 't to them

Tush tush

Why force you this

Must I go show them my unbarbd sconce Must I

With my base tongue give to my noble heart

A lie that it must bear Well I will do 't

Yet were there but this single plot to lose

This mold of Martius they to dust should grind it

And throw 't against the wind To th' marketplace

You have put me now to such a part which never

I shall discharge to th' life

Well I must do 't

Away my disposition and possess me

Some harlot's spirit My throat of war be turned

Which choird with my drum into a pipe

Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice

That babies lull asleep The smiles of knaves

Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up

The glasses of my sight A beggar's tongue

Make motion through my lips and my armed knees

Who bowed but in my stirrup bend like his

That hath received an alms I will not do 't

Lest I surcease to honor mine own truth

And by my body's action teach my mind

A most inherent baseness

Pray be content

Mother I am going to the marketplace

Chide me no more I'll mountebank their loves

Cog their hearts from them and come home beloved

Of all the trades in Rome Look I am going

Commend me to my wife I'll return consul

Or never trust to what my tongue can do

I' th' way of flattery further

The word is mildly Pray you let us go

Let them accuse me by invention I

Will answer in mine honor

Well mildly be it then Mildly

Ay as an hostler that for th' poorest piece

Will bear the knave by th' volumeTh' honored gods

Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice

Supplied with worthy men Plant love among 's

Throng our large temples with the shows of peace

And not our streets with war

First hear me speak

Shall I be charged no further than this present

Must all determine here

I am content

Scratches with briars

Scars to move laughter only

What is the matter

That being passed for consul with full voice

I am so dishonored that the very hour

You take it off again

Say then 'Tis true I ought so

How Traitor

The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people

Call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune

Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths

In thy hands clutched as many millions in

Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say

Thou liest unto thee with a voice as free

As I do pray the gods

What do you prate of service

You

I'll know no further

Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death

Vagabond exile flaying pent to linger

But with a grain a day I would not buy

Their mercy at the price of one fair word

Nor check my courage for what they can give

To have 't with saying Good morrow

You common cry of curs whose breath I hate

As reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves I prize

As the dead carcasses of unburied men

That do corrupt my air I banish you

And here remain with your uncertainty

Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts

Your enemies with nodding of their plumes

Fan you into despair Have the power still

To banish your defenders till at length

Your ignorancewhich finds not till it feels

Making but reservation of yourselves

Still your own foesdeliver you

As most abated captives to some nation

That won you without blows Despising

For you the city thus I turn my back

There is a world elsewhere

Come leave your tears A brief farewell The beast

With many heads butts me away Nay mother

Where is your ancient courage You were used

To say extremities was the trier of spirits

That common chances common men could bear

That when the sea was calm all boats alike

Showed mastership in floating fortune's blows

When most struck home being gentle wounded craves

A noble cunning You were used to load me

With precepts that would make invincible

The heart that conned them

Nay I prithee woman

What what what

I shall be loved when I am lacked Nay mother

Resume that spirit when you were wont to say

If you had been the wife of Hercules

Six of his labors you'd have done and saved

Your husband so much sweatCominius

Droop not AdieuFarewell my wife my mother

I'll do well yetThou old and true Menenius

Thy tears are salter than a younger man's

And venomous to thine eyesMy sometime general

I have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld

Heart-hard'ning spectacles Tell these sad women

'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes

As 'tis to laugh at 'emMy mother you wot well

My hazards still have been your solace and

Believe 't not lightlythough I go alone

Like to a lonely dragon that his fen

Makes feared and talked of more than seen your son

Will or exceed the common or be caught

With cautelous baits and practice

Fare you well

Thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full

Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one

That's yet unbruised Bring me but out at gate

Come my sweet wife my dearest mother and

My friends of noble touch When I am forth

Bid me farewell and smile I pray you come

While I remain above the ground you shall

Hear from me still and never of me aught

But what is like me formerly

Give me thy hand

Come

A goodly city is this Antium City

'Tis I that made thy widows Many an heir

Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars

Have I heard groan and drop Then know me not

Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones

In puny battle slay me    Save you sir

Direct me if it be your will

Where great Aufidius lies Is he in Antium

Which is his house beseech you

Thank you sir Farewell

O world thy slippery turns Friends now fast sworn

Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart

Whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise

Are still together who twin as 'twere in love

Unseparable shall within this hour

On a dissension of a doit break out

To bitterest enmity so fellest foes

Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep

To take the one the other by some chance

Some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends

And interjoin their issues So with me

My birthplace hate I and my love's upon

This enemy town I'll enter If he slay me

He does fair justice if he give me way

I'll do his country service

A goodly house The feast smells well but I

Appear not like a guest

I have deserved no better entertainment

In being Coriolanus

Away

Now th' art troublesome

Let me but stand I will not hurt your

hearth

A gentleman

True so I am

Follow your function go and batten on

cold bits

Under the canopy

Ay

I' th' city of kites and crows

No I serve not thy master

Ay 'tis an honester service than to meddle

with thy mistress Thou prat'st and prat'st Serve

with thy trencher Hence

If Tullus

Not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not

Think me for the man I am necessity

Commands me name myself

A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears

And harsh in sound to thine

Prepare thy brow to frown Know'st thou me yet

My name is Caius Martius who hath done

To thee particularly and to all the Volsces

Great hurt and mischief thereto witness may

My surname Coriolanus The painful service

The extreme dangers and the drops of blood

Shed for my thankless country are requited

But with that surname a good memory

And witness of the malice and displeasure

Which thou shouldst bear me Only that name remains

The cruelty and envy of the people

Permitted by our dastard nobles who

Have all forsook me hath devoured the rest

And suffered me by th' voice of slaves to be

Whooped out of Rome Now this extremity

Hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope

Mistake me notto save my life for if

I had feared death of all the men i' th' world

I would have 'voided thee but in mere spite

To be full quit of those my banishers

Stand I before thee here Then if thou hast

A heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge

Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims

Of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight

And make my misery serve thy turn So use it

That my revengeful services may prove

As benefits to thee for I will fight

Against my cankered country with the spleen

Of all the under fiends But if so be

Thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes

Thou 'rt tired then in a word I also am

Longer to live most weary and present

My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice

Which not to cut would show thee but a fool

Since I have ever followed thee with hate

Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast

And cannot live but to thy shame unless

It be to do thee service

You bless me gods

What's the matter

Away

Wife mother child I know not My affairs

Are servanted to others Though I owe

My revenge properly my remission lies

In Volscian breasts That we have been familiar

Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather

Than pity note how much Therefore begone

Mine ears against your suits are stronger than

Your gates against my force Yet for I loved thee

Take this along I writ it for thy sake

And would have sent it Another word Menenius

I will not hear thee speakThis man Aufidius

Was my beloved in Rome yet thou behold'st

We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow

Set down our host My partner in this action

You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly

I have borne this business

This last old man

Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to Rome

Loved me above the measure of a father

Nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge

Was to send him for whose old love I have

Though I showed sourly to himonce more offered

The first conditions which they did refuse

And cannot now accept to grace him only

That thought he could do more A very little

I have yielded to Fresh embassies and suits

Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter

Will I lend ear to Ha What shout is this

Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow

In the same time 'tis made I will not

My wife comes foremost then the honored mold

Wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand

The grandchild to her blood But out affection

All bond and privilege of nature break

Let it be virtuous to be obstinate

What is that curtsy worth Or those doves' eyes

Which can make gods forsworn I melt and am not

Of stronger earth than others My mother bows

As if Olympus to a molehill should

In supplication nod and my young boy

Hath an aspect of intercession which

Great Nature cries Deny not Let the Volsces

Plow Rome and harrow Italy I'll never

Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand

As if a man were author of himself

And knew no other kin

These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome

Like a dull actor now

I have forgot my part and I am out

Even to a full disgrace Best of my flesh

Forgive my tyranny but do not say

For that Forgive our Romans O a kiss

Long as my exile sweet as my revenge

Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss

I carried from thee dear and my true lip

Hath virgined it e'er since You gods I prate

And the most noble mother of the world

Leave unsaluted Sink my knee i' th' earth

Of thy deep duty more impression show

Than that of common sons

What's this

Your knees to me To your corrected son

Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach

Fillip the stars Then let the mutinous winds

Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun

Murdering impossibility to make

What cannot be slight work

The noble sister of Publicola

The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle

That's curdied by the frost from purest snow

And hangs on Dian's templeDear Valeria

The god of soldiers

With the consent of supreme Jove inform

Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove

To shame unvulnerable and stick i' th' wars

Like a great seamark standing every flaw

And saving those that eye thee

That's my brave boy

I beseech you peace

Or if you'd ask remember this before

The thing I have forsworn to grant may never

Be held by you denials Do not bid me

Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate

Again with Rome's mechanics Tell me not

Wherein I seem unnatural desire not

T' allay my rages and revenges with

Your colder reasons

Aufidius and you Volsces mark for we'll

Hear naught from Rome in private Your request

Not of a woman's tenderness to be

Requires nor child nor woman's face to see

I have sat too long

O mother mother

What have you done Behold the heavens do ope

The gods look down and this unnatural scene

They laugh at O my mother mother O

You have won a happy victory to Rome

But for your sonbelieve it O believe it

Most dangerously you have with him prevailed

If not most mortal to him But let it come

Aufidius though I cannot make true wars

I'll frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius

Were you in my stead would you have heard

A mother less Or granted less Aufidius

I dare be sworn you were

And sir it is no little thing to make

Mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir

What peace you'll make advise me For my part

I'll not to Rome I'll back with you and pray you

Stand to me in this causeO motherWife

Ay by and by

But we will drink together and you shall bear

A better witness back than words which we

On like conditions will have countersealed

Come enter with us Ladies you deserve

To have a temple built you All the swords

In Italy and her confederate arms

Could not have made this peace

Hail lords I am returned your soldier

No more infected with my country's love

Than when I parted hence but still subsisting

Under your great command You are to know

That prosperously I have attempted and

With bloody passage led your wars even to

The gates of Rome Our spoils we have brought home

Doth more than counterpoise a full third part

The charges of the action We have made peace

With no less honor to the Antiates

Than shame to th' Romans and we here deliver

Subscribed by' th' Consuls and patricians

Together with the seal o' th' Senate what

We have compounded on

Traitor How now

Martius

Hear'st thou Mars

Ha

Measureless liar thou hast made my heart

Too great for what contains it Boy O slave

Pardon me lords 'tis the first time that ever

I was forced to scold Your judgments my grave lords

Must give this cur the lie and his own notion

Who wears my stripes impressed upon him that

Must bear my beating to his graveshall join

To thrust the lie unto him

Cut me to pieces Volsces Men and lads

Stain all your edges on me Boy False hound

If you have writ your annals true 'tis there

That like an eagle in a dovecote I

Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles

Alone I did it Boy

O that I had him

With six Aufidiuses or more his tribe

To use my lawful sword
