


Your mind is tossing on the ocean

There where your argosies with portly sail

Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood

Or as it were the pageants of the sea

Do overpeer the petty traffickers

That curtsy to them do them reverence

As they fly by them with their woven wings

My wind cooling my broth

Would blow me to an ague when I thought

What harm a wind too great might do at sea

I should not see the sandy hourglass run

But I should think of shallows and of flats

And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand

Vailing her high top lower than her ribs

To kiss her burial Should I go to church

And see the holy edifice of stone

And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks

Which touching but my gentle vessel's side

Would scatter all her spices on the stream

Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks

And in a word but even now worth this

And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought

To think on this and shall I lack the thought

That such a thing bechanced would make me sad

But tell not me I know Antonio

Is sad to think upon his merchandise

I would have stayed till I had made you merry

If worthier friends had not prevented me

Good morrow my good lords

We'll make our leisures to attend on yours

We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers

Ay marry I'll be gone about it straight

'Tis good we do so

His hour is almost past

O ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly

To seal love's bonds new-made than they are wont

To keep obligd faith unforfeited

Here comes Lorenzo More of this hereafter

Why man I saw Bassanio under sail

With him is Gratiano gone along

And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not

He came too late the ship was under sail

But there the Duke was given to understand

That in a gondola were seen together

Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica

Besides Antonio certified the Duke

They were not with Bassanio in his ship

Why all the boys in Venice follow him

Crying His stones his daughter and his ducats

Marry well remembered

I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday

Who told me in the Narrow Seas that part

The French and English there miscarrid

A vessel of our country richly fraught

I thought upon Antonio when he told me

And wished in silence that it were not his

A kinder gentleman treads not the Earth

I saw Bassanio and Antonio part

Bassanio told him he would make some speed

Of his return He answered Do not so

Slubber not business for my sake Bassanio

But stay the very riping of the time

And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me

Let it not enter in your mind of love

Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts

To courtship and such fair ostents of love

As shall conveniently become you there

And even there his eye being big with tears

Turning his face he put his hand behind him

And with affection wondrous sensible

He wrung Bassanio's handand so they parted

Do we so

Why yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio

hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the

Narrow Seasthe Goodwins I think they call the

placea very dangerous flat and fatal where the

carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say

if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her

word

Come the full stop

I would it might prove the end of his losses

That's certain I for my part knew the tailor

that made the wings she flew withal

That's certain if the devil may be her judge

There is more difference between thy flesh

and hers than between jet and ivory more between

your bloods than there is between red wine and

Rhenish But tell us do you hear whether Antonio

have had any loss at sea or no

Why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not

take his flesh What's that good for

We have been up and down to seek him
