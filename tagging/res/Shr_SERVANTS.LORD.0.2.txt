


Will 't please your Honor taste of these conserves

O this is it that makes your servants droop

Dost thou love pictures We will fetch thee straight

Adonis painted by a running brook

And Cytherea all in sedges hid

Which seem to move and wanton with her breath

Even as the waving sedges play with wind

Will 't please your Mightiness to wash your hands

O how we joy to see your wit restored

O that once more you knew but what you are

These fifteen years you have been in a dream

Or when you waked so waked as if you slept

Amen
