
Hail, heaven!

Out of your proof you speak. We poor unfledged

Have never winged from view o’ th’ nest, nor know not

What air ’s from home. Haply this life is best

If quiet life be best, sweeter to you

That have a sharper known, well corresponding

With your stiff age; but unto us it is

A cell of ignorance, traveling abed,

A prison for a debtor that not dares

To stride a limit.

Uncertain favor!

I am throughly weary.

There is cold meat i’ th’ cave. We’ll browse on that

Whilst what we have killed be cooked.

What’s the matter, sir?

Money, youth?

Were you a woman, youth,

I should woo hard but be your groom in honesty,

Ay, bid for you as I do buy.

Would I could free ’t!

Pray, draw near.

Go you to hunting. I’ll abide with him.

 I love thee—I have spoke it—

How much the quantity, the weight as much

As I do love my father.

 I could not stir him.

He said he was gentle but unfortunate,

Dishonestly afflicted but yet honest.

But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters

And sauced our broths as Juno had been sick

And he her dieter.

I do note

That grief and patience, rooted in them both,

Mingle their spurs together.

He is but one. You and my brother search

What companies are near. Pray you, away.

Let me alone with him.

A thing

More slavish did I ne’er than answering

A slave without a knock.

To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I

An arm as big as thine? A heart as big?

Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not

My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,

Why I should yield to thee.

No, nor thy tailor, rascal.

Who is thy grandfather? He made those clothes,

Which, as it seems, make thee.

Hence then, and thank

The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool.

I am loath to beat thee.

What’s thy name?

Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,

I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,

’Twould move me sooner.

I am sorry for ’t, not seeming

So worthy as thy birth.

Those that I reverence, those I fear—the wise;

At fools I laugh, not fear them.

This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;

There was no money in ’t. Not Hercules

Could have knocked out his brains, for he had none.

Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne

My head as I do his.

I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten’s head,

Son to the Queen, after his own report,

Who called me traitor mountaineer, and swore

With his own single hand he’d take us in,

Displace our heads where, thank the gods, they grow,

And set them on Lud’s Town.

Why, worthy father, what have we to lose

But that he swore to take, our lives? The law

Protects not us. Then why should we be tender

To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,

Play judge and executioner all himself,

For we do fear the law? What company

Discover you abroad?

With his own sword,

Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en

His head from him. I’ll throw ’t into the creek

Behind our rock, and let it to the sea

And tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten.

That’s all I reck.

Where’s my brother?

I have sent Cloten’s clotpole down the stream

In embassy to his mother. His body’s hostage

For his return.

Is he at home?

What does he mean? Since death of my dear’st mother

It did not speak before. All solemn things

Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?

Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys

Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.

Is Cadwal mad?

O sweetest, fairest lily!

My brother wears thee not the one half so well

As when thou grew’st thyself.

Where?

Why, he but sleeps.

If he be gone, he’ll make his grave a bed;

With female fairies will his tomb be haunted—

And worms will not come to thee.

Prithee, have done,

And do not play in wench-like words with that

Which is so serious. Let us bury him

And not protract with admiration what

Is now due debt. To th’ grave.

By good Euriphile, our mother.

Cadwal,

I cannot sing. I’ll weep, and word it with thee,

For notes of sorrow, out of tune, are worse

Than priests and fanes that lie.

Pray you fetch him hither.

Thersites’ body is as good as Ajax’

When neither are alive.

Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th’ east;

My father hath a reason for ’t.

Come on then, and remove him.

Fear no more the heat o’ th’ sun,

Nor the furious winter’s rages;

Thou thy worldly task hast done,

Home art gone and ta’en thy wages.

Golden lads and girls all must,

As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the lightning flash.

Fear not slander, censure rash;

All lovers young, all lovers must

Consign to thee and come to dust.

No exorciser harm thee,

Ghost unlaid forbear thee.

Quiet consummation have,

And renownèd be thy grave.

We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.

The noise is round about us.

Nay, what hope

Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans

Must or for Britons slay us or receive us

For barbarous and unnatural revolts

During their use, and slay us after.

This is, sir, a doubt

In such a time nothing becoming you

Nor satisfying us.

Than be so

Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th’ army.

I and my brother are not known; yourself

So out of thought, and thereto so o’ergrown,

Cannot be questioned.

By heavens, I’ll go!

If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,

I’ll take the better care, but if you will not,

The hazard therefore due fall on me by

The hands of Romans.

Stand, stand, and fight!

The same dead thing alive.

But we see him dead.

This is sure Fidele.

Let me end the story.

I slew him there.

I have spoke it, and I did it.

A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me

Were nothing princelike, for he did provoke me

With language that would make me spurn the sea

If it could so roar to me. I cut off ’s head,

And am right glad he is not standing here

To tell this tale of mine.

And our good his.

And at first meeting loved,

Continued so until we thought he died.
