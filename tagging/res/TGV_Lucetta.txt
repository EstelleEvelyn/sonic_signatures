


Ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully

Please you repeat their names I'll show my mind

According to my shallow simple skill

As of a knight well-spoken neat and fine

But were I you he never should be mine

Well of his wealth but of himself so-so

Lord Lord to see what folly reigns in us

Pardon dear madam 'tis a passing shame

That I unworthy body as I am

Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen

Then thus of many good I think him best

I have no other but a woman's reason

I think him so because I think him so

Ay if you thought your love not cast away

Yet he of all the rest I think best loves you

Fire that's closest kept burns most of all

O they love least that let men know their love

Peruse this paper madam

That the contents will show

Sir Valentine's page and sent I think from Proteus

He would have given it you but I being in the way

Did in your name receive it Pardon the fault I pray

To plead for love deserves more fee than hate

That you may ruminate

What would your Ladyship

I would it were

That you might kill your stomach on your meat

And not upon your maid

Nothing

To take a paper up that I let fall

Nothing concerning me

Madam it will not lie where it concerns

Unless it have a false interpreter

That I might sing it madam to a tune

Give me a note Your Ladyship can set

It is too heavy for so light a tune

Ay and melodious were it would you sing it

I cannot reach so high

Keep tune there still so you will sing it out

And yet methinks I do not like this tune

No madam 'tis too sharp

Nay now you are too flat

And mar the concord with too harsh a descant

There wanteth but a mean to fill your song

Indeed I bid the base for Proteus

She makes it strange but she would be best pleased

To be so angered with another letter

Madam dinner is ready and your father stays

What shall these papers lie like telltales here

Nay I was taken up for laying them down

Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold

Ay madam you may say what sights you see

I see things too although you judge I wink

Alas the way is wearisome and long

Better forbear till Proteus make return

I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire

But qualify the fire's extreme rage

Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason

But in what habit will you go along

Why then your Ladyship must cut your hair

What fashion madam shall I make your breeches

You must needs have them with a codpiece madam

A round hose madam now's not worth a pin

Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on

If you think so then stay at home and go not

Then never dream on infamy but go

If Proteus like your journey when you come

No matter who's displeased when you are gone

I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal

All these are servants to deceitful men

Pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him
