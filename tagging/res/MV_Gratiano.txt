


You look not well Signior Antonio

You have too much respect upon the world

They lose it that do buy it with much care

Believe me you are marvelously changed

Let me play the fool

With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come

And let my liver rather heat with wine

Than my heart cool with mortifying groans

Why should a man whose blood is warm within

Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster

Sleep when he wakes And creep into the jaundice

By being peevish I tell thee what Antonio

I love thee and 'tis my love that speaks

There are a sort of men whose visages

Do cream and mantle like a standing pond

And do a willful stillness entertain

With purpose to be dressed in an opinion

Of wisdom gravity profound conceit

As who should say I am Sir Oracle

And when I ope my lips let no dog bark

O my Antonio I do know of these

That therefore only are reputed wise

For saying nothing when I am very sure

If they should speak would almost damn those ears

Which hearing them would call their brothers fools

I'll tell thee more of this another time

But fish not with this melancholy bait

For this fool gudgeon this opinion

Come good LorenzoFare you well a while

I'll end my exhortation after dinner

Well keep me company but two years more

Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue

Thanks i' faith for silence is only commendable

In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible

Where's your master

Signior Bassanio

I have suit to you

You must not deny me I must go with you

to Belmont

Signior Bassanio hear me

If I do not put on a sober habit

Talk with respect and swear but now and then

Wear prayer books in my pocket look demurely

Nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes

Thus with my hat and sigh and say amen

Use all the observance of civility

Like one well studied in a sad ostent

To please his grandam never trust me more

Nay but I bar tonight You shall not gauge me

By what we do tonight

And I must to Lorenzo and the rest

But we will visit you at supper time

We have not made good preparation

Love news in faith

Was not that letter from fair Jessica

This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo

Desired us to make stand

And it is marvel he outdwells his hour

For lovers ever run before the clock

That ever holds Who riseth from a feast

With that keen appetite that he sits down

Where is the horse that doth untread again

His tedious measures with the unbated fire

That he did pace them first All things that are

Are with more spirit chasd than enjoyed

How like a younger or a prodigal

The scarfd bark puts from her native bay

Hugged and embracd by the strumpet wind

How like the prodigal doth she return

With overweathered ribs and raggd sails

Lean rent and beggared by the strumpet wind

Now by my hood a gentle and no Jew

Signior Antonio

I am glad on 't I desire no more delight

Than to be under sail and gone tonight

My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady

I wish you all the joy that you can wish

For I am sure you can wish none from me

And when your honors mean to solemnize

The bargain of your faith I do beseech you

Even at that time I may be married too

I thank your Lordship you have got me one

My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours

You saw the mistress I beheld the maid

You loved I loved for intermission

No more pertains to me my lord than you

Your fortune stood upon the caskets there

And so did mine too as the matter falls

For wooing here until I sweat again

And swearing till my very roof was dry

With oaths of love at last if promise last

I got a promise of this fair one here

To have her love provided that your fortune

Achieved her mistress

Yes faith my lord

We'll play with them the first boy for a

thousand ducats

No we shall ne'er win at that sport and

stake down

But who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel

What and my old Venetian friend Salerio

Nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome

Your hand Salerio What's the news from Venice

How doth that royal merchant good Antonio

I know he will be glad of our success

We are the Jasons we have won the Fleece

Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew

Thou mak'st thy knife keen But no metal can

No not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness

Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee

O be thou damned inexecrable dog

And for thy life let justice be accused

Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith

To hold opinion with Pythagoras

That souls of animals infuse themselves

Into the trunks of men Thy currish spirit

Governed a wolf who hanged for human slaughter

Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet

And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam

Infused itself in thee for thy desires

Are wolfish bloody starved and ravenous

I have a wife who I protest I love

I would she were in heaven so she could

Entreat some power to change this currish Jew

O upright judgeMark JewO learnd judge

O learnd judgeMark Jew a learnd judge

O Jew an upright judge a learnd judge

A second Daniel A Daniel Jew

Now infidel I have you on the hip

A Daniel still say I A second Daniel

I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word

Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself

And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state

Thou hast not left the value of a cord

Therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge

A halter gratis nothing else for God's sake

In christ'ning shalt thou have two godfathers

Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more

To bring thee to the gallows not to the font

Fair sir you are well o'erta'en

My Lord Bassanio upon more advice

Hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat

Your company at dinner

That will I do

By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong

In faith I gave it to the judge's clerk

Would he were gelt that had it for my part

Since you do take it love so much at heart

About a hoop of gold a paltry ring

That she did give me whose posy was

For all the world like cutler's poetry

Upon a knife Love me and leave me not

He will an if he live to be a man

Now by this hand I gave it to a youth

A kind of boy a little scrubbd boy

No higher than thyself the judge's clerk

A prating boy that begged it as a fee

I could not for my heart deny it him

My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away

Unto the judge that begged it and indeed

Deserved it too And then the boy his clerk

That took some pains in writing he begged mine

And neither man nor master would take aught

But the two rings

Well do you so Let not me take him then

For if I do I'll mar the young clerk's pen

Why this is like the mending of highways

In summer where the ways are fair enough

What are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it

Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold

Let it be so The first inter'gatory

That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is

Whether till the next night she had rather stay

Or go to bed now being two hours to day

But were the day come I should wish it dark

Till I were couching with the doctor's clerk

Well while I live I'll fear no other thing

So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring
