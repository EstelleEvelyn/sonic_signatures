


Your Grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves

You are so noble To your Highness' hand

I tender my commissionby whose virtue

The court of Rome commanding you my Lord

Cardinal of York are joined with me their servant

In the unpartial judging of this business

My lord of York was not one Doctor Pace

In this man's place before him

Was he not held a learnd man

Believe me there's an ill opinion spread then

Even of yourself Lord Cardinal

They will not stick to say you envied him

And fearing he would risehe was so virtuous

Kept him a foreign man still which so grieved him

That he ran mad and died

His Grace

Hath spoken well and justly Therefore madam

It's fit this royal session do proceed

And that without delay their arguments

Be now produced and heard

The Queen is obstinate

Stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and

Disdainful to be tried by 't 'Tis not well

She's going away

So please your Highness

The Queen being absent 'tis a needful fitness

That we adjourn this court till further day

Meanwhile must be an earnest motion

Made to the Queen to call back her appeal

She intends unto his Holiness

Most honored madam

My Lord of York out of his noble nature

Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace

Forgetting like a good man your late censure

Both of his truth and himwhich was too far

Offers as I do in a sign of peace

His service and his counsel

I would your Grace

Would leave your griefs and take my counsel

Put your main cause into the King's protection

He's loving and most gracious 'Twill be much

Both for your honor better and your cause

For if the trial of the law o'ertake you

You'll part away disgraced

Your rage mistakes us

Your fears are worse

Madam you'll find it so You wrong your virtues

With these weak women's fears A noble spirit

As yours was put into you ever casts

Such doubts as false coin from it The King loves you

Beware you lose it not For us if you please

To trust us in your business we are ready

To use our utmost studies in your service
