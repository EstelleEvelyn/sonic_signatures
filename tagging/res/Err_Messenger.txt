My master and his man are both broke loose

Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor

Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire

And ever as it blazed they threw on him

Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair

My master preaches patience to him and the while

His man with scissors nicks him like a fool

And sure unless you send some present help

Between them they will kill the conjurer

Mistress upon my life I tell you true

I have not breathed almost since I did see it

He cries for you and vows if he can take you

To scorch your face and to disfigure you

Hark hark I hear him mistress Fly begone
