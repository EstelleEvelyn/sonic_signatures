Have steeped their galls in honey, and do serve you

With hearts create of duty and of zeal.

Sir, you show great mercy if you give him life

After the taste of much correction.

And I, my royal sovereign.

To which we all appeal.

Never did faithful subject more rejoice

At the discovery of most dangerous treason

Than I do at this hour joy o’er myself,

Prevented from a damnèd enterprise.

My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
