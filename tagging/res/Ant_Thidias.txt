
Caesar, I go.

Caesar, I shall.

Hear it apart.

So haply are they friends to Antony.

So.—

Thus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats

Not to consider in what case thou stand’st

Further than he is Caesar.

He knows that you embrace not Antony

As you did love, but as you feared him.

The scars upon your honor therefore he

Does pity as constrainèd blemishes,

Not as deserved.

Shall I say to Caesar

What you require of him? For he partly begs

To be desired to give. It much would please him

That of his fortunes you should make a staff

To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits

To hear from me you had left Antony

And put yourself under his shroud,

The universal landlord.

My name is Thidias.

’Tis your noblest course.

Wisdom and fortune combating together,

If that the former dare but what it can,

No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay

My duty on your hand.

One that but performs

The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest

To have command obeyed.

Mark Antony—
