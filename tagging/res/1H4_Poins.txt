Remorse What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar

Jack how agrees the devil and thee about

thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last

for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg

Then art thou damned for keeping

thy word with the devil

But my lads my lads tomorrow morning by

four o'clock early at Gad's Hill there are pilgrims

going to Canterbury with rich offerings and traders

riding to London with fat purses I have vizards for

you all You have horses for yourselves Gadshill lies

tonight in Rochester I have bespoke supper tomorrow

night in Eastcheap We may do it as secure as

sleep If you will go I will stuff your purses full of

crowns If you will not tarry at home and be

hanged

You will chops

Sir John I prithee leave the Prince and me

alone I will lay him down such reasons for this

adventure that he shall go

Now my good sweet honey lord ride with us

tomorrow I have a jest to execute that I cannot

manage alone Falstaff Peto Bardolph and Gadshill

shall rob those men that we have already

waylaid Yourself and I will not be there And when

they have the booty if you and I do not rob them

cut this head off from my shoulders

Why we will set forth before or after them and

appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at our

pleasure to fail and then will they adventure upon

the exploit themselves which they shall have no

sooner achieved but we'll set upon them

Tut our horses they shall not see I'll tie them

in the wood Our vizards we will change after we

leave them And sirrah I have cases of buckram

for the nonce to immask our noted outward

garments

Well for two of them I know them to be as

true-bred cowards as ever turned back and for the

third if he fight longer than he sees reason I'll

forswear arms The virtue of this jest will be the

incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will

tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least

he fought with what wards what blows what

extremities he endured and in the reproof of this

lives the jest

Farewell my lord

Come shelter shelter I have removed Falstaff's

horse and he frets like a gummed velvet

O 'tis our setter I know his voice

Sirrah Jack thy horse stands behind the hedge

When thou need'st him there thou shalt find him

Farewell and stand fast

Here hard by Stand close

Stand close I hear them coming

Villains

How the fat rogue roared

Where hast been Hal

Anon anon sir

As merry as crickets my lad But hark you

what cunning match have you made with this jest

of the drawer Come what's the issue

Welcome Jack Where hast thou been

Zounds you fat paunch an you call me coward

by the Lord I'll stab thee

Ay ay he said four

Ay four in buckram suits

Down fell their hose

Come your reason Jack your reason

Mark Jack

Come let's hear Jack What trick hast thou

now
