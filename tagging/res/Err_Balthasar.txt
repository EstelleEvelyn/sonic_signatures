I hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear

Good meat sir is common that every churl affords

Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast

In debating which was best we shall part with neither

Have patience sir O let it not be so

Herein you war against your reputation

And draw within the compass of suspect

Th' unviolated honor of your wife

Once this your long experience of her wisdom

Her sober virtue years and modesty

Plead on her part some cause to you unknown

And doubt not sir but she will well excuse

Why at this time the doors are made against you

Be ruled by me depart in patience

And let us to the Tiger all to dinner

And about evening come yourself alone

To know the reason of this strange restraint

If by strong hand you offer to break in

Now in the stirring passage of the day

A vulgar comment will be made of it

And that supposd by the common rout

Against your yet ungalld estimation

That may with foul intrusion enter in

And dwell upon your grave when you are dead

For slander lives upon succession

Forever housd where it gets possession
