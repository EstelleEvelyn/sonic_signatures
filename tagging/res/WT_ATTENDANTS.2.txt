is fulfilled: the King’s daughter is found! Such a

deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that

ballad makers cannot be able to express it.

Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward. He can

deliver you more.—How goes it now, sir? This news

which is called true is so like an old tale that the

verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King

found his heir?

No.

What, pray you, became of Antigonus,

that carried hence the child?

I thought she had some great

matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or

thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,

visited that removed house. Shall we thither and

with our company piece the rejoicing?
