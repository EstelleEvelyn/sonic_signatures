


Cease to persuade my loving Proteus

Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits

Were 't not affection chains thy tender days

To the sweet glances of thy honored love

I rather would entreat thy company

To see the wonders of the world abroad

Than living dully sluggardized at home

Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness

But since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein

Even as I would when I to love begin

And on a love-book pray for my success

That's on some shallow story of deep love

How young Leander crossed the Hellespont

'Tis true for you are over boots in love

And yet you never swam the Hellespont

No I will not for it boots thee not

To be in love where scorn is bought with groans

Coy looks with heart-sore sighs one fading moment's mirth

With twenty watchful weary tedious nights

If haply won perhaps a hapless gain

If lost why then a grievous labor won

How ever but a folly bought with wit

Or else a wit by folly vanquishd

So by your circumstance I fear you'll prove

Love is your master for he masters you

And he that is so yokd by a fool

Methinks should not be chronicled for wise

And writers say as the most forward bud

Is eaten by the canker ere it blow

Even so by love the young and tender wit

Is turned to folly blasting in the bud

Losing his verdure even in the prime

And all the fair effects of future hopes

But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee

That art a votary to fond desire

Once more adieu My father at the road

Expects my coming there to see me shipped

Sweet Proteus no Now let us take our leave

To Milan let me hear from thee by letters

Of thy success in love and what news else

Betideth here in absence of thy friend

And I likewise will visit thee with mine

As much to you at home And so farewell

Not mine My gloves are on

Ha Let me see Ay give it me it's mine

Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine

Ah Sylvia Sylvia

How now sirrah

Why sir who bade you call her

Well you'll still be too forward

Go to sir Tell me do you know Madam

Sylvia

Why how know you that I am in love

Are all these things perceived in me

Without me They cannot

But tell me dost thou know my Lady

Sylvia

Hast thou observed that Even she I mean

Dost thou know her by my gazing on her

and yet know'st her not

Not so fair boy as well-favored

What dost thou know

I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her

favor infinite

How painted And how out of count

How esteem'st thou me I account of her

beauty

How long hath she been deformed

I have loved her ever since I saw her and

still I see her beautiful

Why

What should I see then

Belike boy then you are in love for last

morning you could not see to wipe my shoes

In conclusion I stand affected to her

Last night she enjoined me to write some

lines to one she loves

I have

No boy but as well as I can do them

Peace here she comes

Madam and mistress a thousand

good-morrows

As you enjoined me I have writ your letter

Unto the secret nameless friend of yours

Which I was much unwilling to proceed in

But for my duty to your Ladyship

Now trust me madam it came hardly off

For being ignorant to whom it goes

I writ at random very doubtfully

No madam So it stead you I will write

Please you command a thousand times as much

And yet

What means your Ladyship Do you not like it

Madam they are for you

Please you I'll write your Ladyship another

If it please me madam What then

How now sir What are you reasoning

with yourself

To do what

To whom

What figure

Why she hath not writ to me

No believe me

She gave me none except an angry word

That's the letter I writ to her friend

I would it were no worse

I have dined

Mistress

Ay boy it's for love

Of my mistress then

Indeed madam I seem so

Haply I do

So do you

Wise

Your folly

I quote it in your jerkin

Well then I'll double your folly

Give him leave madam He is a kind of

chameleon

You have said sir

I know it well sir You always end ere you

begin

'Tis indeed madam We thank the giver

Yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire

Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your Ladyship's

looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your

company

I know it well sir You have an exchequer

of words and I think no other treasure to give your

followers for it appears by their bare liveries that

they live by your bare words

My lord I will be thankful

To any happy messenger from thence

Ay my good lord I know the gentleman

To be of worth and worthy estimation

And not without desert so well reputed

Ay my good lord a son that well deserves

The honor and regard of such a father

I knew him as myself for from our infancy

We have conversed and spent our hours together

And though myself have been an idle truant

Omitting the sweet benefit of time

To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection

Yet hath Sir Proteusfor that's his name

Made use and fair advantage of his days

His years but young but his experience old

His head unmellowed but his judgment ripe

And in a wordfor far behind his worth

Comes all the praises that I now bestow

He is complete in feature and in mind

With all good grace to grace a gentleman

Should I have wished a thing it had been he

This is the gentleman I told your Ladyship

Had come along with me but that his mistress

Did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks

Nay sure I think she holds them prisoners still

Why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes

To see such lovers Thurio as yourself

Upon a homely object Love can wink

Welcome dear ProteusMistress I beseech you

Confirm his welcome with some special favor

Mistress it is Sweet lady entertain him

To be my fellow-servant to your Ladyship

Leave off discourse of disability

Sweet lady entertain him for your servant

Now tell me how do all from whence you came

And how do yours

How does your lady And how thrives your love

Ay Proteus but that life is altered now

I have done penance for contemning Love

Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me

With bitter fasts with penitential groans

With nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs

For in revenge of my contempt of love

Love hath chased sleep from my enthralld eyes

And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow

O gentle Proteus Love's a mighty lord

And hath so humbled me as I confess

There is no woe to his correction

Nor to his service no such joy on Earth

Now no discourse except it be of love

Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep

Upon the very naked name of Love

Even she And is she not a heavenly saint

Call her divine

O flatter me for love delights in praises

Then speak the truth by her if not divine

Yet let her be a principality

Sovereign to all the creatures on the Earth

Sweet except not any

Except thou wilt except against my love

And I will help thee to prefer her too

She shall be dignified with this high honor

To bear my lady's train lest the base earth

Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss

And of so great a favor growing proud

Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower

And make rough winter everlastingly

Pardon me Proteus all I can is nothing

To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing

She is alone

Not for the world Why man she is mine own

And I as rich in having such a jewel

As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl

The water nectar and the rocks pure gold

Forgive me that I do not dream on thee

Because thou seest me dote upon my love

My foolish rival that her father likes

Only for his possessions are so huge

Is gone with her along and I must after

For love thou know'st is full of jealousy

Ay and we are betrothed nay more our marriage hour

With all the cunning manner of our flight

Determined of how I must climb her window

The ladder made of cords and all the means

Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness

Good Proteus go with me to my chamber

In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel

Will you make haste

Please it your Grace there is a messenger

That stays to bear my letters to my friends

And I am going to deliver them

The tenor of them doth but signify

My health and happy being at your court

I know it well my lord and sure the match

Were rich and honorable Besides the gentleman

Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities

Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter

Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him

What would your Grace have me to do in this

Win her with gifts if she respect not words

Dumb jewels often in their silent kind

More than quick words do move a woman's mind

A woman sometime scorns what best contents her

Send her another never give her o'er

For scorn at first makes after-love the more

If she do frown 'tis not in hate of you

But rather to beget more love in you

If she do chide 'tis not to have you gone

Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone

Take no repulse whatever she doth say

For get you gone she doth not mean away

Flatter and praise commend extol their graces

Though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces

That man that hath a tongue I say is no man

If with his tongue he cannot win a woman

Why then I would resort to her by night

What lets but one may enter at her window

Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords

To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks

Would serve to scale another Hero's tower

So bold Leander would adventure it

When would you use it Pray sir tell me that

By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder

It will be light my lord that you may bear it

Under a cloak that is of any length

Ay my good lord

Why any cloak will serve the turn my lord

And why not death rather than living torment

To die is to be banished from myself

And Sylvia is myself banished from her

Is self from selfa deadly banishment

What light is light if Sylvia be not seen

What joy is joy if Sylvia be not by

Unless it be to think that she is by

And feed upon the shadow of perfection

Except I be by Sylvia in the night

There is no music in the nightingale

Unless I look on Sylvia in the day

There is no day for me to look upon

She is my essence and I leave to be

If I be not by her fair influence

Fostered illumined cherished kept alive

I fly not death to fly his deadly doom

Tarry I here I but attend on death

But fly I hence I fly away from life

No

Neither

Nothing

My ears are stopped and cannot hear good news

So much of bad already hath possessed them

Is Sylvia dead

No Valentine indeed for sacred Sylvia

Hath she forsworn me

No Valentine if Sylvia have forsworn me

What is your news

O I have fed upon this woe already

And now excess of it will make me surfeit

Doth Sylvia know that I am banishd

No more unless the next word that thou speak'st

Have some malignant power upon my life

If so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear

As ending anthem of my endless dolor

I pray thee Lance an if thou seest my boy

Bid him make haste and meet me at the North Gate

O my dear Sylvia Hapless Valentine

My friends

Then know that I have little wealth to lose

A man I am crossed with adversity

My riches are these poor habiliments

Of which if you should here disfurnish me

You take the sum and substance that I have

To Verona

From Milan

Some sixteen months and longer might have stayed

If crooked fortune had not thwarted me

I was

For that which now torments me to rehearse

I killed a man whose death I much repent

But yet I slew him manfully in fight

Without false vantage or base treachery

I was and held me glad of such a doom

My youthful travel therein made me happy

Or else I often had been miserable

Peace villain

Nothing but my fortune

I take your offer and will live with you

Provided that you do no outrages

On silly women or poor passengers

How use doth breed a habit in a man

This shadowy desert unfrequented woods

I better brook than flourishing peopled towns

Here can I sit alone unseen of any

And to the nightingale's complaining notes

Tune my distresses and record my woes

O thou that dost inhabit in my breast

Leave not the mansion so long tenantless

Lest growing ruinous the building fall

And leave no memory of what it was

Repair me with thy presence Sylvia

Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain

What hallowing and what stir is this today

These are my mates that make their wills their law

Have some unhappy passenger in chase

They love me well yet I have much to do

To keep them from uncivil outrages

Withdraw thee Valentine Who's this comes here

How like a dream is this I see and hear

Love lend me patience to forbear awhile

Ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch

Thou friend of an ill fashion

Thou common friend that's without faith or love

For such is a friend now Treacherous man

Thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye

Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say

I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me

Who should be trusted when one's right hand

Is perjured to the bosom Proteus

I am sorry I must never trust thee more

But count the world a stranger for thy sake

The private wound is deepest O time most accursed

'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst

Then I am paid

And once again I do receive thee honest

Who by repentance is not satisfied

Is nor of heaven nor Earth for these are pleased

By penitence th' Eternal's wrath's appeased

And that my love may appear plain and free

All that was mine in Sylvia I give thee

Why boy

Why wag how now What's the matter Look up Speak

Come come a hand from either

Let me be blest to make this happy close

'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes

Forbear forbear I say It is my lord the Duke

Your Grace is welcome to a man disgraced

Banished Valentine

Thurio give back or else embrace thy death

Come not within the measure of my wrath

Do not name Sylvia thine if once again

Verona shall not hold thee Here she stands

Take but possession of her with a touch

I dare thee but to breathe upon my love

I thank your Grace the gift hath made me happy

I now beseech you for your daughter's sake

To grant one boon that I shall ask of you

These banished men that I have kept withal

Are men endued with worthy qualities

Forgive them what they have committed here

And let them be recalled from their exile

They are reformd civil full of good

And fit for great employment worthy lord

And as we walk along I dare be bold

With our discourse to make your Grace to smile

What think you of this page my lord

I warrant you my lord more grace than boy

Please you I'll tell you as we pass along

That you will wonder what hath fortund

Come Proteus 'tis your penance but to hear

The story of your loves discoverd

That done our day of marriage shall be yours

One feast one house one mutual happiness
