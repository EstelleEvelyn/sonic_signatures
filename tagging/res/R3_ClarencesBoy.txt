Why do you look on us and shake your head

And call us orphans wretches castaways

If that our noble father were alive

Then you conclude my grandam he is dead

The King mine uncle is to blame for it

God will revenge it whom I will importune

With earnest prayers all to that effect

Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester

Told me the King provoked to it by the Queen

Devised impeachments to imprison him

And when my uncle told me so he wept

And pitied me and kindly kissed my cheek

Bade me rely on him as on my father

And he would love me dearly as a child

Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam

I cannot think it Hark what noise is this

Ah aunt you wept not for our father's death

How can we aid you with our kindred tears

Ah for our father for our dear lord Clarence

What stay had we but Clarence And he's gone

Were never orphans had so dear a loss
