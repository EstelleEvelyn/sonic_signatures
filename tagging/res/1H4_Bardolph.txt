Stand!

We four set upon some dozen.

And bound them.

As we were sharing, some six or seven

fresh men set upon us.

Faith, I ran when I saw others run.

Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass

to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our

garments with it, and swear it was the blood of true

men. I did that I did not this seven year before: I

blushed to hear his monstrous devices.

My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you

behold these exhalations?

What think you they portend?

Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.

O my lord, my lord, the Sheriff with a most

monstrous watch is at the door.

Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live

long.

Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must

needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable

compass, Sir John.

Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.

’Sblood, I would my face were in your

belly!

Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.

Indeed, Sir John, you said so.

Do, my lord.

My lord.

Will you give me money, captain?

This bottle makes an angel.

I will, captain. Farewell.
