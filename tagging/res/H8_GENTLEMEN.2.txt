
O, God save you.

E’en to the Hall to hear what shall become

Of the great Duke of Buckingham.

Were you there?

Pray speak what has happened.

Is he found guilty?

I am sorry for ’t.

But pray, how passed it?

That was he

That fed him with his prophecies?

After all this, how did he bear himself?

I do not think he fears death.

Certainly

The Cardinal is the end of this.

That trick of state

Was a deep envious one.

All the commons

Hate him perniciously and, o’ my conscience,

Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much

They love and dote on, call him bounteous Buckingham,

The mirror of all courtesy.

Let’s stand close and behold him.

If the Duke be guiltless,

’Tis full of woe. Yet I can give you inkling

Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,

Greater than this.

This secret is so weighty ’twill require

A strong faith to conceal it.

I am confident;

You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear

A buzzing of a separation

Between the King and Katherine?

But that slander, sir,

Is found a truth now, for it grows again

Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain

The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,

Or some about him near, have, out of malice

To the good queen, possessed him with a scruple

That will undo her. To confirm this too,

Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately,

As all think, for this business.

I think you have hit the mark. But is ’t not cruel

That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal

Will have his will, and she must fall.

So are you.

’Tis all my business. At our last encounter,

The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.

’Tis well. The citizens

I am sure have shown at full their royal minds,

As, let ’em have their rights, they are ever forward

In celebration of this day with shows,

Pageants, and sights of honor.

May I be bold to ask what that contains,

That paper in your hand?

I thank you, sir. Had I not known those customs,

I should have been beholding to your paper.

But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine,

The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?

Alas, good lady!

The trumpets sound. Stand close. The Queen is coming.

A royal train, believe me! These I know.

Who’s that that bears the scepter?

A bold brave gentleman.    That should be

The Duke of Suffolk.

And that my Lord of Norfolk?

Heaven bless thee!

Thou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on.—

Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel.

Our king has all the Indies in his arms,

And more, and richer, when he strains that lady.

I cannot blame his conscience.

Those men are happy, and so are all are near her.

I take it she that carries up the train

Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.

Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed.

No more of that.

You saw

The ceremony?

Good sir, speak it to us!

But what followed?

What two reverend bishops

Were those that went on each side of the Queen?

He of Winchester

Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s,

The virtuous Cranmer.

Who may that be, I pray you?

He will deserve more.

You may command us, sir.
