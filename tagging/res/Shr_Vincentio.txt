


Fair sir and you my merry mistress

That with your strange encounter much amazed me

My name is called Vincentio my dwelling Pisa

And bound I am to Padua there to visit

A son of mine which long I have not seen

Lucentio gentle sir

But is this true or is it else your pleasure

Like pleasant travelers to break a jest

Upon the company you overtake

You shall not choose but drink before you go

I think I shall command your welcome here

And by all likelihood some cheer is toward

Is Signior Lucentio within sir

What if a man bring him a hundred pound

or two to make merry withal

Art thou his father

Come hither crack-hemp

Come hither you rogue What have you

forgot me

What you notorious villain didst thou

never see thy master's father Vincentio

Is 't so indeed

What am I sir Nay what are you sir O

immortal gods O fine villain A silken doublet a

velvet hose a scarlet cloak and a copatain hat O I

am undone I am undone While I play the good

husband at home my son and my servant spend all

at the university

Thy father O villain he is a sailmaker in

Bergamo

His name As if I knew not his name I have

brought him up ever since he was three years old

and his name is Tranio

Lucentio O he hath murdered his master

Lay hold on him I charge you in the Duke's name

O my son my son Tell me thou villain where is

my son Lucentio

Carry me to the jail

Thus strangers may be haled and abused

O monstrous villain

Lives my sweet son

Where is that damnd villain Tranio

That faced and braved me in this matter so

I'll slit the villain's nose that would have

sent me to the jail

Fear not Baptista we will content you Go

to But I will in to be revenged for this villainy

Ay mistress bride hath that awakened you

'Tis a good hearing when children are toward
