
For a worthy lady

And one who much I honor.

I may not, madam.

To the contrary I have express commandment.

So please you, madam,

To put apart these your attendants, I

Shall bring Emilia forth.

And, madam, I must be present at your conference.

Madam, if ’t please the Queen to send the babe,

I know not what I shall incur to pass it,

Having no warrant.

I do believe it.
