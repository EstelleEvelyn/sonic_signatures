The King hath note of all that they intend,

By interception which they dream not of.

The King himself is rode to view their battle.

Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.

And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,

For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.

He is as full of valor as of kindness,

Princely in both.
