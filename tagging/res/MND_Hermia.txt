


So is Lysander

I would my father looked but with my eyes

I do entreat your Grace to pardon me

I know not by what power I am made bold

Nor how it may concern my modesty

In such a presence here to plead my thoughts

But I beseech your Grace that I may know

The worst that may befall me in this case

If I refuse to wed Demetrius

So will I grow so live so die my lord

Ere I will yield my virgin patent up

Unto his Lordship whose unwishd yoke

My soul consents not to give sovereignty

Belike for want of rain which I could well

Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes

O cross Too high to be enthralled to low

O spite Too old to be engaged to young

O hell to choose love by another's eyes

If then true lovers have been ever crossed

It stands as an edict in destiny

Then let us teach our trial patience

Because it is a customary cross

As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs

Wishes and tears poor fancy's followers

My good Lysander

I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow

By his best arrow with the golden head

By the simplicity of Venus' doves

By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves

And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen

When the false Trojan under sail was seen

By all the vows that ever men have broke

In number more than ever women spoke

In that same place thou hast appointed me

Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee

Godspeed fair Helena Whither away

I frown upon him yet he loves me still

I give him curses yet he gives me love

The more I hate the more he follows me

His folly Helena is no fault of mine

Take comfort he no more shall see my face

Lysander and myself will fly this place

Before the time I did Lysander see

Seemed Athens as a paradise to me

O then what graces in my love do dwell

That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell

And in the wood where often you and I

Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie

Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet

There my Lysander and myself shall meet

And thence from Athens turn away our eyes

To seek new friends and stranger companies

Farewell sweet playfellow Pray thou for us

And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius

Keep word Lysander We must starve our sight

From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight

Be it so Lysander Find you out a bed

For I upon this bank will rest my head

Nay good Lysander For my sake my dear

Lie further off yet Do not lie so near

Lysander riddles very prettily

Now much beshrew my manners and my pride

If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied

But gentle friend for love and courtesy

Lie further off in human modesty

Such separation as may well be said

Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid

So far be distant and good night sweet friend

Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end

With half that wish the wisher's eyes be pressed

Help me Lysander help me Do thy best

To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast

Ay me for pity What a dream was here

Lysander look how I do quake with fear

Methought a serpent ate my heart away

And you sat smiling at his cruel prey

Lysander What removed Lysander lord

What out of hearing Gone No sound no word

Alack where are you Speak an if you hear

Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear

No Then I well perceive you are not nigh

Either death or you I'll find immediately

Now I but chide but I should use thee worse

For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse

If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep

Being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep

And kill me too

The sun was not so true unto the day

As he to me Would he have stolen away

From sleeping Hermia I'll believe as soon

This whole Earth may be bored and that the moon

May through the center creep and so displease

Her brother's noontide with th' Antipodes

It cannot be but thou hast murdered him

So should a murderer look so dead so grim

What's this to my Lysander Where is he

Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me

Out dog Out cur Thou driv'st me past the bounds

Of maiden's patience Hast thou slain him then

Henceforth be never numbered among men

O once tell true Tell true even for my sake

Durst thou have looked upon him being awake

And hast thou killed him sleeping O brave touch

Could not a worm an adder do so much

An adder did it for with doubler tongue

Than thine thou serpent never adder stung

I pray thee tell me then that he is well

A privilege never to see me more

And from thy hated presence part I so

See me no more whether he be dead or no

Dark night that from the eye his function takes

The ear more quick of apprehension makes

Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense

It pays the hearing double recompense

Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found

Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound

But why unkindly didst thou leave me so

What love could press Lysander from my side

You speak not as you think It cannot be

I am amazd at your words

I scorn you not It seems that you scorn me

I understand not what you mean by this

 Sweet do not scorn her so

Lysander whereto tends all this

Why are you grown so rude What change is this

Sweet love

Do you not jest

What can you do me greater harm than hate

Hate me Wherefore O me what news my love

Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander

I am as fair now as I was erewhile

Since night you loved me yet since night you left me

Why then you left meO the gods forbid

In earnest shall I say

O me You juggler you cankerblossom

You thief of love What have you come by night

And stol'n my love's heart from him

Puppet Why so Ay that way goes the game

Now I perceive that she hath made compare

Between our statures she hath urged her height

And with her personage her tall personage

Her height forsooth she hath prevailed with him

And are you grown so high in his esteem

Because I am so dwarfish and so low

How low am I thou painted maypole Speak

How low am I I am not yet so low

But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes

Lower Hark again

Why get you gone Who is 't that hinders you

What with Lysander

Little again Nothing but low and little

Why will you suffer her to flout me thus

Let me come to her

You mistress all this coil is long of you

Nay go not back

I am amazed and know not what to say

Never so weary never so in woe

Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers

I can no further crawl no further go

My legs can keep no pace with my desires

Here will I rest me till the break of day

Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray

Methinks I see these things with parted eye

When everything seems double

Yea and my father
