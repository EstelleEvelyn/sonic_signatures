My heart for anger burns I cannot brook it

He is both king and Duke of Lancaster

And that the lord of Westmorland shall maintain

Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons

Thy kinsmen and thy friends I'll have more lives

Than drops of blood were in my father's veins

Base fearful and despairing Henry

I cannot stay to hear these articles

Farewell faint-hearted and degenerate king

In whose cold blood no spark of honor bides
