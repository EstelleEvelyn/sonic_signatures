service.

You shall not need to fear me.

The Count Rossillion. Know you such a one?

Whatsome’er he is,

He’s bravely taken here. He stole from France,

As ’tis reported, for the King had married him

Against his liking. Think you it is so?

There is a gentleman that serves the Count

Reports but coarsely of her.

Monsieur Parolles.

Alas, poor lady,

’Tis a hard bondage to become the wife

Of a detesting lord.

He,

That with the plume. ’Tis a most gallant fellow.

I would he loved his wife. If he were honester,

He were much goodlier. Is ’t not a handsome gentleman?

’Tis pity he is not honest. Yond’s that same knave

That leads him to these places. Were I his lady,

I would poison that vile rascal.

That jackanapes with scarves. Why is he melancholy?

We’ll take your offer kindly.

No, my good lord, Diana.

She then was honest.

No.

My mother did but duty—such, my lord,

As you owe to your wife.

Ay, so you serve us

Till we serve you. But when you have our roses,

You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves

And mock us with our bareness.

’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,

But the plain single vow that is vowed true.

What is not holy, that we swear not by,

But take the high’st to witness. Then pray you, tell me,

If I should swear by Jove’s great attributes

I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths

When I did love you ill? This has no holding

To swear by him whom I protest to love

That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths

Are words, and poor conditions but unsealed,

At least in my opinion.

I see that men may rope ’s in such a snare

That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

Will you not, my lord?

Mine honor’s such a ring.

My chastity’s the jewel of our house,

Bequeathèd down from many ancestors,

Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world

In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom

Brings in the champion Honor on my part

Against your vain assault.

When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window.

I’ll order take my mother shall not hear.

Now will I charge you in the band of truth,

When you have conquered my yet maiden bed,

Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me.

My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them

When back again this ring shall be delivered.

And on your finger in the night I’ll put

Another ring, that what in time proceeds

May token to the future our past deeds.

Adieu till then; then, fail not. You have won

A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

For which live long to thank both heaven and me!

You may so in the end.

My mother told me just how he would woo

As if she sat in ’s heart. She says all men

Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me

When his wife’s dead. Therefore I’ll lie with him

When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,

Marry that will, I live and die a maid.

Only, in this disguise I think ’t no sin

To cozen him that would unjustly win.

Let death and honesty

Go with your impositions, I am yours

Upon your will to suffer.

I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,

Derivèd from the ancient Capilet.

My suit, as I do understand, you know

And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

If you shall marry,

You give away this hand, and that is mine;

You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine;

You give away myself, which is known mine,

For I by vow am so embodied yours

That she which marries you must marry me,

Either both or none.

Good my lord,

Ask him upon his oath if he does think

He had not my virginity.

He does me wrong, my lord. If I were so,

He might have bought me at a common price.

Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,

Whose high respect and rich validity

Did lack a parallel. Yet for all that

He gave it to a commoner o’ th’ camp,

If I be one.

I did, my lord, but loath am to produce

So bad an instrument. His name’s Parolles.

I must be patient.

You that have turned off a first so noble wife

May justly diet me. I pray you yet—

Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband—

Send for your ring. I will return it home,

And give me mine again.

Sir, much like the same upon your finger.

And this was it I gave him, being abed.

I have spoke the truth.

Ay, my lord.

Do you know he promised me marriage?

Ay, my good lord.

It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

It was not lent me neither.

I found it not.

I never gave it him.

It might be yours or hers for aught I know.

I’ll never tell you.

I’ll put in bail, my liege.

By Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.

Because he’s guilty and he is not guilty.

He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to ’t.

I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.

Great king, I am no strumpet. By my life,

I am either maid or else this old man’s wife.

Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir.

The jeweler that owes the ring is sent for,

And he shall surety me. But for this lord

Who hath abused me as he knows himself,

Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him.

He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,

And at that time he got his wife with child.

Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.

So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick.

And now behold the meaning.
