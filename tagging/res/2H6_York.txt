


Long live Queen Margaret England's happiness

For Suffolk's duke may he be suffocate

That dims the honor of this warlike isle

France should have torn and rent my very heart

Before I would have yielded to this league

I never read but England's kings have had

Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives

And our King Henry gives away his own

To match with her that brings no vantages

And so says Yorkfor he hath greatest cause

Anjou and Maine are given to the French

Paris is lost the state of Normandy

Stands on a tickle point now they are gone

Suffolk concluded on the articles

The peers agreed and Henry was well pleased

To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter

I cannot blame them all What is 't to them

'Tis thine they give away and not their own

Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage

And purchase friends and give to courtesans

Still reveling like lords till all be gone

Whileas the silly owner of the goods

Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands

And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof

While all is shared and all is borne away

Ready to starve and dare not touch his own

So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue

While his own lands are bargained for and sold

Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland

Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood

As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt

Unto the Prince's heart of Calydon

Anjou and Maine both given unto the French

Cold news for me for I had hope of France

Even as I have of fertile England's soil

A day will come when York shall claim his own

And therefore I will take the Nevilles' parts

And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey

And when I spy advantage claim the crown

For that's the golden mark I seek to hit

Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right

Nor hold the scepter in his childish fist

Nor wear the diadem upon his head

Whose churchlike humors fits not for a crown

Then York be still awhile till time do serve

Watch thou and wake when others be asleep

To pry into the secrets of the state

Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love

With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen

And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars

Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose

With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed

And in my standard bear the arms of York

To grapple with the house of Lancaster

And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown

Whose bookish rule hath pulled fair England down

If York have ill demeaned himself in France

Then let him be denied the regentship

I'll tell thee Suffolk why I am unmeet

First for I cannot flatter thee in pride

Next if I be appointed for the place

My lord of Somerset will keep me here

Without discharge money or furniture

Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands

Last time I danced attendance on his will

Till Paris was besieged famished and lost

Doth anyone accuse York for a traitor

Base dunghill villain and mechanical

I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech

I do beseech your royal Majesty

Let him have all the rigor of the law

Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash

Beldam I think we watched you at an inch

What madam are you there The King and commonweal

Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains

My Lord Protector will I doubt it not

See you well guerdoned for these good deserts

Lord Buckingham methinks you watched her well

A pretty plot well chosen to build upon

Now pray my lord let's see the devil's writ

What have we here

The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose

But him outlive and die a violent death

Why this is just Aio te Aeacida

Romanos vincere posse Well to the rest

Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk

By water shall he die and take his end

What shall betide the Duke of Somerset

Let him shun castles

Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains

Than where castles mounted stand

Come come my lord these oracles

Are hardly attained and hardly understood

The King is now in progress towards Saint Albans

With him the husband of this lovely lady

Thither goes these news as fast as horse can carry them

A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector

At your pleasure my good lord

Who's within there ho

Invite my lords of Salisbury and Warwick

To sup with me tomorrow night Away

Now my good lords of Salisbury and Warwick

Our simple supper ended give me leave

In this close walk to satisfy myself

In craving your opinion of my title

Which is infallible to England's crown

Then thus

Edward the Third my lords had seven sons

The first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales

The second William of Hatfield and the third

Lionel Duke of Clarence next to whom

Was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster

The fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York

The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester

William of Windsor was the seventh and last

Edward the Black Prince died before his father

And left behind him Richard his only son

Who after Edward the Third's death reigned as king

Till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster

The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt

Crowned by the name of Henry the Fourth

Seized on the realm deposed the rightful king

Sent his poor queen to France from whence she came

And him to Pomfret where as all you know

Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously

Which now they hold by force and not by right

For Richard the first son's heir being dead

The issue of the next son should have reigned

The third son Duke of Clarence from whose line

I claim the crown had issue Philippa a daughter

Who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March

Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March

Roger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor

His eldest sister Anne

My mother being heir unto the crown

Married Richard Earl of Cambridge who was son

To Edmund Langley Edward the Third's fifth son

By her I claim the kingdom She was heir

To Roger Earl of March who was the son

Of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippa

Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence

So if the issue of the elder son

Succeed before the younger I am king

We thank you lords But I am not your king

Till I be crowned and that my sword be stained

With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster

And that's not suddenly to be performed

But with advice and silent secrecy

Do you as I do in these dangerous days

Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence

At Beaufort's pride at Somerset's ambition

At Buckingham and all the crew of them

Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock

That virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey

'Tis that they seek and they in seeking that

Shall find their deaths if York can prophesy

And Neville this I do assure myself

Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick

The greatest man in England but the King

Lords let him goPlease it your Majesty

This is the day appointed for the combat

And ready are the appellant and defendant

The armorer and his manto enter the lists

So please your Highness to behold the fight

I never saw a fellow worse bestead

Or more afraid to fight than is the appellant

The servant of this armorer my lords

Dispatch This knave's tongue begins to double

Sound trumpets Alarum to the combatants

Take away his weaponFellow thank God and

the good wine in thy master's way

And did he not in his protectorship

Levy great sums of money through the realm

For soldiers' pay in France and never sent it

By means whereof the towns each day revolted

Cold news for me for I had hope of France

As firmly as I hope for fertile England

Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud

And caterpillars eat my leaves away

But I will remedy this gear ere long

Or sell my title for a glorious grave

'Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France

And being Protector stayed the soldiers' pay

By means whereof his Highness hath lost France

In your protectorship you did devise

Strange tortures for offenders never heard of

That England was defamed by tyranny

So that by this you would not have him die

'Tis York that hath more reason for his death

But my Lord Cardinal and you my lord of Suffolk

Say as you think and speak it from your souls

Were 't not all one an empty eagle were set

To guard the chicken from a hungry kite

As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector

And I And now we three have spoke it

It skills not greatly who impugns our doom

That Somerset be sent as regent thither

'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employed

Witness the fortune he hath had in France

No not to lose it all as thou hast done

I rather would have lost my life betimes

Than bring a burden of dishonor home

By staying there so long till all were lost

Show me one scar charactered on thy skin

Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win

What worse than naught Nay then a shame take all

I will my lord so please his Majesty

I am content Provide me soldiers lords

Whiles I take order for mine own affairs

My lord of Suffolk within fourteen days

At Bristow I expect my soldiers

For there I'll ship them all for Ireland

Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts

And change misdoubt to resolution

Be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art

Resign to death it is not worth th' enjoying

Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man

And find no harbor in a royal heart

Faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought

And not a thought but thinks on dignity

My brain more busy than the laboring spider

Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies

Well nobles well 'tis politicly done

To send me packing with an host of men

I fear me you but warm the starvd snake

Who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts

'Twas men I lacked and you will give them me

I take it kindly Yet be well assured

You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands

Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band

I will stir up in England some black storm

Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell

And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage

Until the golden circuit on my head

Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams

Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw

And for a minister of my intent

I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman

John Cade of Ashford

To make commotion as full well he can

Under the title of John Mortimer

In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade

Oppose himself against a troop of kerns

And fought so long till that his thighs with darts

Were almost like a sharp-quilled porpentine

And in the end being rescued I have seen

Him caper upright like a wild Morisco

Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells

Full often like a shag-haired crafty kern

Hath he conversd with the enemy

And undiscovered come to me again

And given me notice of their villainies

This devil here shall be my substitute

For that John Mortimer which now is dead

In face in gait in speech he doth resemble

By this I shall perceive the Commons' mind

How they affect the house and claim of York

Say he be taken racked and torturd

I know no pain they can inflict upon him

Will make him say I moved him to those arms

Say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will

Why then from Ireland come I with my strength

And reap the harvest which that rascal sowed

For Humphrey being dead as he shall be

And Henry put apart the next for me

From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right

And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head

Ring bells aloud Burn bonfires clear and bright

To entertain great England's lawful king

Ah sancta maiestas who would not buy thee dear

Let them obey that knows not how to rule

This hand was made to handle naught but gold

I cannot give due action to my words

Except a sword or scepter balance it

A scepter shall it have have I a soul

On which I'll toss the fleur-de-luce of France

Whom have we here Buckingham to disturb me

The King hath sent him sure I must dissemble

Humphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting

Art thou a messenger or come of pleasure

Scarce can I speak my choler is so great

O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint

I am so angry at these abject terms

And now like Ajax Telamonius

On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury

I am far better born than is the King

More like a king more kingly in my thoughts

But I must make fair weather yet awhile

Till Henry be more weak and I more strong

Buckingham I prithee pardon me

That I have given no answer all this while

My mind was troubled with deep melancholy

The cause why I have brought this army hither

Is to remove proud Somerset from the King

Seditious to his Grace and to the state

Upon thine honor is he prisoner

Then Buckingham I do dismiss my powers

Soldiers I thank you all Disperse yourselves

Meet me tomorrow in Saint George's field

You shall have pay and everything you wish

And let my sovereign virtuous Henry

Command my eldest son nay all my sons

As pledges of my fealty and love

I'll send them all as willing as I live

Lands goods horse armor anything I have

Is his to use so Somerset may die

In all submission and humility

York doth present himself unto your Highness

To heave the traitor Somerset from hence

And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade

Who since I heard to be discomfited

How now Is Somerset at liberty

Then York unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts

And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart

Shall I endure the sight of Somerset

False king why hast thou broken faith with me

Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse

King did I call thee No thou art not king

Not fit to govern and rule multitudes

Which dar'st notno nor canst notrule a traitor

That head of thine doth not become a crown

Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff

And not to grace an awful princely scepter

That gold must round engirt these brows of mine

Whose smile and frown like to Achilles' spear

Is able with the change to kill and cure

Here is a hand to hold a scepter up

And with the same to act controlling laws

Give place By heaven thou shalt rule no more

O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler

Wouldst have me kneel First let me ask of these

If they can brook I bow a knee to man

Sirrah call in my sons to be my bail

I know ere they will have me go to ward

They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement

O blood-bespotted Neapolitan

Outcast of Naples England's bloody scourge

The sons of York thy betters in their birth

Shall be their father's bail and bane to those

That for my surety will refuse the boys

See where they come I'll warrant they'll make it good

I thank thee Clifford Say what news with thee

Nay do not fright us with an angry look

We are thy sovereign Clifford kneel again

For thy mistaking so we pardon thee

Will you not sons

Look in a glass and call thy image so

I am thy king and thou a false-heart traitor

Call hither to the stake my two brave bears

That with the very shaking of their chains

They may astonish these fell-lurking curs

Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me

Nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon

Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast

I am resolved for death or dignity

The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed

But match to match I have encountered him

And made a prey for carrion kites and crows

Even of the bonny beast he loved so well

Hold Warwick Seek thee out some other chase

For I myself must hunt this deer to death

With thy brave bearing should I be in love

But that thou art so fast mine enemy

So let it help me now against thy sword

As I in justice and true right express it

A dreadful lay Address thee instantly

Thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still

Peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will

Of Salisbury who can report of him

That winter lion who in rage forgets

Agd contusions and all brush of time

And like a gallant in the brow of youth

Repairs him with occasion This happy day

Is not itself nor have we won one foot

If Salisbury be lost

I know our safety is to follow them

For as I hear the King is fled to London

To call a present court of Parliament

Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth

What says Lord Warwick Shall we after them
