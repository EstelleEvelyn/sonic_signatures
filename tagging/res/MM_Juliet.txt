


I do and bear the shame most patiently

I'll gladly learn

Yes as I love the woman that wronged him

Mutually

I do confess it and repent it father

I do repent me as it is an evil

And take the shame with joy

Must die tomorrow O injurious love

That respites me a life whose very comfort

Is still a dying horror
