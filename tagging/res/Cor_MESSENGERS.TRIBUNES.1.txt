


The nobles in great earnestness are going

All to the Senate House Some news is coming

That turns their countenances

Yes worthy sir

The slave's report is seconded and more

More fearful is delivered

It is spoke freely out of many mouths

How probable I do not knowthat Martius

Joined with Aufidius leads a power 'gainst Rome

And vows revenge as spacious as between

The young'st and oldest thing

Sir if you'd save your life fly to your house

The plebeians have got your fellow tribune

And hale him up and down all swearing if

The Roman ladies bring not comfort home

They'll give him death by inches
