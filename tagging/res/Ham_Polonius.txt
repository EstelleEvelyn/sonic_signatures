


Hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave

By laborsome petition and at last

Upon his will I sealed my hard consent

I do beseech you give him leave to go

Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame

The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail

And you are stayed for There my blessing with thee

And these few precepts in thy memory

Look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue

Nor any unproportioned thought his act

Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar

Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried

Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel

But do not dull thy palm with entertainment

Of each new-hatched unfledged courage Beware

Of entrance to a quarrel but being in

Bear 't that th' opposd may beware of thee

Give every man thy ear but few thy voice

Take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment

Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy

But not expressed in fancy rich not gaudy

For the apparel oft proclaims the man

And they in France of the best rank and station

Are of a most select and generous chief in that

Neither a borrower nor a lender be

For loan oft loses both itself and friend

And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry

This above all to thine own self be true

And it must follow as the night the day

Thou canst not then be false to any man

Farewell My blessing season this in thee

The time invests you Go your servants tend

What is 't Ophelia he hath said to you

Marry well bethought

'Tis told me he hath very oft of late

Given private time to you and you yourself

Have of your audience been most free and bounteous

If it be so as so 'tis put on me

And that in way of caution I must tell you

You do not understand yourself so clearly

As it behooves my daughter and your honor

What is between you Give me up the truth

Affection puh You speak like a green girl

Unsifted in such perilous circumstance

Do you believe his tenders as you call them

Marry I will teach you Think yourself a baby

That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay

Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly

Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase

Running it thus you'll tender me a fool

Ay fashion you may call it Go to go to

Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know

When the blood burns how prodigal the soul

Lends the tongue vows These blazes daughter

Giving more light than heat extinct in both

Even in their promise as it is a-making

You must not take for fire From this time

Be something scanter of your maiden presence

Set your entreatments at a higher rate

Than a command to parle For Lord Hamlet

Believe so much in him that he is young

And with a larger tether may he walk

Than may be given you In few Ophelia

Do not believe his vows for they are brokers

Not of that dye which their investments show

But mere implorators of unholy suits

Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds

The better to beguile This is for all

I would not in plain terms from this time forth

Have you so slander any moment leisure

As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet

Look to 't I charge you Come your ways

Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo

You shall do marvelous wisely good Reynaldo

Before you visit him to make inquire

Of his behavior

Marry well said very well said Look you sir

Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris

And how and who what means and where they keep

What company at what expense and finding

By this encompassment and drift of question

That they do know my son come you more nearer

Than your particular demands will touch it

Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him

As thus I know his father and his friends

And in part him Do you mark this Reynaldo

And in part him but you may say not well

But if 't be he I mean he's very wild

Addicted so and so And there put on him

What forgeries you pleasemarry none so rank

As may dishonor him take heed of that

But sir such wanton wild and usual slips

As are companions noted and most known

To youth and liberty

Ay or drinking fencing swearing

Quarreling drabbingyou may go so far

Faith no as you may season it in the charge

You must not put another scandal on him

That he is open to incontinency

That's not my meaning But breathe his faults so quaintly

That they may seem the taints of liberty

The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind

A savageness in unreclaimd blood

Of general assault

Wherefore should you do this

Marry sir here's my drift

And I believe it is a fetch of wit

You laying these slight sullies on my son

As 'twere a thing a little soiled i' th' working

Mark you your party in converse him you would sound

Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes

The youth you breathe of guilty be assured

He closes with you in this consequence

Good sir or so or friend or gentleman

According to the phrase or the addition

Of man and country

And then sir does he this he doeswhat

was I about to say By the Mass I was about to say

something Where did I leave

At closes in the consequenceay marry

He closes thus I know the gentleman

I saw him yesterday or th' other day

Or then or then with such or such and as you say

There was he gaming there o'ertook in 's rouse

There falling out at tennis or perchance

I saw him enter such a house of sale

Videlicet a brothelor so forth See you now

Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth

And thus do we of wisdom and of reach

With windlasses and with assays of bias

By indirections find directions out

So by my former lecture and advice

Shall you my son You have me have you not

God be wi' you Fare you well

Observe his inclination in yourself

And let him ply his music

Farewell    How now Ophelia what's the matter

With what i' th' name of God

Mad for thy love

What said he

Come go with me I will go seek the King

This is the very ecstasy of love

Whose violent property fordoes itself

And leads the will to desperate undertakings

As oft as any passions under heaven

That does afflict our natures I am sorry

What have you given him any hard words of late

That hath made him mad

I am sorry that with better heed and judgment

I had not coted him I feared he did but trifle

And meant to wrack thee But beshrew my jealousy

By heaven it is as proper to our age

To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions

As it is common for the younger sort

To lack discretion Come go we to the King

This must be known which being kept close might move

More grief to hide than hate to utter love

Come

Th' ambassadors from Norway my good lord

Are joyfully returned

Have I my lord I assure my good liege

I hold my duty as I hold my soul

Both to my God and to my gracious king

And I do think or else this brain of mine

Hunts not the trail of policy so sure

As it hath used to do that I have found

The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy

Give first admittance to th' ambassadors

My news shall be the fruit to that great feast

This business is well ended

My liege and madam to expostulate

What majesty should be what duty is

Why day is day night night and time is time

Were nothing but to waste night day and time

Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit

And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes

I will be brief Your noble son is mad

Mad call I it for to define true madness

What is 't but to be nothing else but mad

But let that go

Madam I swear I use no art at all

That he's mad 'tis true 'tis true 'tis pity

And pity 'tis 'tis truea foolish figure

But farewell it for I will use no art

Mad let us grant him then and now remains

That we find out the cause of this effect

Or rather say the cause of this defect

For this effect defective comes by cause

Thus it remains and the remainder thus

Perpend

I have a daughter have while she is mine

Who in her duty and obedience mark

Hath given me this Now gather and surmise

To the celestial and my soul's idol the

most beautified Ophelia

That's an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a

vile phrase But you shall hear Thus

In her excellent white bosom these etc

Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful

Doubt thou the stars are fire

Doubt that the sun doth move

Doubt truth to be a liar

But never doubt I love

O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not

art to reckon my groans but that I love thee best O

most best believe it Adieu

Thine evermore most dear lady whilst

this machine is to him Hamlet

This in obedience hath my daughter shown me

And more above hath his solicitings

As they fell out by time by means and place

All given to mine ear

What do you think of me

I would fain prove so But what might you think

When I had seen this hot love on the wing

As I perceived it I must tell you that

Before my daughter told me what might you

Or my dear Majesty your queen here think

If I had played the desk or table-book

Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb

Or looked upon this love with idle sight

What might you think No I went round to work

And my young mistress thus I did bespeak

Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star

This must not be And then I prescripts gave her

That she should lock herself from his resort

Admit no messengers receive no tokens

Which done she took the fruits of my advice

And he repelled a short tale to make

Fell into a sadness then into a fast

Thence to a watch thence into a weakness

Thence to a lightness and by this declension

Into the madness wherein now he raves

And all we mourn for

Hath there been such a time I would fain know that

That I have positively said 'Tis so

When it proved otherwise

Take this from this if this be otherwise

If circumstances lead me I will find

Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed

Within the center

You know sometimes he walks four hours together

Here in the lobby

At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him

Be you and I behind an arras then

Mark the encounter If he love her not

And be not from his reason fall'n thereon

Let me be no assistant for a state

But keep a farm and carters

Away I do beseech you both away

I'll board him presently O give me leave

How does my good Lord Hamlet

Do you know me my lord

Not I my lord

Honest my lord

That's very true my lord

I have my lord

How say you by that Still harping on

my daughter Yet he knew me not at first he said I

was a fishmonger He is far gone And truly in my

youth I suffered much extremity for love very near

this I'll speak to him againWhat do you read my

lord

What is the matter my lord

I mean the matter that you read my lord

Though this be madness yet there is

method in 'tWill you walk out of the air my lord

Indeed that's out of the air How

pregnant sometimes his replies are A happiness

that often madness hits on which reason and

sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I

will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of

meeting between him and my daughterMy lord

I will take my leave of you

Fare you well my lord

You go to seek the Lord Hamlet There he is

Well be with you gentlemen

My lord I have news to tell you

The actors are come hither my lord

Upon my honor

The best actors in the world either for

tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical

historical-pastoral tragical-historical

tragical-comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or

poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor

Plautus too light For the law of writ and the liberty

these are the only men

What a treasure had he my lord

Still on my daughter

If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a

daughter that I love passing well

What follows then my lord

'Fore God my lord well spoken with good

accent and good discretion

This is too long

That's good Mobld queen is good

Look whe'er he has not turned his color and

has tears in 's eyes Prithee no more

My lord I will use them according to their

desert

Come sirs

'Tis most true

And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties

To hear and see the matter

Ophelia walk you hereGracious so please you

We will bestow ourselves Read on this book

That show of such an exercise may color

Your lonelinessWe are oft to blame in this

'Tis too much proved that with devotion's visage

And pious action we do sugar o'er

The devil himself

I hear him coming Let's withdraw my lord

It shall do well But yet do I believe

The origin and commencement of his grief

Sprung from neglected loveHow now Ophelia

You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said

We heard it allMy lord do as you please

But if you hold it fit after the play

Let his queen-mother all alone entreat him

To show his grief Let her be round with him

And I'll be placed so please you in the ear

Of all their conference If she find him not

To England send him or confine him where

Your wisdom best shall think

And the Queen too and that presently

That did I my lord and was accounted a

good actor

I did enact Julius Caesar I was killed i' th'

Capitol Brutus killed me

Oh ho Do you mark that

Give o'er the play

Lights lights lights

My lord the Queen would speak with you

and presently

By th' Mass and 'tis like a camel indeed

It is backed like a weasel

Very like a whale

I will say so

My lord he's going to his mother's closet

Behind the arras I'll convey myself

To hear the process I'll warrant she'll tax him home

And as you said and wisely was it said

'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother

Since nature makes them partial should o'erhear

The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege

I'll call upon you ere you go to bed

And tell you what I know

He will come straight Look you lay home to him

Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with

And that your Grace hath screened and stood between

Much heat and him I'll silence me even here

Pray you be round with him

What ho Help

O I am slain
