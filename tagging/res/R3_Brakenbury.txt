


I beseech your Graces both to pardon me

His Majesty hath straitly given in charge

That no man shall have private conference

Of what degree soever with your brother

With this my lord myself have naught to do

I do beseech your Grace to pardon me and withal

Forbear your conference with the noble duke

Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours

Makes the night morning and the noontide night

Princes have but their titles for their glories

An outward honor for an inward toil

And for unfelt imaginations

They often feel a world of restless cares

So that between their titles and low name

There's nothing differs but the outward fame

What wouldst thou fellow And how cam'st thou hither

What so brief

I am in this commanded to deliver

The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands

I will not reason what is meant hereby

Because I will be guiltless from the meaning

There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys

I'll to the King and signify to him

That thus I have resigned to you my charge

Right well dear madam By your patience

I may not suffer you to visit them

The King hath strictly charged the contrary

I mean the Lord Protector

No madam no I may not leave it so

I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me
