


Speak thou for me and tell them what I did

Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head

Armed as we are let's stay within this house

You are old enough now and yet methinks you lose

Father tear the crown from the usurper's head

Sound drums and trumpets and the King will fly

Brother though I be youngest give me leave

About that which concerns your Grace and us

The crown of England father which is yours

Your right depends not on his life or death

No God forbid your Grace should be forsworn

I'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak

An oath is of no moment being not took

Before a true and lawful magistrate

That hath authority over him that swears

Henry had none but did usurp the place

Then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose

Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous

Therefore to arms And father do but think

How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown

Within whose circuit is Elysium

And all that poets feign of bliss and joy

Why do we linger thus I cannot rest

Until the white rose that I wear be dyed

Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart

Ay with five hundred father for a need

A woman's general what should we fear

I cannot joy until I be resolved

Where our right valiant father is become

I saw him in the battle range about

And watched him how he singled Clifford forth

Methought he bore him in the thickest troop

As doth a lion in a herd of neat

Or as a bear encompassed round with dogs

Who having pinched a few and made them cry

The rest stand all aloof and bark at him

So fared our father with his enemies

So fled his enemies my warlike father

Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son

See how the morning opes her golden gates

And takes her farewell of the glorious sun

How well resembles it the prime of youth

Trimmed like a younker prancing to his love

Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun

Not separated with the racking clouds

But severed in a pale clear-shining sky

See see they join embrace and seem to kiss

As if they vowed some league inviolable

Now are they but one lamp one light one sun

In this the heaven figures some event

Nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it

You love the breeder better than the male

But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell

Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue

Say how he died for I will hear it all

I cannot weep for all my body's moisture

Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart

Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden

For selfsame wind that I should speak withal

Is kindling coals that fires all my breast

And burns me up with flames that tears would quench

To weep is to make less the depth of grief

Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me

Richard I bear thy name I'll venge thy death

Or die renownd by attempting it

Nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird

Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun

For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say

Either that is thine or else thou wert not his

Great lord of Warwick if we should recount

Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance

Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told

The words would add more anguish than the wounds

O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain

'Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled

Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit

But ne'er till now his scandal of retire

I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not

'Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak

But in this troublous time what's to be done

Shall we go throw away our coats of steel

And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns

Numb'ring our Ave Marys with our beads

Or shall we on the helmets of our foes

Tell our devotion with revengeful arms

If for the last say Ay and to it lords

Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak

Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day

That cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay

Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel

As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds

I come to pierce it or to give thee mine

Are you there butcher O I cannot speak

'Twas you that killed young Rutland was it not

For God's sake lords give signal to the fight

Northumberland I hold thee reverently

Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain

The execution of my big-swoll'n heart

Upon that Clifford that cruel child-killer

Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward

As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland

But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed

Then executioner unsheathe thy sword

By Him that made us all I am resolved

That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue

Whoever got thee there thy mother stands

For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue

Iron of Naples hid with English gilt

Whose father bears the title of a king

As if a channel should be called the sea

Sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught

To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart

Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself

Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk

Broached with the steely point of Clifford's lance

And in the very pangs of death he cried

Like to a dismal clangor heard from far

Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death

So underneath the belly of their steeds

That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood

The noble gentleman gave up the ghost

Brother give me thy handAnd gentle Warwick

Let me embrace thee in my weary arms

I that did never weep now melt with woe

That winter should cut off our springtime so

Now Clifford I have singled thee alone

Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York

And this for Rutland both bound to revenge

Wert thou environed with a brazen wall

Nay Warwick single out some other chase

For I myself will hunt this wolf to death

Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave

A deadly groan like life and death's departing

Revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis Clifford

Who not contented that he lopped the branch

In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth

But set his murd'ring knife unto the root

From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring

I mean our princely father Duke of York

O would he didand so perhaps he doth

'Tis but his policy to counterfeit

Because he would avoid such bitter taunts

Which in the time of death he gave our father

Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace

Thou didst love York and I am son to York

What not an oath Nay then the world goes hard

When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath

I know by that he's dead and by my soul

If this right hand would buy but two hours' life

That I in all despite might rail at him

This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood

Stifle the villain whose unstaunchd thirst

York and young Rutland could not satisfy

Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester

For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous

Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit

It were dishonor to deny it her

Yea is it so

I see the lady hath a thing to grant

Before the King will grant her humble suit

Silence

Ay widow Then I'll warrant you all your lands

An if what pleases him shall pleasure you

Fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow

God forbid that for he'll take vantages

Nay then whip me he'll rather give her two

You shall have four if you'll be ruled by him

Ay good leave have you for you will have leave

Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch

He plies her hard and much rain wears the marble

The match is made she seals it with a cursy

The widow likes him not she knits her brows

The ghostly father now hath done his shrift

The widow likes it not for she looks very sad

That would be ten days' wonder at the least

By so much is the wonder in extremes

Ay Edward will use women honorably

Would he were wastedmarrow bones and all

That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring

To cross me from the golden time I look for

And yet between my soul's desire and me

The lustful Edward's title burid

Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward

And all the unlooked-for issue of their bodies

To take their rooms ere I can place myself

A cold premeditation for my purpose

Why then I do but dream on sovereignty

Like one that stands upon a promontory

And spies a far-off shore where he would tread

Wishing his foot were equal with his eye

And chides the sea that sunders him from thence

Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way

So do I wish the crown being so far off

And so I chide the means that keeps me from it

And so I say I'll cut the causes off

Flattering me with impossibilities

My eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much

Unless my hand and strength could equal them

Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard

What other pleasure can the world afford

I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap

And deck my body in gay ornaments

And 'witch sweet ladies with my words and looks

O miserable thought and more unlikely

Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns

Why Love forswore me in my mother's womb

And for I should not deal in her soft laws

She did corrupt frail Nature with some bribe

To shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub

To make an envious mountain on my back

Where sits Deformity to mock my body

To shape my legs of an unequal size

To disproportion me in every part

Like to a chaos or an unlicked bear-whelp

That carries no impression like the dam

And am I then a man to be beloved

O monstrous fault to harbor such a thought

Then since this Earth affords no joy to me

But to command to check to o'erbear such

As are of better person than myself

I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown

And whiles I live t' account this world but hell

Until my misshaped trunk that bears this head

Be round impald with a glorious crown

And yet I know not how to get the crown

For many lives stand between me and home

And I like one lost in a thorny wood

That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns

Seeking a way and straying from the way

Not knowing how to find the open air

But toiling desperately to find it out

Torment myself to catch the English crown

And from that torment I will free myself

Or hew my way out with a bloody axe

Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile

And cry Content to that which grieves my heart

And wet my cheeks with artificial tears

And frame my face to all occasions

I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall

I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk

I'll play the orator as well as Nestor

Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could

And like a Sinon take another Troy

I can add colors to the chameleon

Change shapes with Proteus for advantages

And set the murderous Machiavel to school

Can I do this and cannot get a crown

Tut were it farther off I'll pluck it down

Now tell me brother Clarence what think you

Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey

Hath not our brother made a worthy choice

And his well-chosen bride

And shall have your will because our king

Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well

Not I

No God forbid that I should wish them severed

Whom God hath joined together Ay and 'twere pity

To sunder them that yoke so well together

And Warwick doing what you gave in charge

Is now dishonord by this new marriage

And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well

To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales

Unto the brother of your loving bride

She better would have fitted me or Clarence

But in your bride you bury brotherhood

I hear yet say not much but think the more

Not I My thoughts aim at a further matter

I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown

Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you

Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley

Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither

Into this chiefest thicket of the park

Thus stands the case you know our king my brother

Is prisoner to the Bishop here at whose hands

He hath good usage and great liberty

And often but attended with weak guard

Comes hunting this way to disport himself

I have advertised him by secret means

That if about this hour he make this way

Under the color of his usual game

He shall here find his friends with horse and men

To set him free from his captivity

Brother the time and case requireth haste

Your horse stands ready at the park corner

Well guessed believe me for that was my meaning

But wherefore stay we 'Tis no time to talk

Come then away Let's ha' no more ado

The gates made fast Brother I like not this

For many men that stumble at the threshold

Are well foretold that danger lurks within

But when the fox hath once got in his nose

He'll soon find means to make the body follow

A wise stout captain and soon persuaded

Brother this is Sir John Montgomery

Our trusty friend unless I be deceived

Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points

And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns

Brother we will proclaim you out of hand

The bruit thereof will bring you many friends

Long live Edward the Fourth

Away betimes before his forces join

And take the great-grown traitor unawares

Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry

See how the surly Warwick mans the wall

I thought at least he would have said the King

Or did he make the jest against his will

Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give

I'll do thee service for so good a gift

Alas that Warwick had no more forecast

But whiles he thought to steal the single ten

The King was slyly fingered from the deck

You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace

And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower

Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down

Nay when Strike now or else the iron cools

The gates are open let us enter too

Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason

Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear

Two of thy name both dukes of Somerset

Have sold their lives unto the house of York

And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold

Welcome good Clarence this is brother-like

The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong

And Somerset with Oxford fled to her

If she have time to breathe be well assured

Her faction will be full as strong as ours

It is and lo where youthful Edward comes

That you might still have worn the petticoat

And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster

By heaven brat I'll plague you for that word

For God's sake take away this captive scold

Sprawl'st thou Take that to end thy agony

Marry and shall

Why should she live to fill the world with words

Clarence excuse me to the King my brother

I'll hence to London on a serious matter

Ere you come there be sure to hear some news

The Tower the Tower

Good day my lord What at your book so hard

Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer

Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind

The thief doth fear each bush an officer

Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete

That taught his son the office of a fowl

And yet for all his wings the fool was drowned

Think'st thou I am an executioner

Thy son I killed for his presumption

I'll hear no more Die prophet in thy speech

For this amongst the rest was I ordained

What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster

Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted

See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death

O may such purple tears be always shed

From those that wish the downfall of our house

If any spark of life be yet remaining

Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither

I that have neither pity love nor fear

Indeed 'tis true that Henry told me of

For I have often heard my mother say

I came into the world with my legs forward

Had I not reason think you to make haste

And seek their ruin that usurped our right

The midwife wondered and the women cried

O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth

And so I was which plainly signified

That I should snarl and bite and play the dog

Then since the heavens have shaped my body so

Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it

I have no brother I am like no brother

And this word love which graybeards call divine

Be resident in men like one another

And not in me I am myself alone

Clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light

But I will sort a pitchy day for thee

For I will buzz abroad such prophecies

That Edward shall be fearful of his life

And then to purge his fear I'll be thy death

King Henry and the Prince his son are gone

Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest

Counting myself but bad till I be best

I'll throw thy body in another room

And triumph Henry in thy day of doom

I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid

For yet I am not looked on in the world

This shoulder was ordained so thick to heave

And heave it shall some weight or break my back

Work thou the way and that shalt execute

And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st

Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit

To say the truth so Judas kissed his master

And cried All hail whenas he meant all harm
