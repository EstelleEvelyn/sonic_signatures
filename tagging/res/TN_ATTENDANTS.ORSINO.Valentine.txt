


So please my lord I might not be admitted

But from her handmaid do return this answer

The element itself till seven years' heat

Shall not behold her face at ample view

But like a cloistress she will veild walk

And water once a day her chamber round

With eye-offending brineall this to season

A brother's dead love which she would keep fresh

And lasting in her sad remembrance

If the Duke continue these favors towards

you Cesario you are like to be much advanced He

hath known you but three days and already you

are no stranger

No believe me
