Sit good cousin Hotspur for by that name

As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you

His cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh

He wisheth you in heaven

I cannot blame him At my nativity

The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes

Of burning cressets and at my birth

The frame and huge foundation of the Earth

Shaked like a coward

I say the Earth did shake when I was born

The heavens were all on fire the Earth did tremble

Cousin of many men

I do not bear these crossings Give me leave

To tell you once again that at my birth

The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes

The goats ran from the mountains and the herds

Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields

These signs have marked me extraordinary

And all the courses of my life do show

I am not in the roll of common men

Where is he living clipped in with the sea

That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales

Which calls me pupil or hath read to me

And bring him out that is but woman's son

Can trace me in the tedious ways of art

And hold me pace in deep experiments

I can call spirits from the vasty deep

Why I can teach you cousin to command the devil

Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head

Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye

And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him

Bootless home and weather-beaten back

Come here is the map Shall we divide our right

According to our threefold order ta'en

A shorter time shall send me to you lords

And in my conduct shall your ladies come

From whom you now must steal and take no leave

For there will be a world of water shed

Upon the parting of your wives and you

Not wind It shall it must You see it doth

I'll not have it altered

No nor you shall not

Why that will I

I can speak English lord as well as you

For I was trained up in the English court

Where being but young I framd to the harp

Many an English ditty lovely well

And gave the tongue a helpful ornament

A virtue that was never seen in you

Come you shall have Trent turned

The moon shines fair You may away by night

I'll haste the writer and withal

Break with your wives of your departure hence

I am afraid my daughter will run mad

So much she doteth on her Mortimer

My daughter weeps she'll not part with you

She'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars

She is desperate here a peevish self-willed harlotry

One that no persuasion can do good upon

Nay if you melt then will she run mad

She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down

And rest your gentle head upon her lap

And she will sing the song that pleaseth you

And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep

Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness

Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep

As is the difference betwixt day and night

The hour before the heavenly harnessed team

Begins his golden progress in the east

Do so and those musicians that shall play to you

Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence

And straight they shall be here Sit and attend

Come come Lord Mortimer you are as slow

As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go

By this our book is drawn We'll but seal

And then to horse immediately
