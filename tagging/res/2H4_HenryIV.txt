


Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick

But ere they come bid them o'erread these letters

And well consider of them Make good speed

How many thousand of my poorest subjects

Are at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep

Nature's soft nurse how have I frighted thee

That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down

And steep my senses in forgetfulness

Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs

Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee

And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber

Than in the perfumed chambers of the great

Under the canopies of costly state

And lulled with sound of sweetest melody

O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile

In loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch

A watch-case or a common 'larum bell

Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast

Seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains

In cradle of the rude imperious surge

And in the visitation of the winds

Who take the ruffian billows by the top

Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them

With deafing clamor in the slippery clouds

That with the hurly death itself awakes

Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose

To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude

And in the calmest and most stillest night

With all appliances and means to boot

Deny it to a king Then happy low lie down

Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

Is it good morrow lords

Why then good morrow to you all my lords

Have you read o'er the letter that I sent you

Then you perceive the body of our kingdom

How foul it is what rank diseases grow

And with what danger near the heart of it

O God that one might read the book of fate

And see the revolution of the times

Make mountains level and the continent

Weary of solid firmness melt itself

Into the sea and other times to see

The beachy girdle of the ocean

Too wide for Neptune's hips how chance's mocks

And changes fill the cup of alteration

With divers liquors O if this were seen

The happiest youth viewing his progress through

What perils past what crosses to ensue

Would shut the book and sit him down and die

'Tis not ten years gone

Since Richard and Northumberland great friends

Did feast together and in two years after

Were they at wars It is but eight years since

This Percy was the man nearest my soul

Who like a brother toiled in my affairs

And laid his love and life under my foot

Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard

Gave him defiance But which of you was by

You cousin Nevil as I may remember

When Richard with his eye brimful of tears

Then checked and rated by Northumberland

Did speak these words now proved a prophecy

Northumberland thou ladder by the which

My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne

Though then God knows I had no such intent

But that necessity so bowed the state

That I and greatness were compelled to kiss

The time shall come thus did he follow it

The time will come that foul sin gathering head

Shall break into corruptionso went on

Foretelling this same time's condition

And the division of our amity

Are these things then necessities

Then let us meet them like necessities

And that same word even now cries out on us

They say the Bishop and Northumberland

Are fifty thousand strong

I will take your counsel

And were these inward wars once out of hand

We would dear lords unto the Holy Land

Now lords if God doth give successful end

To this debate that bleedeth at our doors

We will our youth lead on to higher fields

And draw no swords but what are sanctified

Our navy is addressed our power collected

Our substitutes in absence well invested

And everything lies level to our wish

Only we want a little personal strength

And pause us till these rebels now afoot

Come underneath the yoke of government

Humphrey my son of Gloucester where is the Prince your brother

And how accompanied

Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him

Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence

How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother

He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas

Thou hast a better place in his affection

Than all thy brothers Cherish it my boy

And noble offices thou mayst effect

Of mediation after I am dead

Between his greatness and thy other brethren

Therefore omit him not blunt not his love

Nor lose the good advantage of his grace

By seeming cold or careless of his will

For he is gracious if he be observed

He hath a tear for pity and a hand

Open as day for melting charity

Yet notwithstanding being incensed he is flint

As humorous as winter and as sudden

As flaws congeald in the spring of day

His temper therefore must be well observed

Chide him for faults and do it reverently

When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth

But being moody give him time and scope

Till that his passions like a whale on ground

Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas

And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends

A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in

That the united vessel of their blood

Mingled with venom of suggestion

As force perforce the age will pour it in

Shall never leak though it do work as strong

As aconitum or rash gunpowder

Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas

And how accompanied Canst thou tell that

Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds

And he the noble image of my youth

Is overspread with them therefore my grief

Stretches itself beyond the hour of death

The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape

In forms imaginary th' unguided days

And rotten times that you shall look upon

When I am sleeping with my ancestors

For when his headstrong riot hath no curb

When rage and hot blood are his counsellors

When means and lavish manners meet together

O with what wings shall his affections fly

Towards fronting peril and opposed decay

'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb

In the dead carrion    Who's here Westmoreland

O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird

Which ever in the haunch of winter sings

The lifting up of day    Look here's more news

And wherefore should these good news make me sick

Will Fortune never come with both hands full

But write her fair words still in foulest letters

She either gives a stomach and no food

Such are the poor in healthor else a feast

And takes away the stomachsuch are the rich

That have abundance and enjoy it not

I should rejoice now at this happy news

And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy

O me Come near me now I am much ill

I pray you take me up and bear me hence

Into some other chamber Softly pray

Let there be no noise made my gentle friends

Unless some dull and favorable hand

Will whisper music to my weary spirit

Set me the crown upon my pillow here

Warwick Gloucester

Clarence

Why did you leave me here alone my lords

The Prince of Wales Where is he Let me see him

He is not here

Where is the crown Who took it from my pillow

The Prince hath ta'en it hence Go seek him out

Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death

Find him my Lord of Warwick Chide him hither

This part of his conjoins with my disease

And helps to end me See sons what things you are

How quickly nature falls into revolt

When gold becomes her object

For this the foolish overcareful fathers

Have broke their sleep with thoughts

Their brains with care their bones with industry

For this they have engrossd and piled up

The cankered heaps of strange-achievd gold

For this they have been thoughtful to invest

Their sons with arts and martial exercises

When like the bee tolling from every flower

The virtuous sweets

Our thighs packed with wax our mouths with honey

We bring it to the hive and like the bees

Are murdered for our pains This bitter taste

Yields his engrossments to the ending father

Now where is he that will not stay so long

Till his friend sickness hath determined me

But wherefore did he take away the crown

Lo where he comesCome hither to me Harry

Depart the chamber Leave us here alone

Thy wish was father Harry to that thought

I stay too long by thee I weary thee

Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair

That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors

Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth

Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee

Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity

Is held from falling with so weak a wind

That it will quickly drop My day is dim

Thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours

Were thine without offense and at my death

Thou hast sealed up my expectation

Thy life did manifest thou loved'st me not

And thou wilt have me die assured of it

Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts

Whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart

To stab at half an hour of my life

What canst thou not forbear me half an hour

Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself

And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear

That thou art crownd not that I am dead

Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse

Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head

Only compound me with forgotten dust

Give that which gave thee life unto the worms

Pluck down my officers break my decrees

For now a time is come to mock at form

Harry the Fifth is crowned Up vanity

Down royal state all you sage councillors hence

And to the English court assemble now

From every region apes of idleness

Now neighbor confines purge you of your scum

Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance

Revel the night rob murder and commit

The oldest sins the newest kind of ways

Be happy he will trouble you no more

England shall double gild his treble guilt

England shall give him office honor might

For the fifth Harry from curbed license plucks

The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog

Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent

O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows

When that my care could not withhold thy riots

What wilt thou do when riot is thy care

O thou wilt be a wilderness again

Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants

O my son

God put it in thy mind to take it hence

That thou mightst win the more thy father's love

Pleading so wisely in excuse of it

Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed

And hear I think the very latest counsel

That ever I shall breathe  God knows my son

By what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways

I met this crown and I myself know well

How troublesome it sat upon my head

To thee it shall descend with better quiet

Better opinion better confirmation

For all the soil of the achievement goes

With me into the earth It seemed in me

But as an honor snatched with boist'rous hand

And I had many living to upbraid

My gain of it by their assistances

Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed

Wounding supposd peace All these bold fears

Thou seest with peril I have answerd

For all my reign hath been but as a scene

Acting that argument And now my death

Changes the mood for what in me was purchased

Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort

So thou the garland wear'st successively

Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do

Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green

And all my friends which thou must make thy friends

Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out

By whose fell working I was first advanced

And by whose power I well might lodge a fear

To be again displaced which to avoid

I cut them off and had a purpose now

To lead out many to the Holy Land

Lest rest and lying still might make them look

Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry

Be it thy course to busy giddy minds

With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out

May waste the memory of the former days

More would I but my lungs are wasted so

That strength of speech is utterly denied me

How I came by the crown O God forgive

And grant it may with thee in true peace live

Look look here comes my John of Lancaster

Thou bring'st me happiness and peace son John

But health alack with youthful wings is flown

From this bare withered trunk Upon thy sight

My worldly business makes a period

Where is my Lord of Warwick

Doth any name particular belong

Unto the lodging where I first did swoon

Laud be to God Even there my life must end

It hath been prophesied to me many years

I should not die but in Jerusalem

Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land

But bear me to that chamber there I'll lie

In that Jerusalem shall Harry die
