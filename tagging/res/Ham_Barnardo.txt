


Who's there

Long live the King

He

'Tis now struck twelve Get thee to bed Francisco

Have you had quiet guard

Well good night

If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus

The rivals of my watch bid them make haste

Say what is Horatio there

Welcome HoratioWelcome good Marcellus

I have seen nothing

Sit down awhile

And let us once again assail your ears

That are so fortified against our story

What we have two nights seen

Last night of all

When yond same star that's westward from the pole

Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven

Where now it burns Marcellus and myself

The bell then beating one

In the same figure like the King that's dead

Looks he not like the King Mark it Horatio

It would be spoke to

See it stalks away

How now Horatio you tremble and look pale

Is not this something more than fantasy

What think you on 't

I think it be no other but e'en so

Well may it sort that this portentous figure

Comes armd through our watch so like the king

That was and is the question of these wars

'Tis here

It was about to speak when the cock crew

We do my lord

Armed my lord

My lord from head to foot

Longer longer

Our duty to your Honor
