


First pardon me my lord A hue and cry

Hath followed certain men unto this house

One of them is well known my gracious lord

A gross fat man

I will my lord There are two gentlemen

Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks

Good night my noble lord

Indeed my lord I think it be two o'clock
