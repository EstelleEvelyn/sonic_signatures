


A segregation of the Turkish fleet

For do but stand upon the foaming shore

The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds

The wind-shaked surge with high and monstrous mane

Seems to cast water on the burning Bear

And quench the guards of th' ever-fixd pole

I never did like molestation view

On the enchafd flood

They do discharge their shot of courtesy

Our friends at least

I shall

'Tis one Iago ancient to the General

They give their greeting to the citadel

This likewise is a friend
