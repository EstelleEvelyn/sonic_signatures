
I shall report,

For most it caught me, the celestial habits—

Methinks I so should term them—and the reverence

Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice,

How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly

It was i’ th’ off’ring!

If th’ event o’ th’ journey

Prove as successful to the Queen—O, be ’t so!—

As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,

The time is worth the use on ’t.

The violent carriage of it

Will clear or end the business when the oracle,

Thus by Apollo’s great divine sealed up,

Shall the contents discover. Something rare

Even then will rush to knowledge. Go. Fresh horses;

And gracious be the issue.

All this we swear.

If you would not so,

You pity not the state nor the remembrance

Of his most sovereign name, consider little

What dangers by his Highness’ fail of issue

May drop upon his kingdom and devour

Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy

Than to rejoice the former queen is well?

What holier than, for royalty’s repair,

For present comfort, and for future good,

To bless the bed of majesty again

With a sweet fellow to ’t?
