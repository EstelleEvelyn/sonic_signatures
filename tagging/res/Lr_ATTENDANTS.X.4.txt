which since his coming forth is thought of, which

imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger

that his personal return was most required and

necessary.

The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.

Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence,

And now and then an ample tear trilled down

Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen

Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,

Fought to be king o’er her.

Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove

Who should express her goodliest. You have seen

Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears

Were like a better way. Those happy smilets

That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know

What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence

As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,

Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved

If all could so become it.

Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father”

Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart;

Cried “Sisters, sisters, shame of ladies, sisters!

Kent, father, sisters! What, i’ th’ storm, i’ th’ night?

Let pity not be believed!” There she shook

The holy water from her heavenly eyes,

And clamor moistened. Then away she started,

To deal with grief alone.

No.

No, since.

Why, good sir?

Alack, poor gentleman!

’Tis so. They are afoot.
