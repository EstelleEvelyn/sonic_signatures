


Here they'll be man Some o' their

plants are ill-rooted already The least wind i' th'

world will blow them down

They have made him drink alms-drink

But it raises the greater war between

him and his discretion

To be called into a huge sphere and not

to be seen to move in 't are the holes where eyes

should be which pitifully disaster the cheeks

The gods forbid
