The King of Naples, whosoe’er thou art.

Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so,

What ransom must I pay before I pass?

For I perceive I am thy prisoner.

Why speak’st thou not? What ransom must I pay?

Wilt thou accept of ransom, yea or no?

I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.

He talks at random; sure the man is mad.

And yet I would that you would answer me.

He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.

Hear you, captain? Are you not at leisure?

What though I be enthralled, he seems a knight,

And will not any way dishonor me.

Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French,

And then I need not crave his courtesy.

Tush, women have been captivate ere now.

I cry you mercy, ’tis but quid for quo.

To be a queen in bondage is more vile

Than is a slave in base servility,

For princes should be free.

Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?

What?

I am unworthy to be Henry’s wife.

An if my father please, I am content.

Farewell, my lord; good wishes, praise, and prayers

Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.

Such commendations as becomes a maid,

A virgin, and his servant, say to him.

Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,

Never yet taint with love, I send the King.

That for thyself. I will not so presume

To send such peevish tokens to a king.
