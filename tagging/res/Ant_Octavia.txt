
All which time

Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers

To them for you

My noble brother

Sir look well to my husband's house and

I'll tell you in your ear

O my good lord

Believe not all or if you must believe

Stomach not all A more unhappy lady

If this division chance ne'er stood between

Praying for both parts

The good gods will mock me presently

When I shall pray O bless my lord and husband

Undo that prayer by crying out as loud

O bless my brother Husband win win brother

Prays and destroys the prayer no midway

'Twixt these extremes at all

Thanks to my lord

The Jove of power make me most weak most weak

Your reconciler Wars 'twixt you twain would be

As if the world should cleave and that slain men

Should solder up the rift

Hail Caesar and my lord Hail most dear Caesar

You have not called me so nor have you cause

Good my lord

To come thus was I not constrained but did it

On my free will My lord Mark Antony

Hearing that you prepared for war acquainted

My grievd ear withal whereon I begged

His pardon for return

Do not say so my lord

My lord in Athens

Ay me most wretched

That have my heart parted betwixt two friends

That does afflict each other

Is it so sir
