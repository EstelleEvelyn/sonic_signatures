


Save you good madam

Ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed

'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply

Which his heart was not consenting to

A servant only and a gentleman

Which I have sometime known

Ay my good lady he

Indeed good lady

The fellow has a deal of that too much

Which holds him much to have
