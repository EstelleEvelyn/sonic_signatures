
Nothing that I heard,

For I came home before the business

Was fully ended. Yet I might perceive,

Ere I departed, a great likelihood

Of both their pardons; for Hippolyta

And fair-eyed Emily, upon their knees,

Begged with such handsome pity that the Duke,

Methought, stood staggering whether he should follow

His rash oath or the sweet compassion

Of those two ladies. And, to second them,

That truly noble prince, Pirithous—

Half his own heart—set in too, that I hope

All shall be well. Neither heard I one question

Of your name or his ’scape.

How was it ended?

I knew ’twould be so.

’Twill be known.

These are strange questions.

Not right?

It cannot be.

Pretty soul!

Yes, he’s a fine man.

Yes.

Yes.

No.

Does she know him?

Owgh, owgh, owgh!—’Tis up!

The wind’s fair!—Top the bowline!—Out with the

main sail! Where’s your whistle, master?

Here.
