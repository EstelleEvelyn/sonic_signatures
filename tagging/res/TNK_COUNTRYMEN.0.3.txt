


And I

Ay do but put a fescue in her fist

and you shall see her take a new lesson out and be

a good wench Do we all hold against the Maying

Arcas will be there

He'll eat a hornbook ere he fail

Go to the matter's too far driven between him and

the tanner's daughter to let slip now and she must

see the Duke and she must dance too

We'll see the sports then every

man to 's tackle And sweet companions let's rehearse

by any means before the ladies see us and

do sweetly and God knows what may come on 't

To the games my friend

Thou wilt not go along

Why Timothy

Dispersed as you commanded

What shall we determine sir

There's a dainty madwoman master

comes i' th' nick as mad as a March hare If we

can get her dance we are made again I warrant

her she'll do the rarest gambols

Do do
