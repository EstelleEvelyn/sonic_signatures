


Good time of day unto your royal Grace

Madam good hope His Grace speaks cheerfully

Ay madam He desires to make atonement

Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers

And between them and my Lord Chamberlain

And sent to warn them to his royal presence

Northumberland then present wept to see it

Peace peace for shame if not for charity

Have done have done

Nor no one here for curses never pass

The lips of those that breathe them in the air

Nothing that I respect my gracious lord

My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses

Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate

Upon your Grace but with all duteous love

Doth cherish you and yours God punish me

With hate in those where I expect most love

When I have most need to employ a friend

And most assurd that he is a friend

Deep hollow treacherous and full of guile

Be he unto me this do I beg of God

When I am cold in love to you or yours

And in good time

Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the Duke

Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest

We wait upon your Grace

You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers

That bear this heavy mutual load of moan

Now cheer each other in each other's love

Though we have spent our harvest of this king

We are to reap the harvest of his son

The broken rancor of your high-swoll'n hates

But lately splintered knit and joined together

Must gently be preserved cherished and kept

Meseemeth good that with some little train

Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet

Hither to London to be crowned our king

Marry my lord lest by a multitude

The new-healed wound of malice should break out

Which would be so much the more dangerous

By how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned

Where every horse bears his commanding rein

And may direct his course as please himself

As well the fear of harm as harm apparent

In my opinion ought to be prevented

My lord whoever journeys to the Prince

For God's sake let not us two stay at home

For by the way I'll sort occasion

As index to the story we late talked of

To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince

Welcome sweet prince to London to your chamber

And in good time here comes the sweating lord

Fie what an indirect and peevish course

Is this of hersLord Cardinal will your Grace

Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York

Unto his princely brother presently

If she deny Lord Hastings go with him

And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce

You are too senseless obstinate my lord

Too ceremonious and traditional

Weigh it but with the grossness of this age

You break not sanctuary in seizing him

The benefit thereof is always granted

To those whose dealings have deserved the place

And those who have the wit to claim the place

This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it

And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it

Then taking him from thence that is not there

You break no privilege nor charter there

Oft have I heard of sanctuary men

But sanctuary children never till now

He did my gracious lord begin that place

Which since succeeding ages have re-edified

Upon record my gracious lord

What my gracious lord

Now in good time here comes the Duke of York

With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons

To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle

He prettily and aptly taunts himself

So cunning and so young is wonderful

Think you my lord this little prating York

Was not incensd by his subtle mother

To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously

Well let them restCome hither Catesby

Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend

As closely to conceal what we impart

Thou knowest our reasons urged upon the way

What thinkest thou Is it not an easy matter

To make William Lord Hastings of our mind

For the installment of this noble duke

In the seat royal of this famous isle

What think'st thou then of Stanley Will not he

Well then no more but this go gentle Catesby

And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings

How he doth stand affected to our purpose

And summon him tomorrow to the Tower

To sit about the coronation

If thou dost find him tractable to us

Encourage him and tell him all our reasons

If he be leaden icy cold unwilling

Be thou so too and so break off the talk

And give us notice of his inclination

For we tomorrow hold divided councils

Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed

Good Catesby go effect this business soundly

Now my lord what shall we do if we perceive

Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots

I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand

What talking with a priest Lord Chamberlain

Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest

Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand

I do my lord but long I cannot stay there

I shall return before your Lordship thence

And supper too although thou know'st it not

Come will you go

Is all things ready for the royal time

Who knows the Lord Protector's mind herein

Who is most inward with the noble duke

We know each other's faces for our hearts

He knows no more of mine than I of yours

Or I of his my lord than you of mine

Lord Hastings you and he are near in love

Had you not come upon your cue my lord

William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part

I mean your voice for crowning of the King

Withdraw yourself awhile I'll go with you

Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian

Speak and look back and pry on every side

Tremble and start at wagging of a straw

Intending deep suspicion Ghastly looks

Are at my service like enforcd smiles

And both are ready in their offices

At any time to grace my stratagems

But what is Catesby gone

Lord Mayor

Hark a drum

Lord Mayor the reason we have sent

God and our innocence defend and guard us

Well well he was the covert'st sheltered traitor

That ever lived

Would you imagine or almost believe

Were 't not that by great preservation

We live to tell it that the subtle traitor

This day had plotted in the council house

To murder me and my good lord of Gloucester

I never looked for better at his hands

After he once fell in with Mistress Shore

Yet had we not determined he should die

Until your Lordship came to see his end

Which now the loving haste of these our friends

Something against our meanings have prevented

Because my lord I would have had you heard

The traitor speak and timorously confess

The manner and the purpose of his treasons

That you might well have signified the same

Unto the citizens who haply may

Misconster us in him and wail his death

Which since you come too late of our intent

Yet witness what you hear we did intend

And so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell

Doubt not my lord I'll play the orator

As if the golden fee for which I plead

Were for myself And so my lord adieu

I go and towards three or four o'clock

Look for the news that the Guildhall affords

Now by the holy mother of our Lord

The citizens are mum say not a word

I did with his contract with Lady Lucy

And his contract by deputy in France

Th' unsatiate greediness of his desire

And his enforcement of the city wives

His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy

As being got your father then in France

And his resemblance being not like the Duke

Withal I did infer your lineaments

Being the right idea of your father

Both in your form and nobleness of mind

Laid open all your victories in Scotland

Your discipline in war wisdom in peace

Your bounty virtue fair humility

Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose

Untouched or slightly handled in discourse

And when mine oratory drew toward end

I bid them that did love their country's good

Cry God save Richard England's royal king

No So God help me they spake not a word

But like dumb statues or breathing stones

Stared each on other and looked deadly pale

Which when I saw I reprehended them

And asked the Mayor what meant this willful silence

His answer was the people were not used

To be spoke to but by the Recorder

Then he was urged to tell my tale again

Thus saith the Duke Thus hath the Duke inferred

But nothing spoke in warrant from himself

When he had done some followers of mine own

At lower end of the hall hurled up their caps

And some ten voices cried God save King Richard

And thus I took the vantage of those few

Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I

This general applause and cheerful shout

Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard

And even here brake off and came away

The Mayor is here at hand Intend some fear

Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit

And look you get a prayer book in your hand

And stand between two churchmen good my lord

For on that ground I'll make a holy descant

And be not easily won to our requests

Play the maid's part still answer nay and take it

Go go up to the leads The Lord Mayor knocks

Welcome my lord I dance attendance here

I think the Duke will not be spoke withal

Now Catesby what says your lord to my request

Return good Catesby to the gracious duke

Tell him myself the Mayor and aldermen

In deep designs in matter of great moment

No less importing than our general good

Are come to have some conference with his Grace

Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward

He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed

But on his knees at meditation

Not dallying with a brace of courtesans

But meditating with two deep divines

Not sleeping to engross his idle body

But praying to enrich his watchful soul

Happy were England would this virtuous prince

Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof

But sure I fear we shall not win him to it

I fear he will Here Catesby comes again

Now Catesby what says his Grace

Sorry I am my noble cousin should

Suspect me that I mean no good to him

By heaven we come to him in perfect love

And so once more return and tell his Grace

When holy and devout religious men

Are at their beads 'tis much to draw them thence

So sweet is zealous contemplation

Two props of virtue for a Christian prince

To stay him from the fall of vanity

And see a book of prayer in his hand

True ornaments to know a holy man

Famous Plantagenet most gracious prince

Lend favorable ear to our requests

And pardon us the interruption

Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal

Even that I hope which pleaseth God above

And all good men of this ungoverned isle

You have my lord Would it might please your Grace

On our entreaties to amend your fault

Know then it is your fault that you resign

The supreme seat the throne majestical

The sceptered office of your ancestors

Your state of fortune and your due of birth

The lineal glory of your royal house

To the corruption of a blemished stock

Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts

Which here we waken to our country's good

The noble isle doth want her proper limbs

Her face defaced with scars of infamy

Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants

And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf

Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion

Which to recure we heartily solicit

Your gracious self to take on you the charge

And kingly government of this your land

Not as Protector steward substitute

Or lowly factor for another's gain

But as successively from blood to blood

Your right of birth your empery your own

For this consorted with the citizens

Your very worshipful and loving friends

And by their vehement instigation

In this just cause come I to move your Grace

My lord this argues conscience in your Grace

But the respects thereof are nice and trivial

All circumstances well considerd

You say that Edward is your brother's son

So say we too but not by Edward's wife

For first was he contract to Lady Lucy

Your mother lives a witness to his vow

And afterward by substitute betrothed

To Bona sister to the King of France

These both put off a poor petitioner

A care-crazed mother to a many sons

A beauty-waning and distressd widow

Even in the afternoon of her best days

Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye

Seduced the pitch and height of his degree

To base declension and loathed bigamy

By her in his unlawful bed he got

This Edward whom our manners call the Prince

More bitterly could I expostulate

Save that for reverence to some alive

I give a sparing limit to my tongue

Then good my lord take to your royal self

This proffered benefit of dignity

If not to bless us and the land withal

Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry

From the corruption of abusing times

Unto a lineal true-derivd course

Refuse not mighty lord this proffered love

If you refuse it as in love and zeal

Loath to depose the child your brother's son

As well we know your tenderness of heart

And gentle kind effeminate remorse

Which we have noted in you to your kindred

And equally indeed to all estates

Yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no

Your brother's son shall never reign our king

But we will plant some other in the throne

To the disgrace and downfall of your house

And in this resolution here we leave you

Come citizens Zounds I'll entreat no more

Then I salute you with this royal title

Long live Richard England's worthy king

Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned

Tomorrow then we will attend your Grace

And so most joyfully we take our leave

My gracious sovereign

Still live they and forever let them last

Say on my loving lord

Why so you are my thrice-renownd lord

True noble prince

Your Grace may do your pleasure

Give me some little breath some pause dear lord

Before I positively speak in this

I will resolve you herein presently

My lord I have considered in my mind

The late request that you did sound me in

I hear the news my lord

My lord I claim the gift my due by promise

For which your honor and your faith is pawned

Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables

Which you have promisd I shall possess

What says your Highness to my just request

My lord

My lord your promise for the earldom

My lord

I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind

Of what you promised me

Upon the stroke of ten

Why let it strike

Why then resolve me whether you will or no

And is it thus Repays he my deep service

With such contempt Made I him king for this

O let me think on Hastings and be gone

To Brecknock while my fearful head is on

Will not King Richard let me speak with him

Hastings and Edward's children Grey and Rivers

Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward

Vaughan and all that have miscarrid

By underhand corrupted foul injustice

If that your moody discontented souls

Do through the clouds behold this present hour

Even for revenge mock my destruction

This is All Souls' Day fellow is it not

Why then All Souls' Day is my body's doomsday

This is the day which in King Edward's time

I wished might fall on me when I was found

False to his children and his wife's allies

This is the day wherein I wished to fall

By the false faith of him whom most I trusted

This this All Souls' Day to my fearful soul

Is the determined respite of my wrongs

That high All-seer which I dallied with

Hath turned my feignd prayer on my head

And given in earnest what I begged in jest

Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men

To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms

Thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck

When he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow

Remember Margaret was a prophetess

Come lead me officers to the block of shame

Wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame

The first was I that helped thee to the crown

The last was I that felt thy tyranny

O in the battle think on Buckingham

And die in terror of thy guiltiness

Dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death

Fainting despair despairing yield thy breath

I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid

But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismayed

God and good angels fight on Richmond's side

And Richard fall in height of all his pride
