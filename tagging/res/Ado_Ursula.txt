


I know you well enough You are Signior

Antonio

I know you by the waggling of your head

You could never do him so ill-well unless you

were the very man Here's his dry hand up and

down You are he you are he

Come come do you think I do not know you

by your excellent wit Can virtue hide itself Go to

mum you are he Graces will appear and there's an

end

The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish

Cut with her golden oars the silver stream

And greedily devour the treacherous bait

So angle we for Beatrice who even now

Is couchd in the woodbine coverture

Fear you not my part of the dialogue

But are you sure

That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely

And did they bid you tell her of it madam

Why did you so Doth not the gentleman

Deserve as full as fortunate a bed

As ever Beatrice shall couch upon

Sure I think so

And therefore certainly it were not good

She knew his love lest she'll make sport at it

Sure sure such carping is not commendable

Yet tell her of it Hear what she will say

O do not do your cousin such a wrong

She cannot be so much without true judgment

Having so swift and excellent a wit

As she is prized to have as to refuse

So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick

I pray you be not angry with me madam

Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick

For shape for bearing argument and valor

Goes foremost in report through Italy

His excellence did earn it ere he had it

When are you married madam

She's limed I warrant you We have caught her madam

I will lady

Well

Madam withdraw The Prince the Count

Signior Benedick Don John and all the gallants of

the town are come to fetch you to church

Madam you must come to your uncle Yonder's

old coil at home It is proved my Lady Hero

hath been falsely accused the Prince and Claudio

mightily abused and Don John is the author of all

who is fled and gone Will you come presently
