


The young Dumaine a well-accomplished youth

Of all that virtue love for virtue loved

Most power to do most harm least knowing ill

For he hath wit to make an ill shape good

And shape to win grace though he had no wit

I saw him at the Duke Alanson's once

And much too little of that good I saw

Is my report to his great worthiness

Two hot sheeps marry

You sheep and I pasture Shall that finish the jest

Not so gentle beast

My lips are no common though several they be

To my fortunes and me

He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him

Ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too

He made her melancholy sad and heavy

And so she died Had she been light like you

Of such a merry nimble stirring spirit

She might ha' been a grandam ere she died

And so may you for a light heart lives long

A light condition in a beauty dark

You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff

Therefore I'll darkly end the argument

So do not you for you are a light wench

You weigh me not O that's you care not for me

Fair as a text B in a copybook

Madam this glove

Yes madam and moreover

Some thousand verses of a faithful lover

A huge translation of hypocrisy

Vilely compiled profound simplicity

But in this changing what is your intent

What was your vizard made without a tongue

O for your reason Quickly sir I long

Veal quoth the Dutchman Is not veal a calf

No a fair Lord Calf

No I'll not be your half

Take all and wean it It may prove an ox

Then die a calf before your horns do grow

Bleat softly then The butcher hears you cry

Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart

And trow you what he called me

Yes in good faith

And Longaville was for my service born

A beard fair health and honesty

With threefold love I wish you all these three

Not so my lord A twelvemonth and a day

I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say

Come when the King doth to my lady come

Then if I have much love I'll give you some

Yet swear not lest you be forsworn again
