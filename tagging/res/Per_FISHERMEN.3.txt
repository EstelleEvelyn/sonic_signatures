Faith master I am thinking of the

poor men that were cast away before us even now

Nay master said not I as much

when I saw the porpoise how he bounced and tumbled

They say they're half fish half flesh A plague

on them They ne'er come but I look to be washed

Master I marvel how the fishes live in the sea

But master if I had been the sexton

I would have been that day in the belfry

Because he should have swallowed

me too And when I had been in his belly I would

have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should

never have left till he cast bells steeple church and

parish up again But if the good King Simonides

were of my mind

We would purge the land of these

drones that rob the bee of her honey
