May hold together. On her frights and griefs,

Which never tender lady hath borne greater,

She is something before her time delivered.

A daughter, and a goodly babe,

Lusty and like to live. The Queen receives

Much comfort in ’t, says “My poor prisoner,

I am innocent as you.”

Most worthy madam,

Your honor and your goodness is so evident

That your free undertaking cannot miss

A thriving issue. There is no lady living

So meet for this great errand. Please your Ladyship

To visit the next room, I’ll presently

Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer,

Who but today hammered of this design,

But durst not tempt a minister of honor

Lest she should be denied.

Now be you blest for it!

I’ll to the Queen. Please you come something nearer.
