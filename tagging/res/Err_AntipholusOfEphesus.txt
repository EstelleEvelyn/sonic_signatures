Good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all

My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours

Say that I lingered with you at your shop

To see the making of her carcanet

And that tomorrow you will bring it home

But here's a villain that would face me down

He met me on the mart and that I beat him

And charged him with a thousand marks in gold

And that I did deny my wife and house

Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this

I think thou art an ass

You're sad Signior Balthasar Pray God our cheer

May answer my goodwill and your good welcome here

O Signior Balthasar either at flesh or fish

A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish

And welcome more common for that's nothing but words

Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest

But though my cates be mean take them in good part

Better cheer may you have but not with better heart

But soft My door is locked Go bid them let us in

Who talks within there Ho open the door

Wherefore For my dinner I have not dined today

What art thou that keep'st me out from the house I owe

Do you hear you minion You'll let us in I hope

Thou baggage let me in

You'll cry for this minion if I beat the door down

Are you there wife You might have come before

There is something in the wind that we cannot get in

Go fetch me something I'll break ope the gate

Well I'll break in Go borrow me a crow

Go get thee gone Fetch me an iron crow

You have prevailed I will depart in quiet

And in despite of mirth mean to be merry

I know a wench of excellent discourse

Pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle

There will we dine This woman that I mean

My wifebut I protest without desert

Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal

To her will we to dinner Get you home

And fetch the chain by this I know 'tis made

Bring it I pray you to the Porpentine

For there's the house That chain will I bestow

Be it for nothing but to spite my wife

Upon mine hostess there Good sir make haste

Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me

I'll knock elsewhere to see if they'll disdain me

Do so This jest shall cost me some expense

While I go to the goldsmith's house go thou

And buy a rope's end That will I bestow

Among my wife and her confederates

For locking me out of my doors by day

But soft I see the goldsmith Get thee gone

Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me

A man is well holp up that trusts to you

I promisd your presence and the chain

But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me

Belike you thought our love would last too long

If it were chained together and therefore came not

I am not furnished with the present money

Besides I have some business in the town

Good signior take the stranger to my house

And with you take the chain and bid my wife

Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof

Perchance I will be there as soon as you

No bear it with you lest I come not time enough

An if I have not sir I hope you have

Or else you may return without your money

Good Lord You use this dalliance to excuse

Your breach of promise to the Porpentine

I should have chid you for not bringing it

But like a shrew you first begin to brawl

Why give it to my wife and fetch your money

Fie now you run this humor out of breath

Come where's the chain I pray you let me see it

I answer you What should I answer you

I owe you none till I receive the chain

You gave me none You wrong me much to say so

Consent to pay thee that I never had

Arrest me foolish fellow if thou dar'st

I do obey thee till I give thee bail

But sirrah you shall buy this sport as dear

As all the metal in your shop will answer

How now A madman Why thou peevish sheep

What ship of Epidamium stays for me

Thou drunken slave I sent thee for a rope

And told thee to what purpose and what end

I will debate this matter at more leisure

And teach your ears to list me with more heed

To Adriana villain hie thee straight

Give her this key and tell her in the desk

That's covered o'er with Turkish tapestry

There is a purse of ducats Let her send it

Tell her I am arrested in the street

And that shall bail me Hie thee slave Begone

On officer to prison till it come

Fear me not man I will not break away

I'll give thee ere I leave thee so much money

To warrant thee as I am 'rested for

My wife is in a wayward mood today

And will not lightly trust the messenger

That I should be attached in Ephesus

I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her ears

Here comes my man I think he brings the money

How now sir Have you that I sent you for

But where's the money

Five hundred ducats villain for a rope

To what end did I bid thee hie thee home

And to that end sir I will welcome you

Thou whoreson senseless

villain

Thou art sensible in nothing

but blows and so is an ass

Come go along My wife is coming yonder

Wilt thou still talk

There is my hand and let it feel your ear

Peace doting wizard peace I am not mad

You minion you are these your customers

Did this companion with the saffron face

Revel and feast it at my house today

Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut

And I denied to enter in my house

Dined at home Thou villain what sayest thou

Were not my doors locked up and I shut out

And did not she herself revile me there

Did not her kitchen maid rail taunt and scorn me

And did not I in rage depart from thence

Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me

Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats

Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today

And why dost thou deny the bag of gold

Dissembling harlot thou art false in all

And art confederate with a damnd pack

To make a loathsome abject scorn of me

But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes

That would behold in me this shameful sport

What will you murder meThou jailer thou

I am thy prisoner Wilt thou suffer them

To make a rescue

O most unhappy strumpet

Out on thee villain Wherefore dost thou mad me

Justice most gracious duke O grant me justice

Even for the service that long since I did thee

When I bestrid thee in the wars and took

Deep scars to save thy life Even for the blood

That then I lost for thee now grant me justice

Justice sweet prince against that woman there

She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife

That hath abusd and dishonored me

Even in the strength and height of injury

Beyond imagination is the wrong

That she this day hath shameless thrown on me

This day great duke she shut the doors upon me

While she with harlots feasted in my house

My liege I am advisd what I say

Neither disturbed with the effect of wine

Nor heady-rash provoked with raging ire

Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad

This woman locked me out this day from dinner

That goldsmith there were he not packed with her

Could witness it for he was with me then

Who parted with me to go fetch a chain

Promising to bring it to the Porpentine

Where Balthasar and I did dine together

Our dinner done and he not coming thither

I went to seek him In the street I met him

And in his company that gentleman

There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down

That I this day of him received the chain

Which God He knows I saw not for the which

He did arrest me with an officer

I did obey and sent my peasant home

For certain ducats He with none returned

Then fairly I bespoke the officer

To go in person with me to my house

By th' way we met

My wife her sister and a rabble more

Of vile confederates Along with them

They brought one Pinch a hungry lean-faced villain

A mere anatomy a mountebank

A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller

A needy hollow-eyed sharp-looking wretch

A living dead man This pernicious slave

Forsooth took on him as a conjurer

And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse

And with no face as 'twere outfacing me

Cries out I was possessed Then all together

They fell upon me bound me bore me thence

And in a dark and dankish vault at home

There left me and my man both bound together

Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder

I gained my freedom and immediately

Ran hither to your Grace whom I beseech

To give me ample satisfaction

For these deep shames and great indignities

I never came within these abbey walls

Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me

I never saw the chain so help me heaven

And this is false you burden me withal

'Tis true my liege this ring I had of her

I never saw you in my life till now

Neither

I never saw my father in my life

The Duke and all that know me in the city

Can witness with me that it is not so

I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life

I came from Corinth my most gracious lord

Brought to this town by that most famous warrior

Duke Menaphon your most renownd uncle

No I say nay to that

And you sir for this chain arrested me

These ducats pawn I for my father here

There take it and much thanks for my good cheer

Dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embarked
