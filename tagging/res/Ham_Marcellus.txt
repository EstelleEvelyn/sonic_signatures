O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved you?

Holla, Barnardo.

Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy

And will not let belief take hold of him

Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.

Therefore I have entreated him along

With us to watch the minutes of this night,

That, if again this apparition come,

He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again.

Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.

Speak to it, Horatio.

It is offended.

’Tis gone and will not answer.

Is it not like the King?

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,

With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,

Why this same strict and most observant watch

So nightly toils the subject of the land,

And why such daily cast of brazen cannon

And foreign mart for implements of war,

Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task

Does not divide the Sunday from the week.

What might be toward that this sweaty haste

Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?

Who is ’t that can inform me?

Shall I strike it with my partisan?

’Tis gone.

We do it wrong, being so majestical,

To offer it the show of violence,

For it is as the air, invulnerable,

And our vain blows malicious mockery.

It faded on the crowing of the cock.

Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes

Wherein our Savior’s birth is celebrated,

This bird of dawning singeth all night long;

And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,

The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,

No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,

So hallowed and so gracious is that time.

Let’s do ’t, I pray, and I this morning know

Where we shall find him most convenient.

My good lord.

My lord, upon the platform where we watch.

We do, my lord.

Armed, my lord.

My lord, from head to foot.

Longer, longer.

Our duty to your Honor.

No, it is struck.

Look with what courteous action

It waves you to a more removèd ground.

But do not go with it.

You shall not go, my lord.

Let’s follow. ’Tis not fit thus to obey him.

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

Nay, let’s follow him.

Lord Hamlet.

Illo, ho, ho, my lord!

How is ’t, my noble lord?

Nor I, my lord.

 Ay, by heaven, my lord.

 My lord, we will not.

Nor I, my lord, in faith.

We have sworn, my lord, already.
