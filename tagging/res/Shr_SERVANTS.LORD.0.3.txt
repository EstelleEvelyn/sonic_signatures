O, this it is that makes your lady mourn.

Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,

Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,

And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,

So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

Why, sir, you know no house, nor no such maid,

Nor no such men as you have reckoned up,

As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greete,

And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell,

And twenty more such names and men as these,

Which never were, nor no man ever saw.

Amen.
