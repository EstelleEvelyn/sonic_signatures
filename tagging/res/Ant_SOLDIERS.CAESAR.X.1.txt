
Enobarbus, Antony

Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with

His bounty overplus. The messenger

Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now

Unloading of his mules.

Mock not, Enobarbus.

I tell you true. Best you safed the bringer

Out of the host. I must attend mine office

Or would have done ’t myself. Your emperor

Continues still a Jove.
