Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones,

Ill-favoredly become the morning field.

Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,

And our air shakes them passing scornfully.

Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host

And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.

The horsemen sit like fixèd candlesticks

With torch staves in their hand, and their poor jades

Lob down their heads, drooping the hides and hips,

The gum down-roping from their pale dead eyes,

And in their pale dull mouths the gemeled bit

Lies foul with chawed grass, still and motionless.

And their executors, the knavish crows,

Fly o’er them all, impatient for their hour.

Description cannot suit itself in words

To demonstrate the life of such a battle

In life so lifeless, as it shows itself.
