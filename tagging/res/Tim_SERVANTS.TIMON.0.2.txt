
As we do turn our backs

From our companion thrown into his grave

So his familiars to his buried fortunes

Slink all away leave their false vows with him

Like empty purses picked and his poor self

A dedicated beggar to the air

With his disease of all-shunned poverty

Walks like contempt alone    More of our fellows
