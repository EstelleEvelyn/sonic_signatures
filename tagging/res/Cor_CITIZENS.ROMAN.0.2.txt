Resolved resolved

We know 't we know 't

No more talking on 't let it be done Away away

One word good citizens

Would you proceed especially against

Caius Martius

Against him first He's a very dog to the

commonalty

Consider you what services he has

done for his country

Nay but speak not maliciously

What he cannot help in his nature you

account a vice in him You must in no way say he

is covetous

Come come

Worthy Menenius Agrippa one that

hath always loved the people

Our business is not unknown to th'

Senate They have had inkling this fortnight what

we intend to do which now we'll show 'em in

deeds They say poor suitors have strong breaths

they shall know we have strong arms too

We cannot sir we are undone already

Care for us True indeed They ne'er

cared for us yet Suffer us to famish and their

storehouses crammed with grain make edicts for

usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome

act established against the rich and provide

more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain

the poor If the wars eat us not up they will

and there's all the love they bear us

Well I'll hear it sir yet you must not

think to fob off our disgrace with a tale But an 't

please you deliver

Well sir what answer made the belly

Your belly's answerwhat

The kingly crownd head the vigilant eye

The counselor heart the arm our soldier

Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter

With other muniments and petty helps

In this our fabric if that they

Should by the cormorant belly be restrained

Who is the sink o' th' body

The former agents if they did complain

What could the belly answer

You're long about it

Ay sir well well

It was an answer How apply you this

I the great toe Why the great toe

We have ever your good word

Down with him down with him

Let's hear our tribune Peace Speak speak speak

True

The people are the city

You so remain

Yield Martius yield

Down with him down with him

He shall sure on 't

No no no no no

To th' rock to th' rock with him

It shall be so it shall be so Let him away

He's banished and it shall be so

It shall be so it shall be so

Our enemy is banished he is gone Hoo hoo

Come come let's see him out at gates Come

The gods preserve our noble tribunes Come

The gods preserve you both

Now the gods keep you

Faith we hear fearful news

And so did I

So did we all But come let's home
