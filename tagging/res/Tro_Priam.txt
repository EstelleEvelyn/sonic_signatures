Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:

“Deliver Helen, and all damage else—

As honor, loss of time, travel, expense,

Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed

In hot digestion of this cormorant war—

Shall be struck off.”—Hector, what say you to ’t?

What noise? What shriek is this?

Paris, you speak

Like one besotted on your sweet delights.

You have the honey still, but these the gall.

So to be valiant is no praise at all.

Come, Hector, come. Go back.

Thy wife hath dreamt, thy mother hath had visions,

Cassandra doth foresee, and I myself

Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt

To tell thee that this day is ominous.

Therefore, come back.

Ay, but thou shalt not go.

Farewell. The gods with safety stand about thee!
