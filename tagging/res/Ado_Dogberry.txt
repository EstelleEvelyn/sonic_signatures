Nay, that were a punishment too good for

them if they should have any allegiance in them,

being chosen for the Prince’s watch.

First, who think you the most desartless

man to be constable?

Come hither, neighbor Seacoal.

God hath blessed you with a good

name. To be a well-favored man is the gift of

fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.

You have. I knew it would be your answer.

Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and

make no boast of it, and for your writing and

reading, let that appear when there is no need of

such vanity. You are thought here to be the most

senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch;

therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge:

you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to

bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.

Why, then, take no note of him, but let him

go, and presently call the rest of the watch together

and thank God you are rid of a knave.

True, and they are to meddle with none but

the Prince’s subjects.—You shall also make no

noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and

to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.

Why, you speak like an ancient and most

quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping

should offend; only have a care that your bills be not

stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and

bid those that are drunk get them to bed.

Why then, let them alone till they are sober.

If they make you not then the better answer, you

may say they are not the men you took them for.

If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by

virtue of your office, to be no true man, and for such

kind of men, the less you meddle or make with

them, why, the more is for your honesty.

Truly, by your office you may, but I think

they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most

peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to

let him show himself what he is and steal out of

your company.

Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will,

much more a man who hath any honesty in him.

Why, then depart in peace, and let the

child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will

not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a

calf when he bleats.

This is the end of the charge. You, constable,

are to present the Prince’s own person. If you

meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.

Five shillings to one on ’t, with any man that

knows the statutes, he may stay him—marry, not

without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch

ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a

man against his will.

Ha, ah ha!—Well, masters, goodnight. An

there be any matter of weight chances, call up me.

Keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and

goodnight.—Come, neighbor.

One word more, honest neighbors. I pray

you watch about Signior Leonato’s door, for the

wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil

tonight. Adieu, be vigitant, I beseech you.

Masters, masters—

Masters, never

speak, we charge you, let us obey you to go with us.

Marry, sir, I would have some confidence

with you that decerns you nearly.

Marry, this it is, sir.

Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the

matter. An old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt

as, God help, I would desire they were, but, in faith,

honest as the skin between his brows.

Comparisons are odorous. Palabras, neighbor

Verges.

It pleases your Worship to say so, but we

are the poor duke’s officers. But truly, for mine

own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find

in my heart to bestow it all of your Worship.

Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more

than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your

Worship as of any man in the city, and though I be

but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.

A good old man, sir. He will be talking. As

they say, “When the age is in, the wit is out.” God

help us, it is a world to see!—Well said, i’ faith,

neighbor Verges.—Well, God’s a good man. An two

men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An

honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever

broke bread, but God is to be worshiped, all men

are not alike, alas, good neighbor.

Gifts that God gives.

One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed

comprehended two aspicious persons, and we

would have them this morning examined before

your Worship.

It shall be suffigance.

Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis

Seacoal. Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the

jail. We are now to examination these men.

We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.

Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome.

Only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication

and meet me at the jail.

Is our whole dissembly appeared?

Marry, that am I, and my partner.

Yea, marry, let them come before me.

What is your name, friend?

Pray, write down “Borachio.”—Yours,

sirrah?

Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—

Masters, do you serve God?

Write down that they hope they serve

God; and write God first, for God defend but God

should go before such villains!—Masters, it is

proved already that you are little better than false

knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly.

How answer you for yourselves?

A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you,

but I will go about with him.—Come you hither,

sirrah, a word in your ear. Sir, I say to you it is

thought you are false knaves.

Well, stand aside.—’Fore God, they are

both in a tale. Have you writ down that they are

none?

Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way.—Let

the watch come forth. Masters, I charge you in the

Prince’s name, accuse these men.

Write down Prince John a villain. Why,

this is flat perjury, to call a prince’s brother villain!

Pray thee, fellow, peace. I do not like thy

look, I promise thee.

Flat burglary as ever was committed.

O, villain! Thou wilt be condemned

into everlasting redemption for this!

Come, let them be opinioned.

God’s my life, where’s the Sexton? Let

him write down the Prince’s officer “coxcomb.”

Come, bind them.—Thou naughty varlet!

Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost

thou not suspect my years? O, that he were here to

write me down an ass! But masters, remember that

I am an ass, though it be not written down, yet

forget not that I am an ass.—No, thou villain, thou

art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by

good witness. I am a wise fellow and, which is more,

an officer and, which is more, a householder and,

which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in

Messina, and one that knows the law, go to, and a

rich fellow enough, go to, and a fellow that hath had

losses, and one that hath two gowns and everything

handsome about him.—Bring him away.—O, that I

had been writ down an ass!

Come you, sir. If justice cannot tame you,

she shall ne’er weigh more reasons in her balance.

Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must

be looked to.

Marry, sir, they have committed false

report; moreover, they have spoken untruths;

secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they

have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust

things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.

Come, bring away the plaintiffs. By this

time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of

the matter. And, masters, do not forget to specify,

when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.

Moreover, sir, which indeed is

not under white and black, this plaintiff here, the

offender, did call me ass. I beseech you, let it be

remembered in his punishment. And also the watch

heard them talk of one Deformed. They say he

wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and

borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath

used so long and never paid that now men grow

hardhearted and will lend nothing for God’s sake.

Pray you, examine him upon that point.

Your Worship speaks like a most thankful

and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.

God save the foundation.

I leave an arrant knave with your Worship,

which I beseech your Worship to correct

yourself, for the example of others. God keep your

Worship! I wish your Worship well. God restore you

to health. I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a

merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it.—

Come, neighbor.
