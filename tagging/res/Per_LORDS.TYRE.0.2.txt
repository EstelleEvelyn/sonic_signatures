


And keep your mind till you return to us

Peaceful and comfortable

It shall no longer grieve without reproof

Whose death's indeed the strongest in our censure

And knowing this kingdom is without a head

Like goodly buildings left without a roof

Soon fall to ruinyour noble self

That best know how to rule and how to reign

We thus submit unto our sovereign

Live noble Helicane
