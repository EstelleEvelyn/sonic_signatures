
Most royal Majesty

I crave no more than hath your Highness offered

Nor will you tender less

I know no answer

Pardon me royal sir

Election makes not up in such conditions

Royal king

Give but that portion which yourself proposed

And here I take Cordelia by the hand

Duchess of Burgundy

I am sorry then you have so lost a father

That you must lose a husband
