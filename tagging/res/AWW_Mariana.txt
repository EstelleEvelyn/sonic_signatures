Come let's return again and suffice ourselves

with the report of itWell Diana take heed of

this French earl The honor of a maid is her name

and no legacy is so rich as honesty

I know that knave hang him One Parolles a

filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the

young earlBeware of them Diana Their promises

enticements oaths tokens and all these

engines of lust are not the things they go under

Many a maid hath been seduced by them and

the misery is example that so terrible shows in the

wrack of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade

succession but that they are limed with the twigs

that threatens them I hope I need not to advise

you further but I hope your own grace will keep

you where you are though there were no further

danger known but the modesty which is so lost

The gods forbid else

He's shrewdly vexed at something Look he

has spied us

And your courtesy for a

ring-carrier
