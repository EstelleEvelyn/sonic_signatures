
This is most strange

That she whom even but now was your best object

The argument of your praise balm of your age

The best the dearest should in this trice of time

Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle

So many folds of favor Sure her offense

Must be of such unnatural degree

That monsters it or your forevouched affection

Fall into taint which to believe of her

Must be a faith that reason without miracle

Should never plant in me

Is it but thisa tardiness in nature

Which often leaves the history unspoke

That it intends to doMy lord of Burgundy

What say you to the lady Love's not love

When it is mingled with regards that stands

Aloof from th' entire point Will you have her

She is herself a dowry

Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor

Most choice forsaken and most loved despised

Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon

Be it lawful I take up what's cast away

Gods gods 'Tis strange that from their cold'st neglect

My love should kindle to enflamed respect

Thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance

Is queen of us of ours and our fair France

Not all the dukes of wat'rish Burgundy

Can buy this unprized precious maid of me

Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind

Thou losest here a better where to find

Bid farewell to your sisters

Come my fair Cordelia
