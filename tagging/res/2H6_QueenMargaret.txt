


Great king of England and my gracious lord,

The mutual conference that my mind hath had

By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,

In courtly company or at my beads,

With you, mine alderliefest sovereign,

Makes me the bolder to salute my king

With ruder terms, such as my wit affords

And overjoy of heart doth minister.

We thank you all.

To my

Lord Protector. Are your supplications to his Lordship?

Let me see them.—What is thine?

What sayst thou? Did the Duke of

York say he was rightful heir to the crown?

And as for you that love to be protected

Under the wings of our Protector’s grace,

Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.

Away, base cullions.—Suffolk, let them go.

My lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,

Is this the fashions in the court of England?

Is this the government of Britain’s isle

And this the royalty of Albion’s king?

What, shall King Henry be a pupil still

Under the surly Gloucester’s governance?

Am I a queen in title and in style,

And must be made a subject to a duke?

I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours

Thou rann’st atilt in honor of my love

And stol’st away the ladies’ hearts of France,

I thought King Henry had resembled thee

In courage, courtship, and proportion.

But all his mind is bent to holiness,

To number Ave Marys on his beads;

His champions are the prophets and apostles,

His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,

His study is his tiltyard, and his loves

Are brazen images of canonized saints.

I would the College of the Cardinals

Would choose him pope and carry him to Rome

And set the triple crown upon his head!

That were a state fit for his holiness.

Besides the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort

The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,

And grumbling York; and not the least of these

But can do more in England than the King.

Not all these lords do vex me half so much

As that proud dame, the Lord Protector’s wife.

She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,

More like an empress than Duke Humphrey’s wife.

Strangers in court do take her for the Queen.

She bears a duke’s revenues on her back,

And in her heart she scorns our poverty.

Shall I not live to be avenged on her?

Contemptuous baseborn callet as she is,

She vaunted ’mongst her minions t’ other day

The very train of her worst wearing gown

Was better worth than all my father’s lands

Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.

Because the King, forsooth, will have it so.

If he be old enough, what needs your Grace

To be Protector of his Excellence?

Thy sale of offices and towns in France,

If they were known, as the suspect is great,

Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.

Give me my fan. What, minion, can you not?

I cry you mercy, madam. Was it you?

Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook

I saw not better sport these seven years’ day.

Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high,

And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.

And thy ambition, Gloucester.

Tell me, good fellow, cam’st thou here by chance,

Or of devotion to this holy shrine?

It made me laugh to see the villain run.

Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,

And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.

I see no reason why a king of years

Should be to be protected like a child.

God and King Henry govern England’s realm!—

Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.

Why, now is Henry king and Margaret queen,

And Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, scarce himself,

That bears so shrewd a maim. Two pulls at once:

His lady banished and a limb lopped off.

This staff of honor raught, there let it stand

Where it best fits to be, in Henry’s hand.

Ay, good my lord, for purposely therefor

Left I the court to see this quarrel tried.

Can you not see, or will you not observe,

The strangeness of his altered countenance?

With what a majesty he bears himself,

How insolent of late he is become,

How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?

We know the time since he was mild and affable;

And if we did but glance a far-off look,

Immediately he was upon his knee,

That all the court admired him for submission.

But meet him now, and, be it in the morn

When everyone will give the time of day,

He knits his brow and shows an angry eye

And passeth by with stiff unbowèd knee,

Disdaining duty that to us belongs.

Small curs are not regarded when they grin,

But great men tremble when the lion roars—

And Humphrey is no little man in England.

First, note that he is near you in descent,

And, should you fall, he is the next will mount.

Meseemeth then it is no policy,

Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears

And his advantage following your decease,

That he should come about your royal person

Or be admitted to your Highness’ Council.

By flattery hath he won the Commons’ hearts;

And when he please to make commotion,

’Tis to be feared they all will follow him.

Now ’tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;

Suffer them now, and they’ll o’ergrow the garden

And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.

The reverent care I bear unto my lord

Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.

If it be fond, call it a woman’s fear,

Which fear, if better reasons can supplant,

I will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke.

My lords of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,

Reprove my allegation if you can,

Or else conclude my words effectual.

Ah, what’s more dangerous than this fond affiance?

Seems he a dove? His feathers are but borrowed,

For he’s disposèd as the hateful raven.

Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,

For he’s inclined as is the ravenous wolves.

Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?

Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all

Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.

But I can give the loser leave to chide.

What, will your Highness leave the Parliament?

Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun’s hot beams.

Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,

Too full of foolish pity; and Gloucester’s show

Beguiles him, as the mournful crocodile

With sorrow snares relenting passengers,

Or as the snake, rolled in a flow’ring bank,

With shining checkered slough, doth sting a child

That for the beauty thinks it excellent.

Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I—

And yet herein I judge mine own wit good—

This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,

To rid us from the fear we have of him.

So the poor chicken should be sure of death.

Thrice noble Suffolk, ’tis resolutely spoke.

And so say I.

Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire

If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with.—

No more, good York.—Sweet Somerset, be still.—

Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,

Might happily have proved far worse than his.

God forbid any malice should prevail

That faultless may condemn a nobleman!

Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!

Marry, God forfend!

How fares my lord? Help, lords, the King is dead!

Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!

How fares my gracious lord?

Why do you rate my lord of Suffolk thus?

Although the Duke was enemy to him,

Yet he most Christian-like laments his death.

And for myself, foe as he was to me,

Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans

Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,

I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,

Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,

And all to have the noble duke alive.

What know I how the world may deem of me?

For it is known we were but hollow friends.

It may be judged I made the Duke away;

So shall my name with slander’s tongue be wounded

And princes’ courts be filled with my reproach.

This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy,

To be a queen and crowned with infamy!

Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.

What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?

I am no loathsome leper. Look on me.

What, art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?

Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn queen.

Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester’s tomb?

Why, then, Dame Margaret was ne’er thy joy.

Erect his statue and worship it,

And make my image but an alehouse sign.

Was I for this nigh-wracked upon the sea

And twice by awkward wind from England’s bank

Drove back again unto my native clime?

What boded this, but well forewarning wind

Did seem to say “Seek not a scorpion’s nest,

Nor set no footing on this unkind shore”?

What did I then but cursed the gentle gusts

And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves

And bid them blow towards England’s blessèd shore

Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?

Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,

But left that hateful office unto thee.

The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,

Knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore

With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness.

The splitting rocks cow’red in the sinking sands

And would not dash me with their ragged sides

Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,

Might in thy palace perish Margaret.

As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,

When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,

I stood upon the hatches in the storm,

And when the dusky sky began to rob

My earnest-gaping sight of thy land’s view,

I took a costly jewel from my neck—

A heart it was, bound in with diamonds—

And threw it towards thy land. The sea received it,

And so I wished thy body might my heart.

And even with this I lost fair England’s view,

And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,

And called them blind and dusky spectacles

For losing ken of Albion’s wishèd coast.

How often have I tempted Suffolk’s tongue,

The agent of thy foul inconstancy,

To sit and watch me, as Ascanius did

When he to madding Dido would unfold

His father’s acts commenced in burning Troy!

Am I not witched like her, or thou not false like him?

Ay me, I can no more. Die, Margaret,

For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen

As guilty of Duke Humphrey’s timeless death.

Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where’s your knife?

Is Beaufort termed a kite? Where are his talons?

He dares not calm his contumelious spirit

Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,

Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.

What noise is this?

O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!

Mischance and sorrow go along with you!

Heart’s discontent and sour affliction

Be playfellows to keep you company!

There’s two of you; the devil make a third,

And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!

Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!

Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemies?

Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment’st thyself,

And these dread curses, like the sun ’gainst glass,

Or like an over-chargèd gun, recoil

And turn the force of them upon thyself.

O, let me entreat thee cease! Give me thy hand,

That I may dew it with my mournful tears;

Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place

To wash away my woeful monuments.

O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,

That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,

Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!

So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;

’Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,

As one that surfeits thinking on a want.

I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,

Adventure to be banishèd myself;

And banishèd I am, if but from thee.

Go, speak not to me. Even now be gone!

O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemned

Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,

Loather a hundred times to part than die.

Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee.

Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithee?

Go, tell this heavy message to the King.

Ay me! What is this world? What news are these!

But wherefore grieve I at an hour’s poor loss,

Omitting Suffolk’s exile, my soul’s treasure?

Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,

And with the southern clouds contend in tears—

Theirs for the earth’s increase, mine for my sorrows’?

Now get thee hence. The King, thou know’st, is coming;

If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.

Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,

It is applièd to a deathful wound.

To France, sweet Suffolk. Let me hear from thee,

For wheresoe’er thou art in this world’s globe,

I’ll have an Iris that shall find thee out.

And take my heart with thee.

This way for me.

Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind

And makes it fearful and degenerate.

Think therefore on revenge, and cease to weep.

But who can cease to weep and look on this?

Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast,

But where’s the body that I should embrace?

Ah, barbarous villains! Hath this lovely face

Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,

And could it not enforce them to relent

That were unworthy to behold the same?

No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.

Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,

These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!

My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.

For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,

But boldly stand and front him to his face.

Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain,

To say if that the bastard boys of York

Shall be the surety for their traitor father.

And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.

He is arrested, but will not obey.

His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.

A subtle traitor needs no sophister.

Away, my lord! You are slow. For shame, away!

What are you made of? You’ll nor fight nor fly.

Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defense

To give the enemy way, and to secure us

By what we can, which can no more but fly.

If you be ta’en, we then should see the bottom

Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape,

As well we may—if not through your neglect—

We shall to London get, where you are loved

And where this breach now in our fortunes made

May readily be stopped.
