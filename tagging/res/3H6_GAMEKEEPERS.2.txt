


I'll stay above the hill so both may shoot

Here comes a man let's stay till he be past

Why linger we Let us lay hands upon him

Say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens

Ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king

But if thou be a king where is thy crown

Well if you be a king crowned with content

Your crown content and you must be contented

To go along with us For as we think

You are the king King Edward hath deposed

And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance

Will apprehend you as his enemy

No never such an oath nor will not now

Here in this country where we now remain
