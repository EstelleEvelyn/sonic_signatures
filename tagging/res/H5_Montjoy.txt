


You know me by my habit

My master's mind

Thus says my king Say thou to Harry of

England though we seemed dead we did but sleep

Advantage is a better soldier than rashness Tell him

we could have rebuked him at Harfleur but that we

thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full

ripe Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is

imperial England shall repent his folly see his

weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him

therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion

the losses we have borne the subjects we

have lost the disgrace we have digested which in

weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under

For our losses his exchequer is too poor for th'

effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom

too faint a number and for our disgrace his own

person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless

satisfaction To this add defiance and tell him

for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers

whose condemnation is pronounced So far my

king and master so much my office

Montjoy

I shall deliver so Thanks to your Highness

Once more I come to know of thee King Harry

If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound

Before thy most assurd overthrow

For certainly thou art so near the gulf

Thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy

The Constable desires thee thou wilt mind

Thy followers of repentance that their souls

May make a peaceful and a sweet retire

From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies

Must lie and fester

The Constable of France

I shall King Harry And so fare thee well

Thou never shalt hear herald anymore

No great king

I come to thee for charitable license

That we may wander o'er this bloody field

To book our dead and then to bury them

To sort our nobles from our common men

For many of our princeswoe the while

Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood

So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs

In blood of princes and the wounded steeds

Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage

Yerk out their armd heels at their dead masters

Killing them twice O give us leave great king

To view the field in safety and dispose

Of their dead bodies

The day is yours

They call it Agincourt
