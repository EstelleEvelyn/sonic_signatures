


Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman

The King reposeth all his confidence in thee

Ah Richard With the eyes of heavy mind

I see thy glory like a shooting star

Fall to the base earth from the firmament

Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west

Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest

Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes

And crossly to thy good all fortune goes

Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord

Than this weak arm Discomfort guides my tongue

And bids me speak of nothing but despair

One day too late I fear me noble lord

Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth

O call back yesterday bid time return

And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men

Today today unhappy day too late

Overthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state

For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead

Are gone to Bolingbroke dispersed and fled
