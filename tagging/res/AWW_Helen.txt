


I do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it too

O were that all I think not on my father

And these great tears grace his remembrance more

Than those I shed for him What was he like

I have forgot him My imagination

Carries no favor in 't but Bertram's

I am undone There is no living none

If Bertram be away 'Twere all one

That I should love a bright particular star

And think to wed it he is so above me

In his bright radiance and collateral light

Must I be comforted not in his sphere

Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself

The hind that would be mated by the lion

Must die for love 'Twas pretty though a plague

To see him every hour to sit and draw

His archd brows his hawking eye his curls

In our heart's tableheart too capable

Of every line and trick of his sweet favor

But now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy

Must sanctify his relics Who comes here

One that goes with him I love him for his sake

And yet I know him a notorious liar

Think him a great way fool solely a coward

Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him

That they take place when virtue's steely bones

Looks bleak i' th' cold wind Withal full oft we see

Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly

And you monarch

And no

Ay You have some stain of soldier in you let

me ask you a question Man is enemy to virginity

How may we barricado it against him

But he assails and our virginity though

valiant in the defense yet is weak Unfold to us

some warlike resistance

Bless our poor virginity from underminers and

blowers-up Is there no military policy how virgins

might blow up men

I will stand for 't a little though therefore I

die a virgin

How might one do sir to lose it to her own

liking

Not my virginity yet

There shall your master have a thousand loves

A mother and a mistress and a friend

A phoenix captain and an enemy

A guide a goddess and a sovereign

A counselor a traitress and a dear

His humble ambition proud humility

His jarring concord and his discord dulcet

His faith his sweet disaster with a world

Of pretty fond adoptious christendoms

That blinking Cupid gossips Now shall he

I know not what he shall God send him well

The court's a learning place and he is one

That I wish well 'Tis pity

That wishing well had not a body in 't

Which might be felt that we the poorer born

Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes

Might with effects of them follow our friends

And show what we alone must think which never

Returns us thanks

Monsieur Parolles you were born under a

charitable star

I especially think under Mars

The wars hath so kept you under that you

must needs be born under Mars

When he was retrograde I think rather

You go so much backward when you fight

So is running away when fear proposes the

safety But the composition that your valor and

fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and I

like the wear well

Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie

Which we ascribe to heaven The fated sky

Gives us free scope only doth backward pull

Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull

What power is it which mounts my love so high

That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye

The mightiest space in fortune nature brings

To join like likes and kiss like native things

Impossible be strange attempts to those

That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose

What hath been cannot be Who ever strove

To show her merit that did miss her love

The King's diseasemy project may deceive me

But my intents are fixed and will not leave me

What is your pleasure madam

Mine honorable mistress

That I am not

Pardon madam

The Count Rossillion cannot be my brother

I am from humble he from honored name

No note upon my parents his all noble

My master my dear lord he is and I

His servant live and will his vassal die

He must not be my brother

You are my mother madam Would you were

So that my lord your son were not my brother

Indeed my mother Or were you both our mothers

I care no more for than I do for heaven

So I were not his sister Can 't no other

But I your daughter he must be my brother

Good madam pardon me

Your pardon noble mistress

Do not you love him madam

Then I confess

Here on my knee before high heaven and you

That before you and next unto high heaven

I love your son

My friends were poor but honest so 's my love

Be not offended for it hurts not him

That he is loved of me I follow him not

By any token of presumptuous suit

Nor would I have him till I do deserve him

Yet never know how that desert should be

I know I love in vain strive against hope

Yet in this captious and intenible sieve

I still pour in the waters of my love

And lack not to lose still Thus Indian-like

Religious in mine error I adore

The sun that looks upon his worshipper

But knows of him no more My dearest madam

Let not your hate encounter with my love

For loving where you do but if yourself

Whose agd honor cites a virtuous youth

Did ever in so true a flame of liking

Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian

Was both herself and Love O then give pity

To her whose state is such that cannot choose

But lend and give where she is sure to lose

That seeks not to find that her search implies

But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies

Madam I had

I will tell truth by grace itself I swear

You know my father left me some prescriptions

Of rare and proved effects such as his reading

And manifest experience had collected

For general sovereignty and that he willed me

In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them

As notes whose faculties inclusive were

More than they were in note Amongst the rest

There is a remedy approved set down

To cure the desperate languishings whereof

The King is rendered lost

My lord your son made me to think of this

Else Paris and the medicine and the King

Had from the conversation of my thoughts

Haply been absent then

There's something in 't

More than my father's skill which was the great'st

Of his profession that his good receipt

Shall for my legacy be sanctified

By th' luckiest stars in heaven and would your Honor

But give me leave to try success I'd venture

The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure

By such a day an hour

Ay madam knowingly

Ay my good lord

Gerard de Narbon was my father

In what he did profess well found

The rather will I spare my praises towards him

Knowing him is enough On 's bed of death

Many receipts he gave me chiefly one

Which as the dearest issue of his practice

And of his old experience th' only darling

He bade me store up as a triple eye

Safer than mine own two more dear I have so

And hearing your high Majesty is touched

With that malignant cause wherein the honor

Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power

I come to tender it and my appliance

With all bound humbleness

My duty then shall pay me for my pains

I will no more enforce mine office on you

Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts

A modest one to bear me back again

What I can do can do no hurt to try

Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy

He that of greatest works is finisher

Oft does them by the weakest minister

So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown

When judges have been babes Great floods have flown

From simple sources and great seas have dried

When miracles have by the great'st been denied

Oft expectation fails and most oft there

Where most it promises and oft it hits

Where hope is coldest and despair most shifts

Inspird merit so by breath is barred

It is not so with Him that all things knows

As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows

But most it is presumption in us when

The help of heaven we count the act of men

Dear sir to my endeavors give consent

Of heaven not me make an experiment

I am not an impostor that proclaim

Myself against the level of mine aim

But know I think and think I know most sure

My art is not past power nor you past cure

The greatest grace lending grace

Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring

Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring

Ere twice in murk and occidental damp

Moist Hesperus hath quenched her sleepy lamp

Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass

Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass

What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly

Health shall live free and sickness freely die

Tax of impudence

A strumpet's boldness a divulgd shame

Traduced by odious ballads my maiden's name

Seared otherwise nay worse of worst extended

With vilest torture let my life be ended

If I break time or flinch in property

Of what I spoke unpitied let me die

And well deserved Not helping death's my fee

But if I help what do you promise me

But will you make it even

Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand

What husband in thy power I will command

Exempted be from me the arrogance

To choose from forth the royal blood of France

My low and humble name to propagate

With any branch or image of thy state

But such a one thy vassal whom I know

Is free for me to ask thee to bestow

To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress

Fall when Love please Marry to each but one

Gentlemen

Heaven hath through me restored the King to health

I am a simple maid and therein wealthiest

That I protest I simply am a maid

Please it your Majesty I have done already

The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me

We blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused

Let the white death sit on thy cheek forever

We'll ne'er come there again

Now Dian from thy altar do I fly

And to imperial Love that god most high

Do my sighs stream Sir will you hear my suit

Thanks sir All the rest is mute

The honor sir that flames in your fair eyes

Before I speak too threat'ningly replies

Love make your fortunes twenty times above

Her that so wishes and her humble love

My wish receive

Which great Love grant and so I take my leave

Be not afraid that I your hand should take

I'll never do you wrong for your own sake

Blessing upon your vows and in your bed

Find fairer fortune if you ever wed

You are too young too happy and too good

To make yourself a son out of my blood

I dare not say I take you but I give

Me and my service ever whilst I live

Into your guiding powerThis is the man

That you are well restored my lord I'm glad

Let the rest go

My mother greets me kindly Is she well

If she be very well what does she ail that she's

not very well

What two things

I hope sir I have your good will to have mine

own good fortunes

What's his will else

What more commands he

In everything I wait upon his will

I pray you come sirrah

I have sir as I was commanded from you

Spoke with the King and have procured his leave

For present parting Only he desires

Some private speech with you

Sir I can nothing say

But that I am your most obedient servant

And ever shall

With true observance seek to eke out that

Wherein toward me my homely stars have failed

To equal my great fortune

Pray sir your pardon

I am not worthy of the wealth I owe

Nor dare I say 'tis mineand yet it is

But like a timorous thief most fain would steal

What law does vouch mine own

Something and scarce so much nothing indeed

I would not tell you what I would my lord Faith yes

Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss

I shall not break your bidding good my lord

Where are my other menMonsieur farewell

Madam my lord is gone forever gone

Look on his letter madam here's my passport

When thou canst get the ring upon

my finger which never shall come off and show me

a child begotten of thy body that I am father to then

call me husband But in such a then I write a

never

This is a dreadful sentence

Till I have no wife I have nothing in France

'Tis bitter

Ay madam

Till I have no wife I have nothing in France

Nothing in France until he has no wife

Thou shalt have none Rossillion none in France

Then hast thou all again Poor lord is 't I

That chase thee from thy country and expose

Those tender limbs of thine to the event

Of the none-sparing war And is it I

That drive thee from the sportive court where thou

Wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark

Of smoky muskets O you leaden messengers

That ride upon the violent speed of fire

Fly with false aim move the still-'pearing air

That sings with piercing do not touch my lord

Whoever shoots at him I set him there

Whoever charges on his forward breast

I am the caitiff that do hold him to 't

And though I kill him not I am the cause

His death was so effected Better 'twere

I met the ravin lion when he roared

With sharp constraint of hunger better 'twere

That all the miseries which nature owes

Were mine at once No come thou home Rossillion

Whence honor but of danger wins a scar

As oft it loses all I will be gone

My being here it is that holds thee hence

Shall I stay here to do 't No no although

The air of paradise did fan the house

And angels officed all I will be gone

That pitiful rumor may report my flight

To consolate thine ear Come night end day

For with the dark poor thief I'll steal away

To Saint Jaques le Grand

Where do the palmers lodge I do beseech you

Is this the way

Is it yourself

I thank you and will stay upon your leisure

I did so

His name I pray you

But by the ear that hears most nobly of him

His face I know not

Ay surely mere the truth I know his lady

What's his name

O I believe with him

In argument of praise or to the worth

Of the great count himself she is too mean

To have her name repeated All her deserving

Is a reservd honesty and that

I have not heard examined

How do you mean

Maybe the amorous count solicits her

In the unlawful purpose

Which is the Frenchman

I like him well

Which is he

Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle

I humbly thank you

Please it this matron and this gentle maid

To eat with us tonight the charge and thanking

Shall be for me And to requite you further

I will bestow some precepts of this virgin

Worthy the note

If you misdoubt me that I am not she

I know not how I shall assure you further

But I shall lose the grounds I work upon

Nor would I wish you

First give me trust the Count he is my husband

And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken

Is so from word to word and then you cannot

By the good aid that I of you shall borrow

Err in bestowing it

Take this purse of gold

And let me buy your friendly help thus far

Which I will overpay and pay again

When I have found it The Count he woos your daughter

Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty

Resolved to carry her Let her in fine consent

As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it

Now his important blood will naught deny

That she'll demand A ring the County wears

That downward hath succeeded in his house

From son to son some four or five descents

Since the first father wore it This ring he holds

In most rich choice Yet in his idle fire

To buy his will it would not seem too dear

Howe'er repented after

You see it lawful then It is no more

But that your daughter ere she seems as won

Desires this ring appoints him an encounter

In fine delivers me to fill the time

Herself most chastely absent After

To marry her I'll add three thousand crowns

To what is passed already

Why then tonight

Let us assay our plot which if it speed

Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed

And lawful meaning in a lawful act

Where both not sin and yet a sinful fact

But let's about it

That you may well perceive I have not wronged you

One of the greatest in the Christian world

Shall be my surety 'fore whose throne 'tis needful

Ere I can perfect mine intents to kneel

Time was I did him a desird office

Dear almost as his life which gratitude

Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth

And answer thanks I duly am informed

His Grace is at Marseilles to which place

We have convenient convoy You must know

I am supposd dead The army breaking

My husband hies him home where heaven aiding

And by the leave of my good lord the King

We'll be before our welcome

Nor you mistress

Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor

To recompense your love Doubt not but heaven

Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower

As it hath fated her to be my motive

And helper to a husband But O strange men

That can such sweet use make of what they hate

When saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts

Defiles the pitchy night So lust doth play

With what it loathes for that which is away

But more of this hereafterYou Diana

Under my poor instructions yet must suffer

Something in my behalf

Yet I pray you

But with the word The time will bring on summer

When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns

And be as sweet as sharp We must away

Our wagon is prepared and time revives us

All's well that ends well Still the fine's the crown

Whate'er the course the end is the renown

But this exceeding posting day and night

Must wear your spirits low We cannot help it

But since you have made the days and nights as one

To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs

Be bold you do so grow in my requital

As nothing can unroot you    In happy time

This man may help me to his Majesty's ear

If he would spend his powerGod save you sir

Sir I have seen you in the court of France

I do presume sir that you are not fall'n

From the report that goes upon your goodness

And therefore goaded with most sharp occasions

Which lay nice manners by I put you to

The use of your own virtues for the which

I shall continue thankful

That it will please you

To give this poor petition to the King

And aid me with that store of power you have

To come into his presence

Not here sir

All's well that ends well yet

Though time seem so adverse and means unfit

I do beseech you whither is he gone

I do beseech you sir

Since you are like to see the King before me

Commend the paper to his gracious hand

Which I presume shall render you no blame

But rather make you thank your pains for it

I will come after you with what good speed

Our means will make us means

And you shall find yourself to be well thanked

Whate'er falls more We must to horse again

Go go provide

No my good lord

'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see

The name and not the thing

O my good lord when I was like this maid

I found you wondrous kind There is your ring

And look you here's your letterThis it says

When from my finger you can get this ring

And are by me with child etc This is done

Will you be mine now you are doubly won

If it appear not plain and prove untrue

Deadly divorce step between me and you

O my dear mother do I see you living
