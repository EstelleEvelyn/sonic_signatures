Lord Protector will come this way by and by, and

then we may deliver our supplications in the quill.

Here he comes, methinks, and the

Queen with him. I’ll be the first, sure.

I pray, my lord, pardon me. I took

you for my Lord Protector.

Mine is, an ’t please your Grace,

against John Goodman, my Lord Cardinal’s man,

for keeping my house, and lands, and wife and all,

from me.

Come, let’s be gone.
