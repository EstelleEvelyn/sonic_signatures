Bless you, fair shrew.

What’s that?

Good Mistress Accost, I desire better

acquaintance.

Good Mistress Mary Accost—

By my troth, I would not undertake her in

this company. Is that the meaning of “accost”?

An you part so, mistress, I would I might

never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you

have fools in hand?

Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my

hand.

Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your

metaphor?

Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I

can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?

Are you full of them?

Never in your life, I think, unless you see

canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have

no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man

has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that

does harm to my wit.

An I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride

home tomorrow, Sir Toby.

What is “pourquoi”? Do, or not do? I would I

had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in

fencing, dancing, and bearbaiting. O, had I but

followed the arts!

Why, would that have mended my hair?

But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?

Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your

niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one

she’ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by

woos her.

I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ th’

strangest mind i’ th’ world. I delight in masques

and revels sometimes altogether.

As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,

under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not

compare with an old man.

Faith, I can cut a caper.

And I think I have the back-trick simply as

strong as any man in Illyria.

Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a

dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some

revels?

Taurus? That’s sides and heart.

Nay, by my troth, I know not. But I know to

be up late is to be up late.

Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists

of eating and drinking.

Here comes the Fool, i’ faith.

By my troth, the Fool has an excellent breast.

I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,

and so sweet a breath to sing, as the Fool has.—In

sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night

when thou spok’st of Pigrogromitus of the Vapians

passing the equinoctial of Queubus. ’Twas very

good, i’ faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.

Hadst it?

Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling when

all is done. Now, a song!

There’s a testril of

me, too. If one knight give a—

Ay, ay, I care not for good life.

Excellent good, i’ faith!

A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.

Very sweet and contagious, i’ faith.

An you love me, let’s do ’t. I am dog at a

catch.

Most certain. Let our catch be “Thou

Knave.”

’Tis not the first time I have constrained one

to call me “knave.” Begin, Fool. It begins “Hold

thy peace.”

Good, i’ faith. Come, begin.

Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed,

and so do I, too. He does it with a better grace, but

I do it more natural.

’Twere as good a deed as to drink when a

man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the field and

then to break promise with him and make a fool of

him.

O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!

I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have

reason good enough.

I have ’t in my nose, too.

And your horse now would make him an ass.

O, ’twill be admirable!

Before me, she’s a good wench.

I was adored once, too.

If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way

out.

If I do not, never trust me, take it how you

will.

An we do not, it is pity of our lives.

’Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

Pistol him, pistol him!

Fie on him, Jezebel!

That’s me, I warrant you.

I knew ’twas I, for many do call me

fool.

Her ’s, her ’s, and her ’s. Why that?

So could I too.

Nor I neither.

Or o’ mine either?

I’ faith, or I either?

I’ll make one, too.

Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.

That youth’s a rare courtier. “Rain

odors,” well.

“Odors,” “pregnant,” and “vouchsafed.”

I’ll get ’em all three all ready.

No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.

Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the

Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon

me. I saw ’t i’ th’ orchard.

As plain as I see you now.

’Slight, will you make an ass o’ me?

An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for

policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a

politician.

Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?

Where shall I find you?

Here’s the challenge.

Read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in ’t.

Ay, is ’t. I warrant him. Do but read.

Nay, let me alone for swearing.

Pox on ’t! I’ll not meddle with him.

Plague on ’t! An I thought he had been

valiant, and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him

damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let

the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray

Capilet.

Pray God he keep his

oath!

Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised

you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you

easily, and reins well.

’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.

An I do not—

Now, sir, have I met you again?

There’s for you.

Nay, let him alone. I’ll go another way to

work with him. I’ll have an action of battery against

him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck

him first, yet it’s no matter for that.

For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one

presently to Sir Toby.

Has broke my head across, and has given Sir

Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God,

your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at

home.

The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took

him for a coward, but he’s the very devil

incardinate.

’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my

head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to

do ’t by Sir Toby.

If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt

me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.

Here comes Sir Toby halting. You shall hear

more. But if he had not been in drink, he would

have tickled you othergates than he did.

I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be

dressed together.
