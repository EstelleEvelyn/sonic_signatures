


Doth your Highness call

My lord 'tis done

My lord if I can get him within my pistol's

length I'll make him sure enough So farewell to

your Highness

So this is Tyre and this the court Here

must I kill King Pericles and if I do it not I am

sure to be hanged at home 'Tis dangerous Well I

perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion

that being bid to ask what he would of the

king desired he might know none of his secrets

Now do I see he had some reason for 't for if a

king bid a man be a villain he's bound by the

indenture of his oath to be one Husht Here

comes the lords of Tyre

How The King gone

What from Antioch

Well I perceive I shall not be hanged

now although I would but since he's gone the

King's ears it must please He 'scaped the land to

perish at the sea I'll present myselfPeace to the

lords of Tyre

From him I come with message unto princely

Pericles but since my landing I have understood

your lord has betook himself to unknown travels

Now message must return from whence it came
