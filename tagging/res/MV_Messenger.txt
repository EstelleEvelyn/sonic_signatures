Madam, there is alighted at your gate

A young Venetian, one that comes before

To signify th’ approaching of his lord,

From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;

To wit (besides commends and courteous breath),

Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen

So likely an ambassador of love.

A day in April never came so sweet,

To show how costly summer was at hand,

As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
