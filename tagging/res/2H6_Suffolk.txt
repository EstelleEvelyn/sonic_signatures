


As by your high imperial Majesty

I had in charge at my depart for France

As procurator to your Excellence

To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace

So in the famous ancient city Tours

In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil

The Dukes of Orleance Calaber Britaigne and Alanson

Seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops

I have performed my task and was espoused

And humbly now upon my bended knee

In sight of England and her lordly peers

Deliver up my title in the Queen

To your most gracious hands that are the substance

Of that great shadow I did represent

The happiest gift that ever marquess gave

The fairest queen that ever king received

Long live Queen Margaret England's happiness

My Lord Protector so it please your Grace

Here are the articles of contracted peace

Between our sovereign and the French king Charles

For eighteen months concluded by consent

How now fellow Wouldst anything with

me

Thy wife too That's some wrong indeed

What's yours What's here

Against the Duke of Suffolk for enclosing

the commons of Melford How now sir knave

Who is there

Take this fellow in and send for his master with a

pursuivant presentlyWe'll hear more of your

matter before the King

Madam be patient As I was cause

Your Highness came to England so will I

In England work your Grace's full content

And he of these that can do most of all

Cannot do more in England than the Nevilles

Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers

Madam myself have limed a bush for her

And placed a choir of such enticing birds

That she will light to listen to the lays

And never mount to trouble you again

So let her rest And madam list to me

For I am bold to counsel you in this

Although we fancy not the Cardinal

Yet must we join with him and with the lords

Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace

As for the Duke of York this late complaint

Will make but little for his benefit

So one by one we'll weed them all at last

And you yourself shall steer the happy helm

Resign it then and leave thine insolence

Since thou wert kingas who is king but thou

The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack

The Dauphin hath prevailed beyond the seas

And all the peers and nobles of the realm

Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty

Before we make election give me leave

To show some reason of no little force

That York is most unmeet of any man

Peace headstrong Warwick

Because here is a man accused of treason

Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself

Please it your Majesty this is the man

That doth accuse his master of high treason

His words were these that Richard Duke of York

Was rightful heir unto the English crown

And that your Majesty was an usurper

No marvel an it like your Majesty

My Lord Protector's hawks do tower so well

They know their master loves to be aloft

And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch

No malice sir no more than well becomes

So good a quarrel and so bad a peer

Why as you my lord

An 't like your lordly Lord Protectorship

Come to the King and tell him what miracle

What woman is this

How cam'st thou so

And yet I think jet did he never see

True made the lame to leap and fly away

Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays

Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days

Well hath your Highness seen into this duke

And had I first been put to speak my mind

I think I should have told your Grace's tale

The Duchess by his subornation

Upon my life began her devilish practices

Or if he were not privy to those faults

Yet by reputing of his high descent

As next the King he was successive heir

And such high vaunts of his nobility

Did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess

By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall

Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep

And in his simple show he harbors treason

The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb

No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man

Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit

Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon

Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art

I do arrest thee of high treason here

My lord these faults are easy quickly answered

But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge

Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself

I do arrest you in his Highness' name

And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal

To keep until your further time of trial

Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here

With ignominious words though clerkly couched

As if she had subornd some to swear

False allegations to o'erthrow his state

But in my mind that were no policy

The King will labor still to save his life

The Commons haply rise to save his life

And yet we have but trivial argument

More than mistrust that shows him worthy death

Ah York no man alive so fain as I

Madam 'tis true and were 't not madness then

To make the fox surveyor of the fold

Who being accused a crafty murderer

His guilt should be but idly posted over

Because his purpose is not executed

No let him die in that he is a fox

By nature proved an enemy to the flock

Before his chaps be stained with crimson blood

As Humphrey proved by reasons to my liege

And do not stand on quillets how to slay him

Be it by gins by snares by subtlety

Sleeping or waking 'Tis no matter how

So he be dead for that is good deceit

Which mates him first that first intends deceit

Not resolute except so much were done

For things are often spoke and seldom meant

But that my heart accordeth with my tongue

Seeing the deed is meritorious

And to preserve my sovereign from his foe

Say but the word and I will be his priest

Here is my hand The deed is worthy doing

Why our authority is his consent

And what we do establish he confirms

Then noble York take thou this task in hand

A charge Lord York that I will see performed

But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey

I'll see it truly done my lord of York

Now sirs have you dispatched this thing

Why that's well said Go get you to my house

I will reward you for this venturous deed

The King and all the peers are here at hand

Have you laid fair the bed Is all things well

According as I gave directions

Away be gone

I'll call him presently my noble lord

Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead

He doth revive again Madam be patient

Comfort my sovereign Gracious Henry comfort

A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue

What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow

Why Warwick who should do the Duke to death

Myself and Beaufort had him in protection

And we I hope sir are no murderers

I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men

But here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease

That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart

That slanders me with murder's crimson badge

Say if thou dar'st proud lord of Warwickshire

That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death

Blunt-witted lord ignoble in demeanor

If ever lady wronged her lord so much

Thy mother took into her blameful bed

Some stern untutored churl and noble stock

Was graft with crab-tree slip whose fruit thou art

And never of the Nevilles' noble race

Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood

If from this presence thou dar'st go with me

The trait'rous Warwick with the men of Bury

Set all upon me mighty sovereign

'Tis like the Commons rude unpolished hinds

Could send such message to their sovereign

But you my lord were glad to be employed

To show how quaint an orator you are

But all the honor Salisbury hath won

Is that he was the lord ambassador

Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King

Cease gentle queen these execrations

And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave

A plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them

Could curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan

I would invent as bitter searching terms

As curst as harsh and horrible to hear

Delivered strongly through my fixd teeth

With full as many signs of deadly hate

As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave

My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words

Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint

Mine hair be fixed on end as one distract

Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban

And even now my burdened heart would break

Should I not curse them Poison be their drink

Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste

Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees

Their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks

Their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings

Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss

And boding screech owls make the consort full

All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell

You bade me ban and will you bid me leave

Now by the ground that I am banished from

Well could I curse away a winter's night

Though standing naked on a mountain top

Where biting cold would never let grass grow

And think it but a minute spent in sport

Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banishd

Once by the King and three times thrice by thee

'Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence

A wilderness is populous enough

So Suffolk had thy heavenly company

For where thou art there is the world itself

With every several pleasure in the world

And where thou art not desolation

I can no more Live thou to joy thy life

Myself no joy in naught but that thou liv'st

If I depart from thee I cannot live

And in thy sight to die what were it else

But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap

Here could I breathe my soul into the air

As mild and gentle as the cradle babe

Dying with mother's dug between its lips

Where from thy sight I should be raging mad

And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes

To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth

So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul

Or I should breathe it so into thy body

And then it lived in sweet Elysium

To die by thee were but to die in jest

From thee to die were torture more than death

O let me stay befall what may befall

I go

A jewel locked into the woefull'st cask

That ever did contain a thing of worth

Even as a splitted bark so sunder we

This way fall I to death

Look on my George I am a gentleman

Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid

Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death

A cunning man did calculate my birth

And told me that by water I should die

Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded

Thy name is Gualtier being rightly sounded

Stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince

The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole

Ay but these rags are no part of the Duke

Jove sometimes went disguised and why not I

Obscure and lousy swain King Henry's blood

The honorable blood of Lancaster

Must not be shed by such a jaded groom

Hast thou not kissed thy hand and held my stirrup

Bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule

And thought thee happy when I shook my head

How often hast thou waited at my cup

Fed from my trencher kneeled down at the board

When I have feasted with Queen Margaret

Remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n

Ay and allay this thy abortive pride

How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood

And duly waited for my coming forth

This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf

And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue

Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou

Thou dar'st not for thy own

Pole

O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder

Upon these paltry servile abject drudges

Small things make base men proud This villain here

Being captain of a pinnace threatens more

Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate

Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives

It is impossible that I should die

By such a lowly vassal as thyself

Thy words move rage and not remorse in me

I go of message from the Queen to France

I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel

Paene gelidus timor occupat artus

It is thee I fear

Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough

Used to command untaught to plead for favor

Far be it we should honor such as these

With humble suit No rather let my head

Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any

Save to the God of heaven and to my king

And sooner dance upon a bloody pole

Than stand uncovered to the vulgar groom

True nobility is exempt from fear

More can I bear than you dare execute

Come soldiers show what cruelty you can

That this my death may never be forgot

Great men oft die by vile bezonians

A Roman sworder and banditto slave

Murdered sweet Tully Brutus' bastard hand

Stabbed Julius Caesar savage islanders

Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates
