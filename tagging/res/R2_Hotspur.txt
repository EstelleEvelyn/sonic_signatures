


I had thought my lord to have learned his health of you

No my good lord he hath forsook the court

Broken his staff of office and dispersed

The Household of the King

Because your Lordship was proclaimd traitor

But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh

To offer service to the Duke of Hereford

And sent me over by Berkeley to discover

What power the Duke of York had levied there

Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh

No my good lord for that is not forgot

Which ne'er I did remember To my knowledge

I never in my life did look on him

My gracious lord I tender you my service

Such as it is being tender raw and young

Which elder days shall ripen and confirm

To more approvd service and desert

There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees

Manned with three hundred men as I have heard

And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour

None else of name and noble estimate

The castle royally is manned my lord

Against thy entrance

Yes my good lord

It doth contain a king King Richard lies

Within the limits of yon lime and stone

And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury

Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman

Of holy reverencewho I cannot learn

Aumerle thou liest His honor is as true

In this appeal as thou art all unjust

And that thou art so there I throw my gage

To prove it on thee to the extremest point

Of mortal breathing Seize it if thou dar'st

My lord some two days since I saw the Prince

And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford

His answer was he would unto the stews

And from the common'st creature pluck a glove

And wear it as a favor and with that

He would unhorse the lustiest challenger

The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster

With clog of conscience and sour melancholy

Hath yielded up his body to the grave

But here is Carlisle living to abide

Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride
