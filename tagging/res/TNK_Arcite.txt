


Dear Palamon dearer in love than blood

And our prime cousin yet unhardened in

The crimes of nature let us leave the city

Thebes and the temptings in 't before we further

Sully our gloss of youth

And here to keep in abstinence we shame

As in incontinence for not to swim

I' th' aid o' th' current were almost to sink

At least to frustrate striving and to follow

The common stream 'twould bring us to an eddy

Where we should turn or drown if labor through

Our gain but life and weakness

Are you not out

Meet you no ruin but the soldier in

The cranks and turns of Thebes You did begin

As if you met decays of many kinds

Perceive you none that do arouse your pity

But th' unconsidered soldier

'Tis not this

I did begin to speak of This is virtue

Of no respect in Thebes I spake of Thebes

How dangerous if we will keep our honors

It is for our residing where every evil

Hath a good color where every seeming good's

A certain evil where not to be e'en jump

As they are here were to be strangers and

Such things to be mere monsters

Our Uncle Creon

Clear-spirited cousin

Let's leave his court that we may nothing share

Of his loud infamy for our milk

Will relish of the pasture and we must

Be vile or disobedient not his kinsmen

In blood unless in quality

Let him approach

But that we fear the gods in him he brings not

A jot of terror to us Yet what man

Thirds his own worththe case is each of ours

When that his action's dregged with mind assured

'Tis bad he goes about

So we must

Is 't said this war's afoot Or it shall be

On fail of some condition

Let th' event

That never-erring arbitrator tell us

When we know all ourselves and let us follow

The becking of our chance

How do you sir

I believe it

And to that destiny have patiently

Laid up my hour to come

No Palamon

Those hopes are prisoners with us Here we are

And here the graces of our youths must wither

Like a too-timely spring Here age must find us

Andwhich is heaviest Palamonunmarried

The sweet embraces of a loving wife

Loaden with kisses armed with thousand Cupids

Shall never clasp our necks no issue know us

No figures of ourselves shall we e'er see

To glad our age and like young eagles teach 'em

Boldly to gaze against bright arms and say

Remember what your fathers were and conquer

The fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishments

And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune

Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done

To youth and nature This is all our world

We shall know nothing here but one another

Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes

The vine shall grow but we shall never see it

Summer shall come and with her all delights

But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still

Yet cousin

Even from the bottom of these miseries

From all that fortune can inflict upon us

I see two comforts rising two mere blessings

If the gods please to hold here a brave patience

And the enjoying of our griefs together

Whilst Palamon is with me let me perish

If I think this our prison

Shall we make worthy uses of this place

That all men hate so much

Let's think this prison holy sanctuary

To keep us from corruption of worse men

We are young and yet desire the ways of honor

That liberty and common conversation

The poison of pure spirits might like women

Woo us to wander from What worthy blessing

Can be but our imaginations

May make it ours And here being thus together

We are an endless mine to one another

We are one another's wife ever begetting

New births of love we are father friends acquaintance

We are in one another families

I am your heir and you are mine This place

Is our inheritance no hard oppressor

Dare take this from us here with a little patience

We shall live long and loving No surfeits seek us

The hand of war hurts none here nor the seas

Swallow their youth Were we at liberty

A wife might part us lawfully or business

Quarrels consume us envy of ill men

Crave our acquaintance I might sicken cousin

Where you should never know it and so perish

Without your noble hand to close mine eyes

Or prayers to the gods A thousand chances

Were we from hence would sever us

I would hear you still

Sure there cannot

Till our deaths it cannot

And after death our spirits shall be led

To those that love eternally Speak on sir

Pray forward

Will you go forward cousin

Cousin cousin How do you sir Why Palamon

Why what's the matter man

Ha

She is wondrous fair

'Tis a rare one

Yes a matchless beauty

I cannot tell what you have done I have

Beshrew mine eyes for 't Now I feel my shackles

Who would not

Before my liberty

That's nothing

I saw her too

I will not as you do to worship her

As she is heavenly and a blessd goddess

I love her as a woman to enjoy her

So both may love

Not love at all Who shall deny me

Yes I love her

And if the lives of all my name lay on it

I must do so I love her with my soul

If that will lose you farewell Palamon

I say again I love and in loving her maintain

I am as worthy and as free a lover

And have as just a title to her beauty

As any Palamon or any living

That is a man's son

Yes and have found me so Why are you moved thus

Let me deal coldly with you am not I

Part of your blood part of your soul You have told me

That I was Palamon and you were Arcite

Am not I liable to those affections

Those joys griefs angers fears my friend shall suffer

Why then would you deal so cunningly

So strangely so unlike a noble kinsman

To love alone Speak truly do you think me

Unworthy of her sight

Because another

First sees the enemy shall I stand still

And let mine honor down and never charge

But say that one

Had rather combat me

You are mad

Fie sir

You play the child extremely I will love her

I must I ought to do so and I dare

And all this justly

Thou dar'st not fool thou canst not thou art feeble

Put my head out I'll throw my body out

And leap the garden when I see her next

And pitch between her arms to anger thee

Do

I am ready keeper

Banished the kingdom 'Tis a benefit

A mercy I must thank 'em for but banished

The free enjoying of that face I die for

O 'twas a studied punishment a death

Beyond imaginationsuch a vengeance

That were I old and wicked all my sins

Could never pluck upon me Palamon

Thou hast the start now thou shalt stay and see

Her bright eyes break each morning 'gainst thy window

And let in life into thee thou shalt feed

Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty

That nature ne'er exceeded nor ne'er shall

Good gods what happiness has Palamon

Twenty to one he'll come to speak to her

And if she be as gentle as she's fair

I know she's his He has a tongue will tame

Tempests and make the wild rocks wanton

Come what can come

The worst is death I will not leave the kingdom

I know mine own is but a heap of ruins

And no redress there If I go he has her

I am resolved another shape shall make me

Or end my fortunes Either way I am happy

I'll see her and be near her or no more

By your leaves honest friends pray you

whither go you

Yes 'tis a question

To me that know not

Not far sir

Are there such games today

What pastimes are they

Not yet sir

This is an offered opportunity

I durst not wish for Well I could have wrestled

The best men called it excellentand run

Swifter than wind upon a field of corn

Curling the wealthy ears never flew I'll venture

And in some poor disguise be there Who knows

Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands

And happiness prefer me to a place

Where I may ever dwell in sight of her

I am proud to please you

This but far off prince

My father said so

And to those gentle uses gave me life

His youngest sir

A little of all noble qualities

I could have kept a hawk and well have hallowed

To a deep cry of dogs I dare not praise

My feat in horsemanship yet they that knew me

Would say it was my best piece Last and greatest

I would be thought a soldier

Noble Theseus

To purchase name and do my ablest service

To such a well-found wonder as thy worth

For only in thy court of all the world

Dwells fair-eyed Honor

Sir you're a noble giverDearest beauty

Thus let me seal my vowed faith  When your servant

Your most unworthy creature but offends you

Command him die he shall

I like him better prince I shall not then

Freeze in my saddle

If I do not

Let me find that my father ever hated

Disgrace and blows

The Duke has lost Hippolyta each took

A several laund This is a solemn rite

They owe bloomed May and the Athenians pay it

To th' heart of ceremony O Queen Emilia

Fresher than May sweeter

Than her gold buttons on the boughs or all

Th' enameled knacks o' th' mead or gardenyea

We challenge too the bank of any nymph

That makes the stream seem flowers thou O jewel

O' th' wood o' th' world hast likewise blessed a pace

With thy sole presence In thy rumination

That I poor man might eftsoons come between

And chop on some cold thought Thrice blessd chance

To drop on such a mistress expectation

Most guiltless on 't Tell me O Lady Fortune

Next after Emily my sovereign how far

I may be proud She takes strong note of me

Hath made me near her and this beauteous morn

The prim'st of all the year presents me with

A brace of horses two such steeds might well

Be by a pair of kings backed in a field

That their crowns' titles tried Alas alas

Poor cousin Palamon poor prisoner thou

So little dream'st upon my fortune that

Thou think'st thyself the happier thing to be

So near Emilia me thou deem'st at Thebes

And therein wretched although free But if

Thou knew'st my mistress breathed on me and that

I eared her language lived in her eyeO coz

What passion would enclose thee

Dear cousin Palamon

Not finding in

The circuit of my breast any gross stuff

To form me like your blazon holds me to

This gentleness of answer 'tis your passion

That thus mistakes the which to you being enemy

Cannot to me be kind Honor and honesty

I cherish and depend on howsoe'er

You skip them in me and with them fair coz

I'll maintain my proceedings Pray be pleased

To show in generous terms your griefs since that

Your question's with your equal who professes

To clear his own way with the mind and sword

Of a true gentleman

My coz my coz you have been well advertised

How much I dare you've seen me use my sword

Against th' advice of fear Sure of another

You would not hear me doubted but your silence

Should break out though i' th' sanctuary

Kinsman you might as well

Speak this and act it in your glass as to

His ear which now disdains you

Be content

Again betake you to your hawthorn house

With counsel of the night I will be here

With wholesome viands These impediments

Will I file off You shall have garments and

Perfumes to kill the smell o' th' prison After

When you shall stretch yourself and say but Arcite

I am in plight there shall be at your choice

Both sword and armor

Sweet Palamon

You hear the horns

Enter your muset lest this match between 's

Be crossed ere met Give me your hand farewell

I'll bring you every needful thing I pray you

Take comfort and be strong

Plainly spoken

Yet pardon me hard language When I spur

My horse I chide him not content and anger

In me have but one face Hark sir they call

The scattered to the banquet you must guess

I have an office there

'Tis a good title

I am persuaded this question sick between 's

By bleeding must be cured I am a suitor

That to your sword you will bequeath this plea

And talk of it no more

Nay then

I should be near the placeHo Cousin Palamon

The same I have brought you food and files

Come forth and fear not here's no Theseus

That's no matter

We'll argue that hereafter Come take courage

You shall not die thus beastly Here sir drink

I know you are faintthen I'll talk further with you

I might

But I must fear you first Sit down and good now

No more of these vain parleys Let us not

Having our ancient reputation with us

Make talk for fools and cowards To your health

Pray sit down then and let me entreat you

By all the honesty and honor in you

No mention of this woman 'twill disturb us

We shall have time enough

Drink a good hearty draught it breeds good blood man

Do not you feel it thaw you

Spare it not

The Duke has more coz Eat now

I am glad

You have so good a stomach

Is 't not mad lodging

Here in the wild woods cousin

How tastes your victuals

Your hunger needs no sauce I see

Venison

After you coz

She did so well sir

Out with 't faith

Something she did sir

The Marshal's sister

Had her share too as I remember cousin

Else there be tales abroad You'll pledge her

A pretty brown wench 'tis There was a time

When young men went a-hunting and a wood

And a broad beechand thereby hangs a tale

Heigh ho

You are wide

Then I'll leave you

You are a beast now

There's all things needful files and shirts and perfumes

I'll come again some two hours hence and bring

That that shall quiet all

Fear me not You are now too foul Farewell

Get off your trinkets you shall want naught

I'll hear no more

Good morrow noble kinsman

That too much fair cousin

Is but a debt to honor and my duty

I shall think either

Well done a noble recompense

Defy me in these fair terms and you show

More than a mistress to me No more anger

As you love anything that's honorable

We were not bred to talk man when we are armed

And both upon our guards then let our fury

Like meeting of two tides fly strongly from us

And then to whom the birthright of this beauty

Truly pertainswithout upbraidings scorns

Despisings of our persons and such poutings

Fitter for girls and schoolboyswill be seen

And quickly yours or mine Will 't please you arm sir

Or if you feel yourself not fitting yet

And furnished with your old strength I'll stay cousin

And ev'ry day discourse you into health

As I am spared Your person I am friends with

And I could wish I had not said I loved her

Though I had died But loving such a lady

And justifying my love I must not fly from 't

Choose you sir

If you think so cousin

You are deceived for as I am a soldier

I will not spare you

You'll find it

That's mine then

I'll arm you first

'Tis the Duke's

And to say true I stole it Do I pinch you

Is 't not too heavy

I'll buckle 't close

You care not for a grand guard

I am indifferent

I warrant you

Will you fight bare-armed

But use your gauntlets though Those are o' th' least

Prithee take mine good cousin

Faith very little love has used you kindly

Do and spare not

I'll give you cause sweet cousin

That was a very good one and that day

I well remember you outdid me cousin

I never saw such valor When you charged

Upon the left wing of the enemy

I spurred hard to come up and under me

I had a right good horse

Yes but all

Was vainly labored in me you outwent me

Nor could my wishes reach you yet a little

I did by imitation

When I saw you charge first

Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder

Break from the troop

No no 'tis well

Now I am perfect

Take my sword I hold it better

And me my love  Is there aught else to say

Here Palamon This hand shall never more

Come near thee with such friendship

If I fall curse me and say I was a coward

For none but such dare die in these just trials

Once more farewell my cousin

Lo cousin lo our folly has undone us

This is the Duke a-hunting as I told you

If we be found we are wretched O retire

For honor's sake and safely presently

Into your bush again Sir we shall find

Too many hours to die in Gentle cousin

If you be seen you perish instantly

For breaking prison and I if you reveal me

For my contempt Then all the world will scorn us

And say we had a noble difference

But base disposers of it

You are not mad

Then come what can come

Thou shalt know Palamon I dare as well

Die as discourse or sleep Only this fears me

The law will have the honor of our ends

Have at thy life

We seek not

Thy breath of mercy Theseus 'Tis to me

A thing as soon to die as thee to say it

And no more moved Where this man calls me traitor

Let me say thus much if in love be treason

In service of so excellent a beauty

As I love most and in that faith will perish

As I have brought my life here to confirm it

As I have served her truest worthiest

As I dare kill this cousin that denies it

So let me be most traitor and you please me

For scorning thy edict duke ask that lady

Why she is fair and why her eyes command me

Stay here to love her and if she say traitor

I am a villain fit to lie unburied

No never duke 'Tis worse to me than begging

To take my life so basely though I think

I never shall enjoy her yet I'll preserve

The honor of affection and die for her

Make death a devil

With all our souls

Any death thou canst invent duke

If she refuse me yet my grave will wed me

And soldiers sing my epitaph

I embrace you

I am in labor

To push your name your ancient love our kindred

Out of my memory and i' th' selfsame place

To seat something I would confound So hoist we

The sails that must these vessels port even where

The heavenly Limiter pleases

One farewell

Farewell sir

Knights kinsmen lovers yea my sacrifices

True worshippers of Mars whose spirit in you

Expels the seeds of fear and th' apprehension

Which still is father of it go with me

Before the god of our profession There

Require of him the hearts of lions and

The breath of tigers yea the fierceness too

Yea the speed alsoto go on I mean

Else wish we to be snails You know my prize

Must be dragged out of blood force and great feat

Must put my garland on where she sticks

The queen of flowers Our intercession then

Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern

Brimmed with the blood of men Give me your aid

And bend your spirits towards him

Thou mighty one that with thy power hast turned

Green Neptune into purple whose approach

Comets prewarn whose havoc in vast field

Unearthd skulls proclaim whose breath blows down

The teeming Ceres' foison who dost pluck

With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds

The masoned turrets that both mak'st and break'st

The stony girths of cities me thy pupil

Youngest follower of thy drum instruct this day

With military skill that to thy laud

I may advance my streamer and by thee

Be styled the lord o' th' day Give me great Mars

Some token of thy pleasure

O great corrector of enormous times

Shaker of o'er-rank states thou grand decider

Of dusty and old titles that heal'st with blood

The Earth when it is sick and cur'st the world

O' th' pleurisy of people I do take

Thy signs auspiciously and in thy name

To my design march boldlyLet us go

Emily

To buy you I have lost what's dearest to me

Save what is bought and yet I purchase cheaply

As I do rate your value

Take Emilia

And with her all the world's joy Reach thy hand

Farewell I have told my last hour I was false

Yet never treacherous Forgive me cousin

One kiss from fair Emilia 'Tis done

Take her I die
