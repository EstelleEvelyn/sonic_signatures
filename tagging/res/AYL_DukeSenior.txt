Now my co-mates and brothers in exile

Hath not old custom made this life more sweet

Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods

More free from peril than the envious court

Here feel we not the penalty of Adam

The seasons' difference as the icy fang

And churlish chiding of the winter's wind

Which when it bites and blows upon my body

Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say

This is no flattery These are counselors

That feelingly persuade me what I am

Sweet are the uses of adversity

Which like the toad ugly and venomous

Wears yet a precious jewel in his head

And this our life exempt from public haunt

Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks

Sermons in stones and good in everything

Come shall we go and kill us venison

And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools

Being native burghers of this desert city

Should in their own confines with forkd heads

Have their round haunches gored

But what said Jaques

Did he not moralize this spectacle

And did you leave him in this contemplation

Show me the place

I love to cope him in these sullen fits

For then he's full of matter

I think he be transformed into a beast

For I can nowhere find him like a man

If he compact of jars grow musical

We shall have shortly discord in the spheres

Go seek him Tell him I would speak with him

Why how now monsieur What a life is this

That your poor friends must woo your company

What you look merrily

What fool is this

Thou shalt have one

Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do

Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin

For thou thyself hast been a libertine

As sensual as the brutish sting itself

And all th' embossd sores and headed evils

That thou with license of free foot hast caught

Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world

Art thou thus boldened man by thy distress

Or else a rude despiser of good manners

That in civility thou seem'st so empty

What would you have Your gentleness shall force

More than your force move us to gentleness

Sit down and feed and welcome to our table

True is it that we have seen better days

And have with holy bell been knolled to church

And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes

Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered

And therefore sit you down in gentleness

And take upon command what help we have

That to your wanting may be ministered

Go find him out

And we will nothing waste till you return

Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy

This wide and universal theater

Presents more woeful pageants than the scene

Wherein we play in

Welcome Set down your venerable burden

And let him feed

Welcome Fall to I will not trouble you

As yet to question you about your fortunes

Give us some music and good cousin sing

If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son

As you have whispered faithfully you were

And as mine eye doth his effigies witness

Most truly limned and living in your face

Be truly welcome hither I am the duke

That loved your father The residue of your fortune

Go to my cave and tell meGood old man

Thou art right welcome as thy master is

Support him by the arm Give me your hand

And let me all your fortunes understand

Dost thou believe Orlando that the boy

Can do all this that he hath promisd

That would I had I kingdoms to give with her

I do remember in this shepherd boy

Some lively touches of my daughter's favor

I like him very well

By my faith he is very swift and

sententious

He uses his folly like a stalking-horse

and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit

If there be truth in sight you are my daughter

O my dear niece welcome thou art to me

Even daughter welcome in no less degree

Welcome young man

Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding

To one his lands withheld and to the other

A land itself at large a potent dukedom

First in this forest let us do those ends

That here were well begun and well begot

And after every of this happy number

That have endured shrewd days and nights with us

Shall share the good of our returnd fortune

According to the measure of their states

Meantime forget this new-fall'n dignity

And fall into our rustic revelry

Play musicAnd you brides and bridegrooms all

With measure heaped in joy to th' measures fall

Stay Jaques stay

Proceed proceed We'll begin these rites

As we do trust they'll end in true delights
