


’Tis better as it is.

Let him do his spite.

My services which I have done the signiory

Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know

(Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,

I shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being

From men of royal siege, and my demerits

May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune

As this that I have reached. For know, Iago,

But that I love the gentle Desdemona,

I would not my unhousèd free condition

Put into circumscription and confine

For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come yond?

Not I. I must be found.

My parts, my title, and my perfect soul

Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant!

The goodness of the night upon you, friends.

What is the news?

What is the matter, think you?

’Tis well I am found by you.

I will but spend a word here in the house

And go with you.

Have with you.

Holla, stand there!

Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.

Good signior, you shall more command with years

Than with your weapons.

Hold your hands,

Both you of my inclining and the rest.

Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it

Without a prompter.—Whither will you that I go

To answer this your charge?

What if I do obey?

How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,

Whose messengers are here about my side,

Upon some present business of the state,

To bring me to him?

Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,

My very noble and approved good masters:

That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,

It is most true; true I have married her.

The very head and front of my offending

Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,

And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;

For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,

Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used

Their dearest action in the tented field,

And little of this great world can I speak

More than pertains to feats of broil and battle.

And therefore little shall I grace my cause

In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,

I will a round unvarnished tale deliver

Of my whole course of love—what drugs, what charms,

What conjuration, and what mighty magic

(For such proceeding I am charged withal)

I won his daughter.

I do beseech you,

Send for the lady to the Sagittary

And let her speak of me before her father.

If you do find me foul in her report,

The trust, the office I do hold of you,

Not only take away, but let your sentence

Even fall upon my life.

Ancient, conduct them. You best know the place.

And till she come, as truly as to heaven

I do confess the vices of my blood,

So justly to your grave ears I’ll present

How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,

And she in mine.

Her father loved me, oft invited me,

Still questioned me the story of my life

From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes

That I have passed.

I ran it through, even from my boyish days

To th’ very moment that he bade me tell it,

Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:

Of moving accidents by flood and field,

Of hairbreadth ’scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach,

Of being taken by the insolent foe

And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,

And portance in my traveler’s history,

Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,

Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,

It was my hint to speak—such was my process—

And of the cannibals that each other eat,

The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads

Do grow beneath their shoulders. These things to hear

Would Desdemona seriously incline.

But still the house affairs would draw her thence,

Which ever as she could with haste dispatch

She’d come again, and with a greedy ear

Devour up my discourse. Which I, observing,

Took once a pliant hour, and found good means

To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart

That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,

Whereof by parcels she had something heard,

But not intentively. I did consent,

And often did beguile her of her tears

When I did speak of some distressful stroke

That my youth suffered. My story being done,

She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.

She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange,

’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.

She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished

That heaven had made her such a man. She thanked me,

And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,

I should but teach him how to tell my story,

And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.

She loved me for the dangers I had passed,

And I loved her that she did pity them.

This only is the witchcraft I have used.

Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.

The tyrant custom, most grave senators,

Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war

My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize

A natural and prompt alacrity

I find in hardness, and do undertake

This present wars against the Ottomites.

Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state,

I crave fit disposition for my wife,

Due reference of place and exhibition,

With such accommodation and besort

As levels with her breeding.

Nor I.

Let her have your voice.

Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not

To please the palate of my appetite,

Nor to comply with heat (the young affects

In me defunct) and proper satisfaction,

But to be free and bounteous to her mind.

And heaven defend your good souls that you think

I will your serious and great business scant

For she is with me. No, when light-winged toys

Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness

My speculative and officed instruments,

That my disports corrupt and taint my business,

Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,

And all indign and base adversities

Make head against my estimation.

With all my heart.

So please your Grace, my ancient.

A man he is of honesty and trust.

To his conveyance I assign my wife,

With what else needful your good Grace shall think

To be sent after me.

My life upon her faith!  Honest Iago,

My Desdemona must I leave to thee.

I prithee let thy wife attend on her,

And bring them after in the best advantage.—

Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour

Of love, of worldly matters, and direction

To spend with thee. We must obey the time.

O, my fair warrior!

It gives me wonder great as my content

To see you here before me. O my soul’s joy!

If after every tempest come such calms,

May the winds blow till they have wakened death,

And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas

Olympus high, and duck again as low

As hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,

’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear

My soul hath her content so absolute

That not another comfort like to this

Succeeds in unknown fate.

Amen to that, sweet powers!

I cannot speak enough of this content.

It stops me here; it is too much of joy.

And this, and this, the greatest discords be

That e’er our hearts shall make!

Come. Let us to the castle.—

News, friends! Our wars are done. The Turks are drowned.

How does my old acquaintance of this isle?—

Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.

I have found great love amongst them. O, my sweet,

I prattle out of fashion, and I dote

In mine own comforts.—I prithee, good Iago,

Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.

Bring thou the master to the citadel.

He is a good one, and his worthiness

Does challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona.

Once more, well met at Cyprus.

Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.

Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop

Not to outsport discretion.

Iago is most honest.

Michael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest

Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love,

The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;

That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.—

Goodnight.

What is the matter here?

Hold, for your lives!

Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?

Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that

Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?

For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!

He that stirs next to carve for his own rage

Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.

Silence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle

From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?

Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,

Speak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.

How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.

The gravity and stillness of your youth

The world hath noted. And your name is great

In mouths of wisest censure. What’s the matter

That you unlace your reputation thus,

And spend your rich opinion for the name

Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.

Now, by heaven,

My blood begins my safer guides to rule,

And passion, having my best judgment collied,

Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,

Or do but lift this arm, the best of you

Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know

How this foul rout began, who set it on;

And he that is approved in this offense,

Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth,

Shall lose me. What, in a town of war

Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,

To manage private and domestic quarrel,

In night, and on the court and guard of safety?

’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began ’t?

I know, Iago,

Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,

Making it light to Cassio.—Cassio, I love thee,

But nevermore be officer of mine.

Look if my gentle love be not raised up!

I’ll make thee an example.

All’s well now, sweeting.

Come away to bed. Sir, for your hurts,

Myself will be your surgeon.—Lead him off.

Iago, look with care about the town

And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.—

Come, Desdemona. ’Tis the soldier’s life

To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

These letters give, Iago, to the pilot

And by him do my duties to the Senate.

That done, I will be walking on the works.

Repair there to me.

This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see ’t?

What dost thou say?

Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

I do believe ’twas he.

Who is ’t you mean?

Went he hence now?

Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.

The sooner, sweet, for you.

No, not tonight.

I shall not dine at home;

I meet the captains at the citadel.

Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;

I will deny thee nothing.

I will deny thee nothing!

Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,

To leave me but a little to myself.

Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.

Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul

But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,

Chaos is come again.

What dost thou say, Iago?

He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?

Why of thy thought, Iago?

O yes, and went between us very oft.

Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that?

Is he not honest?

Honest—ay, honest.

What dost thou think?

“Think, my lord?” By heaven, thou echo’st me

As if there were some monster in thy thought

Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.

I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,

When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?

And when I told thee he was of my counsel

In my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st “Indeed?”

And didst contract and purse thy brow together

As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain

Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,

Show me thy thought.

I think thou dost;

And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty

And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,

Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.

For such things in a false, disloyal knave

Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,

They’re close dilations working from the heart

That passion cannot rule.

I think so too.

Certain, men should be what they seem.

Nay, yet there’s more in this.

I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,

As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts

The worst of words.

Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,

If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear

A stranger to thy thoughts.

What dost thou mean?

By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.

Ha?

O misery!

Why, why is this?

Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,

To follow still the changes of the moon

With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt

Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat

When I shall turn the business of my soul

To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,

Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous

To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,

Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.

Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.

Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw

The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,

For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,

I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;

And on the proof, there is no more but this:

Away at once with love or jealousy.

Dost thou say so?

And so she did.

I am bound to thee forever.

Not a jot, not a jot.

I will not.

No, not much moved.

I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.

And yet, how nature erring from itself—

Farewell, farewell!

If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.

Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.

Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless

Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

Fear not my government.

This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,

And knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit

Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,

Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,

I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind

To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black

And have not those soft parts of conversation

That chamberers have, or for I am declined

Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much—

She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief

Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,

That we can call these delicate creatures ours

And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad

And live upon the vapor of a dungeon

Than keep a corner in the thing I love

For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones;

Prerogatived are they less than the base.

’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.

Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us

When we do quicken. Look where she comes.

If she be false, heaven mocks itself!

I’ll not believe ’t.

I am to blame.

I have a pain upon my forehead, here.

Your napkin is too little.

Let it alone. Come, I’ll go in with you.

Ha, ha, false to me?

Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.

I swear ’tis better to be much abused

Than but to know ’t a little.

What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?

I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.

I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry.

I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.

He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,

Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.

I had been happy if the general camp,

Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,

So I had nothing known. O, now, forever

Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!

Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars

That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!

Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,

The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,

The royal banner, and all quality,

Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!

And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats

Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,

Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!

Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!

Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,

Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,

Thou hadst been better have been born a dog

Than answer my waked wrath.

Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it

That the probation bear no hinge nor loop

To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!

If thou dost slander her and torture me,

Never pray more. Abandon all remorse;

On horror’s head horrors accumulate;

Do deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed;

For nothing canst thou to damnation add

Greater than that.

Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.

By the world,

I think my wife be honest and think she is not.

I think that thou art just and think thou art not.

I’ll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh

As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black

As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,

Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,

I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

Would? Nay, and I will.

Death and damnation! O!

Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.

O monstrous! Monstrous!

But this denoted a foregone conclusion.

’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

I’ll tear her all to pieces.

I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift.

If it be that—

O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!

One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.

Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,

All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.

’Tis gone.

Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!

Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne

To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,

For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!

O, blood, blood, blood!

Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,

Whose icy current and compulsive course

Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on

To the Propontic and the Hellespont,

Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace

Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,

Till that a capable and wide revenge

Swallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,

In the due reverence of a sacred vow,

I here engage my words.

I greet thy love

Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous,

And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.

Within these three days let me hear thee say

That Cassio’s not alive.

Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!

Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw

To furnish me with some swift means of death

For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

Well, my good lady. O, hardness to dissemble!—

How do you, Desdemona?

Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.

This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.

Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires

A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,

Much castigation, exercise devout;

For here’s a young and sweating devil here

That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,

A frank one.

A liberal hand! The hearts of old gave hands,

But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

What promise, chuck?

I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.

Lend me thy handkerchief.

That which I gave you.

Not?

That’s a fault. That handkerchief

Did an Egyptian to my mother give.

She was a charmer, and could almost read

The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,

’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father

Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,

Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye

Should hold her loathèd, and his spirits should hunt

After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,

And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,

To give it her. I did so; and take heed on ’t,

Make it a darling like your precious eye.

To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition

As nothing else could match.

’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.

A sybil that had numbered in the world

The sun to course two hundred compasses,

In her prophetic fury sewed the work.

The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,

And it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful

Conserved of maidens’ hearts.

Most veritable. Therefore, look to ’t well.

Ha? Wherefore?

Is ’t lost? Is ’t gone? Speak, is ’t out o’ th’ way?

Say you?

How?

Fetch ’t. Let me see ’t!

Fetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives.

The handkerchief!

The handkerchief!

The handkerchief!

Zounds!

Think so, Iago?

An unauthorized kiss!

Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?

It is hypocrisy against the devil!

They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,

The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

What then?

She is protectress of her honor, too.

May she give that?

By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.

Thou saidst—O, it comes o’er my memory

As doth the raven o’er the infectious house,

Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.

That’s not so good now.

Hath he said anything?

What hath he said?

What? What?

With her?

Lie with her? Lie on her? We say “lie on her”

when they belie her. Lie with her—Zounds, that’s

fulsome! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief.

To confess and be hanged for his labor.

First to be hanged and then to confess—I tremble

at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing

passion without some instruction. It is not

words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and

lips—is ’t possible? Confess—handkerchief—O,

devil!

Dost thou mock me?

A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast.

Did he confess it?

O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.

Dost thou hear, Iago,

I will be found most cunning in my patience,

But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.

Look how he laughs already!

Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.

Now he importunes him

To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.

Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?

So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.

Have you scored me? Well.

Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.

Crying, “O dear Cassio,” as it were; his

gesture imports it.

Now he tells how she plucked him to my

chamber.—O, I see that nose of yours, but not that

dog I shall throw it to.

By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

How shall I murder him,

Iago?

O Iago!

Was that mine?

I would have him nine years a-killing! A fine

woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!

Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned

tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned

to stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the

world hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by

an emperor’s side and command him tasks.

Hang her, I do but say what she is! So

delicate with her needle, an admirable musician—

O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!

Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!

O, a thousand, a thousand times!—And then

of so gentle a condition!

Nay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it,

Iago! O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?

With mine officer!

Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I’ll not

expostulate with her lest her body and beauty

unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.

Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very

good.

Excellent good. What trumpet is that same?

With all my heart, sir.

I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

Are you sure of that?

“This fail you not to do, as you

will”—

Fire and brimstone!

Are you wise?

Indeed?

I am glad to see you mad.

Devil!

O, devil, devil!

If that the Earth could teem with woman’s tears,

Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.

Out of my sight!

Mistress.

What would you with her, sir?

Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.

Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,

And turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep.

And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient.

Very obedient.—Proceed you in your tears.—

Concerning this, sir—O, well-painted passion!—

I am commanded home.—Get you away.

I’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate

And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!

Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight

I do entreat that we may sup together.

You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!

You have seen nothing then?

Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

What, did they never whisper?

Nor send you out o’ th’ way?

To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

That’s strange.

Bid her come hither. Go.

She says enough. Yet she’s a simple bawd

That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,

A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.

And yet she’ll kneel and pray. I have seen her do ’t.

Pray you, chuck, come hither.

Let me see your eyes. Look in my face.

Some of your function, mistress.

Leave procreants alone, and shut the door.

Cough, or cry “hem,” if anybody come.

Your mystery, your mystery! Nay, dispatch.

Why? What art thou?

Come, swear it. Damn thyself,

Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves

Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double damned.

Swear thou art honest.

Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

Ah, Desdemon, away, away, away!

Had it pleased heaven

To try me with affliction, had they rained

All kind of sores and shames on my bare head,

Steeped me in poverty to the very lips,

Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,

I should have found in some place of my soul

A drop of patience. But alas, to make me

A fixèd figure for the time of scorn

To point his slow unmoving finger at—

Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.

But there where I have garnered up my heart,

Where either I must live or bear no life,

The fountain from the which my current runs

Or else dries up—to be discarded thence,

Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads

To knot and gender in—turn thy complexion there,

Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,

Ay, there look grim as hell.

O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,

That quicken even with blowing! O thou weed,

Who art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet

That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne’er been born!

Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,

Made to write “whore” upon? What committed?

Committed? O thou public commoner,

I should make very forges of my cheeks

That would to cinders burn up modesty,

Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed?

Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;

The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets

Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth

And will not hear ’t. What committed?

Impudent strumpet!

Are not you a strumpet?

What, not a whore?

Is ’t possible?

I cry you mercy, then.

I took you for that cunning whore of Venice

That married with Othello.—You, mistress,

That have the office opposite to Saint Peter

And keeps the gate of hell—you, you, ay, you!

We have done our course. There’s money for your pains.

I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.

O, pardon me, ’twill do me good to walk.

Will you walk, sir?—O, Desdemona—

Get you to bed on th’ instant. I will be

returned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there.

Look ’t be done.

The voice of Cassio! Iago keeps his word.

It is even so.

’Tis he! O brave Iago, honest and just,

That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!

Thou teachest me.—Minion, your dear lies dead,

And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come.

Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted.

Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.

Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars.

It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,

Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,

And smooth as monumental alabaster.

Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.

Put out the light, and then put out the light.

If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,

I can again thy former light restore

Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,

Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,

I know not where is that Promethean heat

That can thy light relume. When I have plucked the rose,

I cannot give it vital growth again.

It needs must wither. I’ll smell it on the tree.

O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade

Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.

Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee

And love thee after. One more, and this the last.

So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,

But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly:

It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

Ay, Desdemona.

Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?

If you bethink yourself of any crime

Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,

Solicit for it straight.

Well, do it, and be brief. I will walk by.

I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit.

No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

Ay, I do.

Amen, with all my heart.

Humh.

Think on thy sins.

Ay, and for that thou diest.

Peace, and be still.

That handkerchief

Which I so loved, and gave thee, thou gav’st to Cassio.

Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury.

Thou art on thy deathbed.

Yes, presently.

Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin.

For to deny each article with oath

Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception

That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

I say “Amen.”

By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand!

O perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart

And mak’st me call what I intend to do

A murder, which I thought a sacrifice!

I saw the handkerchief!

He hath confessed.

That he hath used thee.

Ay.

No. His mouth is stopped.

Honest Iago hath ta’en order for ’t.

Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge

Had stomach for them all.

Out, strumpet! Weep’st thou for him to my face?

Down, strumpet!

Nay, if you strive—

Being done, there is no pause.

It is too late.

What noise is this?—Not dead? Not yet quite dead?

I that am cruel am yet merciful.

I would not have thee linger in thy pain.

So, so.

Who’s there?

Yes. ’Tis Emilia.—By and by.—She’s dead.

’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death.

The noise was here. Ha, no more moving?

Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were ’t good?

I think she stirs again. No. What’s best to do?

If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.

My wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.

O insupportable! O heavy hour!

Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse

Of sun and moon, and that th’ affrighted globe

Should yawn at alteration.

I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.—

Soft, by and by, let me the curtains draw.—

Where art thou?    What’s the matter with thee now?

What? Now?

It is the very error of the moon.

She comes more nearer Earth than she was wont

And makes men mad.

Roderigo killed? And Cassio killed?

Not Cassio killed? Then murder’s out of tune,

And sweet revenge grows harsh.

That? What?

Why, how should she be murdered?

You heard her say herself, it was not I.

She’s like a liar gone to burning hell!

’Twas I that killed her.

She turned to folly, and she was a whore.

She was false as water.

Cassio did top her. Ask thy husband else.

O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell

But that I did proceed upon just grounds

To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

Thy husband.

Ay, with Cassio. Had she been true,

If heaven would make me such another world

Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,

I’d not have sold her for it.

Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.

An honest man he is, and hates the slime

That sticks on filthy deeds.

What needs this iterance, woman? I say, thy husband.

He, woman.

I say thy husband. Dost understand the word?

My friend, thy husband; honest, honest Iago.

Hah?

Peace, you were best!

Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.

O, O, O!

O, she was foul!—

I scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,

Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopped.

I know this act shows horrible and grim.

’Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows

That she with Cassio hath the act of shame

A thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it,

And she did gratify his amorous works

With that recognizance and pledge of love

Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand.

It was a handkerchief, an antique token

My father gave my mother.

Are there no stones in heaven

But what serves for the thunder?—Precious villain!

I am not valiant neither,

But every puny whipster gets my sword.

But why should honor outlive honesty?

Let it go all.

I have another weapon in this chamber.

It is a sword of Spain, the ice brook’s temper.

O, here it is.—Uncle, I must come forth.

Look in upon me, then, and speak with me,

Or naked as I am I will assault thee.

Behold, I have a weapon.

A better never did itself sustain

Upon a soldier’s thigh. I have seen the day

That with this little arm and this good sword

I have made my way through more impediments

Than twenty times your stop. But—O vain boast!—

Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.

Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.

Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt

And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.

Do you go back dismayed? ’Tis a lost fear.

Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,

And he retires. Where should Othello go?

Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starred wench,

Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,

This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,

And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?

Even like thy chastity.—O cursèd, cursèd slave!—

Whip me, you devils,

From the possession of this heavenly sight!

Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur,

Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!

O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead! O, O!

That’s he that was Othello. Here I am.

I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.—

If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.

I am not sorry neither. I’d have thee live,

For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.

Why, anything.

An honorable murderer, if you will,

For naught I did in hate, but all in honor.

Ay.

I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.

Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil

Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

Well, thou dost best.

O villain!

O, thou pernicious caitiff!—

How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief

That was my wife’s?

O fool, fool, fool!

Soft you. A word or two before you go.

I have done the state some service, and they know ’t.

No more of that. I pray you in your letters,

When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,

Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,

Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak

Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;

Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,

Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand,

Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away

Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,

Albeit unused to the melting mood,

Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees

Their medicinable gum. Set you down this.

And say besides, that in Aleppo once,

Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk

Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,

I took by th’ throat the circumcisèd dog,

And smote him, thus.

I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,

Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
