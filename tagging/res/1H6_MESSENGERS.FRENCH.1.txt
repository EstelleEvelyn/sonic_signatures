


All hail my lords Which of this princely train

Call you the warlike Talbot for his acts

So much applauded through the realm of France

The virtuous lady Countess of Auvergne

With modesty admiring thy renown

By me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe

To visit her poor castle where she lies

That she may boast she hath beheld the man

Whose glory fills the world with loud report

Madam according as your Ladyship desired

By message craved so is Lord Talbot come

Madam it is

Stay my Lord Talbot for my lady craves

To know the cause of your abrupt departure
