


In the county of Gloucester Justice of Peace

and Coram

Ay and Ratolorum too and a gentleman born

Master Parson who writes himself Armigero

in any bill warrant quittance or obligation

Armigero

All his successors gone before him hath

done 't and all his ancestors that come after him

may They may give the dozen white luces in their

coat

I may quarter coz

Mistress Anne Page She has brown hair

and speaks small like a woman

Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred

pound

I know the young gentlewoman She has

good gifts

How does your fallow greyhound sir I

heard say he was outrun on Cotsall

You'll not confess you'll not confess

Marry sir I have matter in my head against

you and against your cony-catching rascals Bardolph

Nym and Pistol

Ay it is no matter

Ay it is no matter

Where's Simple my man

Can you tell cousin

Ay by these gloves did heor I would I

might never come in mine own great chamber

again elseof seven groats in mill-sixpences

and two Edward shovel-boards that cost me two

shilling and twopence apiece of Yed Miller by

these gloves

By these gloves then 'twas

he

By this hat then he in the red face had it

For though I cannot remember what I did when

you made me drunk yet I am not altogether an

ass

Ay you spake in Latin then too But 'tis no

matter I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again but in

honest civil godly company for this trick If I be

drunk I'll be drunk with those that have the fear of

God and not with drunken knaves

O heaven this is Mistress Anne Page

I had rather than forty shillings I had my

book of Songs and Sonnets here

How now Simple Where have you been I must

wait on myself must I You have not the Book of

Riddles about you have you

Ay sir you shall find me reasonable If it be

so I shall do that that is reason

So I do sir

Nay I will do as my cousin Shallow says I

pray you pardon me He's a Justice of Peace in his

country simple though I stand here

Why if it be so I will marry her upon any

reasonable demands

I hope sir I will do as it shall become one

that would do reason

I will do a greater thing than that upon your

request cousin in any reason

I will marry her sir at your request But if

there be no great love in the beginning yet heaven

may decrease it upon better acquaintance when

we are married and have more occasion to know

one another I hope upon familiarity will grow

more content But if you say Marry her I will

marry her That I am freely dissolved and

dissolutely

Ay or else I would I might be hanged la

No I thank you forsooth heartily I am very

well

I am not ahungry I thank you forsooth

Go sirrah for all you are my man go

wait upon my cousin Shallow A

Justice of Peace sometime may be beholding to his

friend for a man I keep but three men and a boy

yet till my mother be dead But what though Yet

I live like a poor gentleman born

I' faith I'll eat nothing I thank you as much

as though I did

I had rather walk here I thank you I bruised

my shin th' other day with playing at sword and

dagger with a master of fencethree veneys for a

dish of stewed prunesand by my troth I cannot

abide the smell of hot meat since Why do your

dogs bark so Be there bears i' th' town

I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel

at it as any man in England You are afraid if

you see the bear loose are you not

That's meat and drink to me now I have

seen Sackerson loose twenty times and have taken

him by the chain But I warrant you the women

have so cried and shrieked at it that it passed But

women indeed cannot abide 'em they are very ill-favored

rough things

I'll eat nothing I thank you sir

Nay pray you lead the way

Mistress Anne yourself shall go first

Truly I will not go first truly la I will not do

you that wrong

I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome

You do yourself wrong indeed la

Give you good morrow sir

Adieu good Master

Doctor

with Mistress Anne and I would not break with

her for more money than I'll speak of

venturing

Ay forsooth I have spoke with her and we

have a nayword how to know one another I come

to her in white and cry mum she cries budget

and by that we know one another

Whoa ho ho Father Page

Dispatched I'll make the best in Gloucestershire

know on 't Would I were hanged la else

I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress

Anne Page and she's a great lubberly boy If it had

not been i' th' church I would have swinged him

or he should have swinged me If I did not think it

had been Anne Page would I might never stir And

'tis a post-master's boy

What need you tell me that I think so when

I took a boy for a girl If I had been married to him

for all he was in woman's apparel I would not

have had him

I went to her in white and cried mum

and she cried budget as Anne and I had appointed

and yet it was not Anne but a post-master's

boy
