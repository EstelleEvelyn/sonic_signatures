


There's no composition in these news

That gives them credit

And mine a hundred forty

Nay it is possible enough to judgment

I do not so secure me in the error

But the main article I do approve

In fearful sense

Now what's the business

How say you by this change

Nay in all confidence he's not for Rhodes

'Tis certain then for Cyprus

Marcus Luccicos is not he in town

Write from us to him

Post-post-haste Dispatch

Valiant Othello we must straight employ you

Against the general enemy Ottoman

I did not see you Welcome gentle signior

We lacked your counsel and your help tonight

Why what's the matter

Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding

Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself

And you of her the bloody book of law

You shall yourself read in the bitter letter

After your own sense yea though our proper son

Stood in your action

We are very sorry for 't

What in your own part can you say to this

To vouch this is no proof

Without more wider and more overt test

Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods

Of modern seeming do prefer against him

Fetch Desdemona hither

Say it Othello

I think this tale would win my daughter too

Good Brabantio

Take up this mangled matter at the best

Men do their broken weapons rather use

Than their bare hands

Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence

Which as a grise or step may help these lovers

Into your favor

When remedies are past the griefs are ended

By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended

To mourn a mischief that is past and gone

Is the next way to draw new mischief on

What cannot be preserved when fortune takes

Patience her injury a mock'ry makes

The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief

He robs himself that spends a bootless grief

The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes

for Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is

best known to you And though we have there a

substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a

sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer

voice on you You must therefore be content to

slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this

more stubborn and boist'rous expedition

Why at her father's

What would you Desdemona

Be it as you shall privately determine

Either for her stay or going Th' affair cries haste

And speed must answer it

At nine i' th' morning here we'll meet again

Othello leave some officer behind

And he shall our commission bring to you

With such things else of quality and respect

As doth import you

Let it be so

Good night to everyone And noble signior

If virtue no delighted beauty lack

Your son-in-law is far more fair than black
