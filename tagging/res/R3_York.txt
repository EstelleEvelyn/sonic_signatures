


Ay mother but I would not have it so

Grandam one night as we did sit at supper

My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow

More than my brother Ay quoth my uncle Gloucester

Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace

And since methinks I would not grow so fast

Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste

And so no doubt he is my gracious madam

Now by my troth if I had been remembered

I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout

To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine

Marry they say my uncle grew so fast

That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old

'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth

Grandam this would have been a biting jest

Grandam his nurse

If 'twere not she I cannot tell who told me

Well my dread lordso must I call you now

I thank you gentle uncle O my lord

You said that idle weeds are fast in growth

The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far

And therefore is he idle

Then he is more beholding to you than I

I pray you uncle give me this dagger

Of my kind uncle that I know will give

And being but a toy which is no grief to give

A greater gift O that's the sword to it

O then I see you will part but with light gifts

In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay

I weigh it lightly were it heavier

I would that I might thank you as you call me

Little

You mean to bear me not to bear with me

Uncle my brother mocks both you and me

Because that I am little like an ape

He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders

What will you go unto the Tower my lord

I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower

Marry my uncle Clarence' angry ghost

My grandam told me he was murdered there

Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower

Let us be lead within thy bosom Richard

And weigh thee down to ruin shame and death

Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die

Sleep Richmond sleep in peace and wake in joy

Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy

Live and beget a happy race of kings

Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish
