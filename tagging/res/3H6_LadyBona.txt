


Your grant or your denial shall be mine

Yet I confess that often ere this day

When I have heard your king's desert recounted

Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire

Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged

But by thy help to this distressd queen

My quarrel and this English queen's are one

Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly

I wear the willow garland for his sake
