


I think this coming summer the King of

Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which

he justly owes him

Beseech you

You pay a great deal too dear for what's given

freely

Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia

They were trained together in their childhoods

and there rooted betwixt them then such an

affection which cannot choose but branch now

Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities

made separation of their society their encounters

though not personal hath been royally

attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving

embassies that they have seemed to be together

though absent shook hands as over a vast and

embraced as it were from the ends of opposed

winds The heavens continue their loves

I very well agree with you in the hopes of

him It is a gallant childone that indeed physics

the subject makes old hearts fresh They that went

on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to

see him a man

Yes if there were no other excuse why they

should desire to live

Ay my good lord

You had much ado to make his anchor hold

When you cast out it still came home

He would not stay at your petitions made

His business more material

At the good queen's entreaty

Business my lord I think most understand

Bohemia stays here longer

Stays here longer

To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties

Of our most gracious mistress

Be it forbid my lord

My gracious lord

I may be negligent foolish and fearful

In every one of these no man is free

But that his negligence his folly fear

Among the infinite doings of the world

Sometime puts forth In your affairs my lord

If ever I were willful-negligent

It was my folly if industriously

I played the fool it was my negligence

Not weighing well the end if ever fearful

To do a thing where I the issue doubted

Whereof the execution did cry out

Against the non-performance 'twas a fear

Which oft infects the wisest These my lord

Are such allowed infirmities that honesty

Is never free of But beseech your Grace

Be plainer with me let me know my trespass

By its own visage If I then deny it

'Tis none of mine

I would not be a stander-by to hear

My sovereign mistress clouded so without

My present vengeance taken 'Shrew my heart

You never spoke what did become you less

Than this which to reiterate were sin

As deep as that though true

Good my lord be cured

Of this diseased opinion and betimes

For 'tis most dangerous

No no my lord

Who does infect her

Sir my lord

I could do this and that with no rash potion

But with a ling'ring dram that should not work

Maliciously like poison But I cannot

Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress

So sovereignly being honorable I have loved thee

I must believe you sir

I do and will fetch off Bohemia for 't

Provided that when he's removed your Highness

Will take again your queen as yours at first

Even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing

The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms

Known and allied to yours

My lord

Go then and with a countenance as clear

As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia

And with your queen I am his cupbearer

If from me he have wholesome beverage

Account me not your servant

I'll do 't my lord

O miserable lady But for me

What case stand I in I must be the poisoner

Of good Polixenes and my ground to do 't

Is the obedience to a master one

Who in rebellion with himself will have

All that are his so too To do this deed

Promotion follows If I could find example

Of thousands that had struck anointed kings

And flourished after I'd not do 't But since

Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one

Let villainy itself forswear 't I must

Forsake the court To do 't or no is certain

To me a breakneck Happy star reign now

Here comes Bohemia

Hail most royal sir

None rare my lord

I dare not know my lord

There is a sickness

Which puts some of us in distemper but

I cannot name the disease and it is caught

Of you that yet are well

I may not answer

Sir I will tell you

Since I am charged in honor and by him

That I think honorable Therefore mark my counsel

Which must be e'en as swiftly followed as

I mean to utter it or both yourself and me

Cry lost and so goodnight

I am appointed him to murder you

By the King

He thinks nay with all confidence he swears

As he had seen 't or been an instrument

To vice you to 't that you have touched his queen

Forbiddenly

Swear his thought over

By each particular star in heaven and

By all their influences you may as well

Forbid the sea for to obey the moon

As or by oath remove or counsel shake

The fabric of his folly whose foundation

Is piled upon his faith and will continue

The standing of his body

I know not But I am sure 'tis safer to

Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born

If therefore you dare trust my honesty

That lies enclosd in this trunk which you

Shall bear along impawned away tonight

Your followers I will whisper to the business

And will by twos and threes at several posterns

Clear them o' th' city For myself I'll put

My fortunes to your service which are here

By this discovery lost Be not uncertain

For by the honor of my parents I

Have uttered truthwhich if you seek to prove

I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer

Than one condemned by the King's own mouth thereon

His execution sworn

It is in mine authority to command

The keys of all the posterns Please your Highness

To take the urgent hour Come sir away

It is fifteen years since I saw my country

Though I have for the most part been aired abroad

I desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent

king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling

sorrows I might be some allayor I o'erween to

think sowhich is another spur to my departure

Sir it is three days since I saw the Prince

What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown

but I have missingly noted he is of late

much retired from court and is less frequent to his

princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared

I have heard sir of such a man who hath a

daughter of most rare note The report of her is

extended more than can be thought to begin from

such a cottage

I willingly obey your command

I should leave grazing were I of your flock

And only live by gazing

He tells her something

That makes her blood look out Good sooth she is

The queen of curds and cream

This shows a sound affection

Why how now father

Speak ere thou diest

Gracious my lord

You know your father's temper At this time

He will allow no speech which I do guess

You do not purpose to him and as hardly

Will he endure your sight as yet I fear

Then till the fury of his Highness settle

Come not before him

Even he my lord

Be advised

This is desperate sir

O my lord

I would your spirit were easier for advice

Or stronger for your need

He's irremovable

Resolved for flight Now were I happy if

His going I could frame to serve my turn

Save him from danger do him love and honor

Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia

And that unhappy king my master whom

I so much thirst to see

Sir I think

You have heard of my poor services i' th' love

That I have borne your father

Well my lord

If you may please to think I love the King

And through him what's nearest to him which is

Your gracious self embrace but my direction

If your more ponderous and settled project

May suffer alteration On mine honor

I'll point you where you shall have such receiving

As shall become your Highness where you may

Enjoy your mistressfrom the whom I see

There's no disjunction to be made but by

As heavens forfend your ruinmarry her

And with my best endeavors in your absence

Your discontenting father strive to qualify

And bring him up to liking

Have you thought on

A place whereto you'll go

Then list to me

This follows if you will not change your purpose

But undergo this flight make for Sicilia

And there present yourself and your fair princess

For so I see she must be 'fore Leontes

She shall be habited as it becomes

The partner of your bed Methinks I see

Leontes opening his free arms and weeping

His welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness

As 'twere i' th' father's person kisses the hands

Of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him

'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness Th' one

He chides to hell and bids the other grow

Faster than thought or time

Sent by the King your father

To greet him and to give him comforts Sir

The manner of your bearing towards him with

What you as from your father shall deliver

Things known betwixt us three I'll write you down

The which shall point you forth at every sitting

What you must say that he shall not perceive

But that you have your father's bosom there

And speak his very heart

A course more promising

Than a wild dedication of yourselves

To unpathed waters undreamed shores most certain

To miseries enough no hope to help you

But as you shake off one to take another

Nothing so certain as your anchors who

Do their best office if they can but stay you

Where you'll be loath to be Besides you know

Prosperity's the very bond of love

Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together

Affliction alters

Yea say you so

There shall not at your father's house these seven years

Be born another such

I cannot say 'tis pity

She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress

To most that teach

My lord

Fear none of this I think you know my fortunes

Do all lie there It shall be so my care

To have you royally appointed as if

The scene you play were mine For instance sir

That you may know you shall not want one word

Nay but my letters by this means being there

So soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt

Shall satisfy your father

Who have we here

We'll make an instrument of this omit

Nothing may give us aid

How now good fellow Why shak'st thou so

Fear not man Here's no harm intended to thee

Why be so still Here's nobody will steal that

from thee Yet for the outside of thy poverty we

must make an exchange Therefore discase thee

instantlythou must think there's a necessity in

'tand change garments with this gentleman

Though the pennyworth on his side be the worst

yet hold thee there's some boot

Nay prithee dispatch The gentleman is half

flayed already

Unbuckle unbuckle

Fortunate mistresslet my prophecy

Come home to youyou must retire yourself

Into some covert Take your sweetheart's hat

And pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face

Dismantle you and as you can disliken

The truth of your own seeming that you may

For I do fear eyes overto shipboard

Get undescried

No remedy

Have you done there

Nay you shall have no hat

Come lady comeFarewell my friend

What I do next shall be to tell the King

Of this escape and whither they are bound

Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail

To force him after in whose company

I shall re-view Sicilia for whose sight

I have a woman's longing

The swifter speed the better

My lord your sorrow was too sore laid on

Which sixteen winters cannot blow away

So many summers dry Scarce any joy

Did ever so long live no sorrow

But killed itself much sooner

She hangs about his neck

If she pertain to life let her speak too
