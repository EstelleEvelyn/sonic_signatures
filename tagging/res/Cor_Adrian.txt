Nicanor, no?

You had more beard when I last saw you, but

your favor is well approved by your tongue.

What’s the news in Rome? I have a note from the

Volscian state to find you out there. You have well

saved me a day’s journey.

Hath been? Is it ended, then? Our state thinks

not so. They are in a most warlike preparation and

hope to come upon them in the heat of their

division.

Coriolanus banished?

You will be welcome with this intelligence,

Nicanor.

He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus

accidentally to encounter you. You have ended my

business, and I will merrily accompany you home.

A most royal one. The centurions and their

charges, distinctly billeted, already in th’ entertainment,

and to be on foot at an hour’s warning.

You take my part from me, sir. I have the most

cause to be glad of yours.
