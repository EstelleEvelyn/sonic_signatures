


Your faithful subject I a gentleman

Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son

As I suppose to Robert Faulconbridge

A soldier by the honor-giving hand

Of Coeur de Lion knighted in the field

Most certain of one mother mighty king

That is well knownand as I think one father

But for the certain knowledge of that truth

I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother

Of that I doubt as all men's children may

I madam No I have no reason for it

That is my brother's plea and none of mine

The which if he can prove he pops me out

At least from fair five hundred pound a year

Heaven guard my mother's honor and my land

I know not why except to get the land

But once he slandered me with bastardy

But whe'er I be as true begot or no

That still I lay upon my mother's head

But that I am as well begot my liege

Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me

Compare our faces and be judge yourself

If old Sir Robert did beget us both

And were our father and this son like him

O old Sir Robert father on my knee

I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee

Because he hath a half-face like my father

With half that face would he have all my land

A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year

Well sir by this you cannot get my land

Your tale must be how he employed my mother

Of no more force to dispossess me sir

Than was his will to get me as I think

Madam an if my brother had my shape

And I had his Sir Robert's his like him

And if my legs were two such riding-rods

My arms such eel-skins stuffed my face so thin

That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose

Lest men should say Look where three-farthings goes

And to his shape were heir to all this land

Would I might never stir from off this place

I would give it every foot to have this face

I would not be Sir Nob in any case

Brother take you my land I'll take my chance

Your face hath got five hundred pound a year

Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear

Madam I'll follow you unto the death

Our country manners give our betters way

Philip my liege so is my name begun

Philip good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son

Brother by th' mother's side give me your hand

My father gave me honor yours gave land

Now blessd be the hour by night or day

When I was got Sir Robert was away

Madam by chance but not by truth What though

Something about a little from the right

In at the window or else o'er the hatch

Who dares not stir by day must walk by night

And have is have however men do catch

Near or far off well won is still well shot

And I am I howe'er I was begot

Brother adieu good fortune come to thee

For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty

A foot of honor better than I was

But many a many foot of land the worse

Well now can I make any Joan a lady

Good den Sir Richard God-a-mercy fellow

An if his name be George I'll call him Peter

For new-made honor doth forget men's names

'Tis too respective and too sociable

For your conversion Now your traveler

He and his toothpick at my Worship's mess

And when my knightly stomach is sufficed

Why then I suck my teeth and catechize

My pickd man of countries My dear sir

Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin

I shall beseech youthat is Question now

And then comes Answer like an absey-book

O sir says Answer at your best command

At your employment at your service sir

No sir says Question I sweet sir at yours

And so ere Answer knows what Question would

Saving in dialogue of compliment

And talking of the Alps and Apennines

The Pyrenean and the river Po

It draws toward supper in conclusion so

But this is worshipful society

And fits the mounting spirit like myself

For he is but a bastard to the time

That doth not smack of observation

And so am I whether I smack or no

And not alone in habit and device

Exterior form outward accouterment

But from the inward motion to deliver

Sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth

Which though I will not practice to deceive

Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn

For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising

But who comes in such haste in riding robes

What woman post is this Hath she no husband

That will take pains to blow a horn before her

O me 'tis my motherHow now good lady

What brings you here to court so hastily

My brother Robert old Sir Robert's son

Colbrand the Giant that same mighty man

Is it Sir Robert's son that you seek so

James Gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile

Philip Sparrow James

There's toys abroad Anon I'll tell thee more

Madam I was not old Sir Robert's son

Sir Robert might have eat his part in me

Upon Good Friday and ne'er broke his fast

Sir Robert could do wellmarry to confess

Could he get me Sir Robert could not do it

We know his handiwork Therefore good mother

To whom am I beholding for these limbs

Sir Robert never holp to make this leg

Knight knight good mother Basilisco-like

What I am dubbed I have it on my shoulder

But mother I am not Sir Robert's son

I have disclaimed Sir Robert and my land

Legitimation name and all is gone

Then good my mother let me know my father

Some proper man I hope Who was it mother

As faithfully as I deny the devil

Now by this light were I to get again

Madam I would not wish a better father

Some sins do bear their privilege on Earth

And so doth yours Your fault was not your folly

Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose

Subjected tribute to commanding love

Against whose fury and unmatchd force

The aweless lion could not wage the fight

Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand

He that perforce robs lions of their hearts

May easily win a woman's Ay my mother

With all my heart I thank thee for my father

Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well

When I was got I'll send his soul to hell

Come lady I will show thee to my kin

And they shall say when Richard me begot

If thou hadst said him nay it had been sin

Who says it was he lies I say 'twas not

Hear the crier

One that will play the devil sir with you

An he may catch your hide and you alone

You are the hare of whom the proverb goes

Whose valor plucks dead lions by the beard

I'll smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right

Sirrah look to 't I' faith I will i' faith

It lies as sightly on the back of him

As great Alcides' shoes upon an ass

But ass I'll take that burden from your back

Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack

Bastards and else

Some bastards too

Saint George that swinged the dragon and e'er since

Sits on 's horseback at mine hostess' door

Teach us some fence Sirrah were I at home

At your den sirrah with your lioness

I would set an ox head to your lion's hide

And make a monster of you

O tremble for you hear the lion roar

Speed then to take advantage of the field

Ha majesty How high thy glory towers

When the rich blood of kings is set on fire

O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel

The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs

And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men

In undetermined differences of kings

Why stand these royal fronts amazd thus

Cry havoc kings Back to the staind field

You equal potents fiery-kindled spirits

Then let confusion of one part confirm

The other's peace Till then blows blood and death

By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings

And stand securely on their battlements

As in a theater whence they gape and point

At your industrious scenes and acts of death

Your royal presences be ruled by me

Do like the mutines of Jerusalem

Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend

Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town

By east and west let France and England mount

Their battering cannon chargd to the mouths

Till their soul-fearing clamors have brawled down

The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city

I'd play incessantly upon these jades

Even till unfencd desolation

Leave them as naked as the vulgar air

That done dissever your united strengths

And part your mingled colors once again

Turn face to face and bloody point to point

Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth

Out of one side her happy minion

To whom in favor she shall give the day

And kiss him with a glorious victory

How like you this wild counsel mighty states

Smacks it not something of the policy

An if thou hast the mettle of a king

Being wronged as we are by this peevish town

Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery

As we will ours against these saucy walls

And when that we have dashed them to the ground

Why then defy each other and pell-mell

Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell

O prudent discipline From north to south

Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth

I'll stir them to it  Come away away

Here's a stay

That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death

Out of his rags Here's a large mouth indeed

That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas

Talks as familiarly of roaring lions

As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs

What cannoneer begot this lusty blood

He speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce

He gives the bastinado with his tongue

Our ears are cudgeled Not a word of his

But buffets better than a fist of France

Zounds I was never so bethumped with words

Since I first called my brother's father Dad

Drawn in the flattering table of her eye

Hanged in the frowning wrinkle of her brow

And quartered in her heart He doth espy

Himself love's traitor This is pity now

That hanged and drawn and quartered there should be

In such a love so vile a lout as he

Mad world mad kings mad composition

John to stop Arthur's title in the whole

Hath willingly departed with a part

And France whose armor conscience buckled on

Whom zeal and charity brought to the field

As God's own soldier rounded in the ear

With that same purpose-changer that sly devil

That broker that still breaks the pate of faith

That daily break-vow he that wins of all

Of kings of beggars old men young men maids

Who having no external thing to lose

But the word maid cheats the poor maid of that

That smooth-faced gentleman tickling Commodity

Commodity the bias of the world

The world who of itself is peisd well

Made to run even upon even ground

Till this advantage this vile-drawing bias

This sway of motion this Commodity

Makes it take head from all indifferency

From all direction purpose course intent

And this same bias this Commodity

This bawd this broker this all-changing word

Clapped on the outward eye of fickle France

Hath drawn him from his own determined aid

From a resolved and honorable war

To a most base and vile-concluded peace

And why rail I on this Commodity

But for because he hath not wooed me yet

Not that I have the power to clutch my hand

When his fair angels would salute my palm

But for my hand as unattempted yet

Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich

Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail

And say there is no sin but to be rich

And being rich my virtue then shall be

To say there is no vice but beggary

Since kings break faith upon Commodity

Gain be my lord for I will worship thee

And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs

And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs

And hang a calfskin on his recreant limbs

Your breeches best may carry them

Hang nothing but a calfskin most sweet lout

Will 't not be

Will not a calfskin stop that mouth of thine

Old Time the clock-setter that bald sexton Time

Is it as he will Well then France shall rue

Now by my life this day grows wondrous hot

Some airy devil hovers in the sky

And pours down mischief Austria's head lie there

While Philip breathes

My lord I rescued her

Her Highness is in safety fear you not

But on my liege for very little pains

Will bring this labor to an happy end

Bell book and candle shall not drive me back

When gold and silver becks me to come on

I leave your HighnessGrandam I will pray

If ever I remember to be holy

For your fair safety So I kiss your hand

But if you be afeard to hear the worst

Then let the worst unheard fall on your head

How I have sped among the clergymen

The sums I have collected shall express

But as I traveled hither through the land

I find the people strangely fantasied

Possessed with rumors full of idle dreams

Not knowing what they fear but full of fear

And here's a prophet that I brought with me

From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found

With many hundreds treading on his heels

To whom he sung in rude harsh-sounding rhymes

That ere the next Ascension Day at noon

Your Highness should deliver up your crown

The French my lord Men's mouths are full of it

Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury

With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire

And others more going to seek the grave

Of Arthur whom they say is killed tonight

On your suggestion

I will seek them out

The spirit of the time shall teach me speed

Once more today well met distempered lords

The King by me requests your presence straight

Whate'er you think good words I think were best

But there is little reason in your grief

Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now

'Tis true to hurt his master no man's else

It is a damnd and a bloody work

The graceless action of a heavy hand

If that it be the work of any hand

Your sword is bright sir Put it up again

Keep the peace I say

Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury

If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot

Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame

I'll strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime

Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron

That you shall think the devil is come from hell

Here's a good world Knew you of this fair work

Beyond the infinite and boundless reach

Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death

Art thou damned Hubert

Ha I'll tell thee what

Thou 'rt damned as blacknay nothing is so black

Thou art more deep damned than Prince Lucifer

There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell

As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child

If thou didst but consent

To this most cruel act do but despair

And if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread

That ever spider twisted from her womb

Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam

To hang thee on Or wouldst thou drown thyself

Put but a little water in a spoon

And it shall be as all the ocean

Enough to stifle such a villain up

I do suspect thee very grievously

Go bear him in thine arms

I am amazed methinks and lose my way

Among the thorns and dangers of this world

How easy dost thou take all England up

From forth this morsel of dead royalty

The life the right and truth of all this realm

Is fled to heaven and England now is left

To tug and scamble and to part by th' teeth

The unowed interest of proud-swelling state

Now for the bare-picked bone of majesty

Doth doggd war bristle his angry crest

And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace

Now powers from home and discontents at home

Meet in one line and vast confusion waits

As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast

The imminent decay of wrested pomp

Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can

Hold out this tempest Bear away that child

And follow me with speed I'll to the King

A thousand businesses are brief in hand

And heaven itself doth frown upon the land

All Kent hath yielded Nothing there holds out

But Dover Castle London hath received

Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers

Your nobles will not hear you but are gone

To offer service to your enemy

And wild amazement hurries up and down

The little number of your doubtful friends

They found him dead and cast into the streets

An empty casket where the jewel of life

By some damned hand was robbed and ta'en away

So on my soul he did for aught he knew

But wherefore do you droop Why look you sad

Be great in act as you have been in thought

Let not the world see fear and sad distrust

Govern the motion of a kingly eye

Be stirring as the time be fire with fire

Threaten the threat'ner and outface the brow

Of bragging horror So shall inferior eyes

That borrow their behaviors from the great

Grow great by your example and put on

The dauntless spirit of resolution

Away and glister like the god of war

When he intendeth to become the field

Show boldness and aspiring confidence

What shall they seek the lion in his den

And fright him there And make him tremble there

O let it not be said Forage and run

To meet displeasure farther from the doors

And grapple with him ere he come so nigh

O inglorious league

Shall we upon the footing of our land

Send fair-play orders and make compromise

Insinuation parley and base truce

To arms invasive Shall a beardless boy

A cockered silken wanton brave our fields

And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil

Mocking the air with colors idly spread

And find no check Let us my liege to arms

Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace

Or if he do let it at least be said

They saw we had a purpose of defense

Away then with good courage Yet I know

Our party may well meet a prouder foe

According to the fair play of the world

Let me have audience I am sent to speak

My holy lord of Milan from the King

I come to learn how you have dealt for him

And as you answer I do know the scope

And warrant limited unto my tongue

By all the blood that ever fury breathed

The youth says well Now hear our English king

For thus his royalty doth speak in me

He is preparedand reason too he should

This apish and unmannerly approach

This harnessed masque and unadvisd revel

This unheard sauciness and boyish troops

The King doth smile at and is well prepared

To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms

From out the circle of his territories

That hand which had the strength even at your door

To cudgel you and make you take the hatch

To dive like buckets in conceald wells

To crouch in litter of your stable planks

To lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks

To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out

In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake

Even at the crying of your nation's crow

Thinking this voice an armd Englishman

Shall that victorious hand be feebled here

That in your chambers gave you chastisement

No Know the gallant monarch is in arms

And like an eagle o'er his aerie towers

To souse annoyance that comes near his nest

And you degenerate you ingrate revolts

You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb

Of your dear mother England blush for shame

For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids

Like Amazons come tripping after drums

Their thimbles into armd gauntlets change

Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts

To fierce and bloody inclination

No I will speak

Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out

And so shall you being beaten Do but start

An echo with the clamor of thy drum

And even at hand a drum is ready braced

That shall reverberate all as loud as thine

Sound but another and another shall

As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear

And mock the deep-mouthed thunder For at hand

Not trusting to this halting legate here

Whom he hath used rather for sport than need

Is warlike John and in his forehead sits

A bare-ribbed Death whose office is this day

To feast upon whole thousands of the French

And thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt

A friend What art thou

Whither dost thou go

Why may not I demand of thine affairs

As well as thou of mine Hubert I think

Who thou wilt An if thou please

Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think

I come one way of the Plantagenets

Come come Sans compliment what news abroad

Brief then and what's the news

Show me the very wound of this ill news

I am no woman I'll not swoon at it

How did he take it Who did taste to him

Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty

Withhold thine indignation mighty God

And tempt us not to bear above our power

I'll tell thee Hubert half my power this night

Passing these flats are taken by the tide

These Lincoln Washes have devourd them

Myself well mounted hardly have escaped

Away before Conduct me to the King

I doubt he will be dead or ere I come

O I am scalded with my violent motion

And spleen of speed to see your Majesty

The Dauphin is preparing hitherward

Where God He knows how we shall answer him

For in a night the best part of my power

As I upon advantage did remove

Were in the Washes all unwarily

Devourd by the unexpected flood

Art thou gone so I do but stay behind

To do the office for thee of revenge

And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven

As it on Earth hath been thy servant still

Now now you stars that move in your right spheres

Where be your powers Show now your mended faiths

And instantly return with me again

To push destruction and perpetual shame

Out of the weak door of our fainting land

Straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought

The Dauphin rages at our very heels

He will the rather do it when he sees

Ourselves well-sinewd to our defense

Let it be soAnd you my noble prince

With other princes that may best be spared

Shall wait upon your father's funeral

Thither shall it then

And happily may your sweet self put on

The lineal state and glory of the land

To whom with all submission on my knee

I do bequeath my faithful services

And true subjection everlastingly

O let us pay the time but needful woe

Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs

This England never did nor never shall

Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror

But when it first did help to wound itself

Now these her princes are come home again

Come the three corners of the world in arms

And we shall shock them Naught shall make us rue

If England to itself do rest but true
