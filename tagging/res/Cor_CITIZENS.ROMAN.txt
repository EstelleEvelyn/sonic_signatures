Resolved, resolved!

We know ’t, we know ’t!

No more talking on ’t; let it be done. Away, away!

Against him first. He’s a very dog to the

commonalty.

Come, come!

Down with him, down with him!

Let’s hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.

True,

The people are the city.

You so remain.

Yield, Martius, yield!

Down with him, down with him!

He shall, sure on ’t.

No, no, no, no, no!

To th’ rock, to th’ rock with him!

It shall be so, it shall be so! Let him away!

He’s banished, and it shall be so.

It shall be so, it shall be so!

Our enemy is banished; he is gone. Hoo, hoo!

Come, come, let’s see him out at gates! Come!

The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come!

The gods preserve you both!

Now the gods keep you!

Faith, we hear fearful news.
