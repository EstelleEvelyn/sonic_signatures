Nay but this dotage of our general's

O'erflows the measure Those his goodly eyes

That o'er the files and musters of the war

Have glowed like plated Mars now bend now turn

The office and devotion of their view

Upon a tawny front His captain's heart

Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst

The buckles on his breast reneges all temper

And is become the bellows and the fan

To cool a gypsy's lust    Look where they come

Take but good note and you shall see in him

The triple pillar of the world transformed

Into a strumpet's fool Behold and see

Sir sometimes when he is not Antony

He comes too short of that great property

Which still should go with Antony
