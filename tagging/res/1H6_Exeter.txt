


We mourn in black why mourn we not in blood

Henry is dead and never shall revive

Upon a wooden coffin we attend

And Death's dishonorable victory

We with our stately presence glorify

Like captives bound to a triumphant car

What Shall we curse the planets of mishap

That plotted thus our glory's overthrow

Or shall we think the subtle-witted French

Conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him

By magic verses have contrived his end

How were they lost What treachery was used

Were our tears wanting to this funeral

These tidings would call forth her flowing tides

The Dauphin crownd king All fly to him

O whither shall we fly from this reproach

Remember lords your oaths to Henry sworn

Either to quell the Dauphin utterly

Or bring him in obedience to your yoke

To Eltham will I where the young king is

Being ordained his special governor

And for his safety there I'll best devise

Welcome high prince the mighty Duke of York

Ay we may march in England or in France

Not seeing what is likely to ensue

This late dissension grown betwixt the peers

Burns under feignd ashes of forged love

And will at last break out into a flame

As festered members rot but by degree

Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away

So will this base and envious discord breed

And now I fear that fatal prophecy

Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth

Was in the mouth of every sucking babe

That Henry born at Monmouth should win all

And Henry born at Windsor should lose all

Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish

His days may finish ere that hapless time

It grieves his Highness Good my lords be friends

Well didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice

For had the passions of thy heart burst out

I fear we should have seen deciphered there

More rancorous spite more furious raging broils

Than yet can be imagined or supposed

But howsoe'er no simple man that sees

This jarring discord of nobility

This shouldering of each other in the court

This factious bandying of their favorites

But sees it doth presage some ill event

'Tis much when scepters are in children's hands

But more when envy breeds unkind division

There comes the ruin there begins confusion

What is my Lord of Winchester installed

And called unto a cardinal's degree

Then I perceive that will be verified

Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy

If once he come to be a cardinal

He'll make his cap coequal with the crown

Besides his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower

Where Reignier sooner will receive than give
