


God save the King

From Fife great king

Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky

And fan our people cold

Norway himself with terrible numbers

Assisted by that most disloyal traitor

The Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict

Till that Bellona's bridegroom lapped in proof

Confronted him with self-comparisons

Point against point rebellious arm 'gainst arm

Curbing his lavish spirit And to conclude

The victory fell on us

That now Sweno

The Norways' king craves composition

Nor would we deign him burial of his men

Till he disbursd at Saint Colme's Inch

Ten thousand dollars to our general use

I'll see it done

The King hath happily received Macbeth

The news of thy success and when he reads

Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight

His wonders and his praises do contend

Which should be thine or his Silenced with that

In viewing o'er the rest o' th' selfsame day

He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks

Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make

Strange images of death As thick as tale

Came post with post and every one did bear

Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense

And poured them down before him

And for an earnest of a greater honor

He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor

In which addition hail most worthy thane

For it is thine

So all

Well contented

Ha good father

Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act

Threatens his bloody stage By th' clock 'tis day

And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp

Is 't night's predominance or the day's shame

That darkness does the face of earth entomb

When living light should kiss it

And Duncan's horses a thing most strange and certain

Beauteous and swift the minions of their race

Turned wild in nature broke their stalls flung out

Contending 'gainst obedience as they would

Make war with mankind

They did so to th' amazement of mine eyes

That looked upon 't    Here comes the good Macduff

How goes the world sir now

Is 't known who did this more than bloody deed

Alas the day

What good could they pretend

'Gainst nature still

Thriftless ambition that will ravin up

Thine own lives' means Then 'tis most like

The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth

Where is Duncan's body

Will you to Scone

Well I will thither

Farewell father

His absence sir

Lays blame upon his promise Please 't your Highness

To grace us with your royal company

Gentlemen rise His Highness is not well

What sights my lord

You must have patience madam

You know not

Whether it was his wisdom or his fear

My dearest coz

I pray you school yourself But for your husband

He is noble wise judicious and best knows

The fits o' th' season I dare not speak much further

But cruel are the times when we are traitors

And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor

From what we fear yet know not what we fear

But float upon a wild and violent sea

Each way and moveI take my leave of you

Shall not be long but I'll be here again

Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward

To what they were beforeMy pretty cousin

Blessing upon you

I am so much a fool should I stay longer

It would be my disgrace and your discomfort

I take my leave at once

Sir amen

Alas poor country

Almost afraid to know itself It cannot

Be called our mother but our grave where nothing

But who knows nothing is once seen to smile

Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air

Are made not marked where violent sorrow seems

A modern ecstasy The dead man's knell

Is there scarce asked for who and good men's lives

Expire before the flowers in their caps

Dying or ere they sicken

That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker

Each minute teems a new one

Why well

Well too

No they were well at peace when I did leave 'em

When I came hither to transport the tidings

Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumor

Of many worthy fellows that were out

Which was to my belief witnessed the rather

For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot

Now is the time of help Your eye in Scotland

Would create soldiers make our women fight

To doff their dire distresses

Would I could answer

This comfort with the like But I have words

That would be howled out in the desert air

Where hearing should not latch them

No mind that's honest

But in it shares some woe though the main part

Pertains to you alone

Let not your ears despise my tongue forever

Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound

That ever yet they heard

Your castle is surprised your wife and babes

Savagely slaughtered To relate the manner

Were on the quarry of these murdered deer

To add the death of you

Wife children servants all that could be found

I have said

Your son my lord has paid a soldier's debt

He only lived but till he was a man

The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed

In the unshrinking station where he fought

But like a man he died

Ay and brought off the field Your cause of sorrow

Must not be measured by his worth for then

It hath no end

Ay on the front

Hail King of Scotland
