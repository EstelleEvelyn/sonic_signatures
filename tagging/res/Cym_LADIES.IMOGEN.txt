
The Queen, madam,

Desires your Highness’ company.

Please you, madam.

Almost midnight, madam.

Who’s there that knocks?

No more?

That’s more

Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours

Can justly boast of. What’s your Lordship’s pleasure?

Ay,

To keep her chamber.

How, my good name? Or to report of you

What I shall think is good?    The Princess.
