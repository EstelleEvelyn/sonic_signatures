And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?

This small inheritance my father left me

Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.

I seek not to wax great by others’ waning,

Or gather wealth, I care not with what envy.

Sufficeth that I have maintains my state

And sends the poor well pleasèd from my gate.

Why, rude companion, whatsoe’er thou be,

I know thee not. Why, then, should I betray thee?

Is ’t not enough to break into my garden

And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,

Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,

But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?

Nay, it shall ne’er be said, while England stands,

That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,

Took odds to combat a poor famished man.

Oppose thy steadfast gazing eyes to mine;

See if thou canst outface me with thy looks.

Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;

Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,

Thy leg a stick comparèd with this truncheon.

My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;

And if mine arm be heavèd in the air,

Thy grave is digged already in the earth.

As for words, whose greatness answers words,

Let this my sword report what speech forbears.

Is ’t Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?

Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,

And hang thee o’er my tomb when I am dead.

Ne’er shall this blood be wipèd from thy point,

But thou shalt wear it as a herald’s coat

To emblaze the honor that thy master got.

How much thou wrong’st me, heaven be my judge!

Die, damnèd wretch, the curse of her that bare thee!

And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,

So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.

Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels

Unto a dunghill, which shall be thy grave,

And there cut off thy most ungracious head,

Which I will bear in triumph to the King,

Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

If one so rude and of so mean condition

May pass into the presence of a king,

Lo, I present your Grace a traitor’s head,

The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.

I was, an ’t like your Majesty.

Alexander Iden, that’s my name,

A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.

May Iden live to merit such a bounty,

And never live but true unto his liege!
