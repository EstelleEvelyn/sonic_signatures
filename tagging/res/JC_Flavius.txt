Is this a holiday What know you not

Being mechanical you ought not walk

Upon a laboring day without the sign

Of your professionSpeak what trade art thou

What trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what trade

Thou art a cobbler art thou

But wherefore art not in thy shop today

Why dost thou lead these men about the streets

Go go good countrymen and for this fault

Assemble all the poor men of your sort

Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears

Into the channel till the lowest stream

Do kiss the most exalted shores of all

See whe'er their basest mettle be not moved

They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness

Go you down that way towards the Capitol

This way will I Disrobe the images

If you do find them decked with ceremonies

It is no matter Let no images

Be hung with Caesar's trophies I'll about

And drive away the vulgar from the streets

So do you too where you perceive them thick

These growing feathers plucked from Caesar's wing

Will make him fly an ordinary pitch

Who else would soar above the view of men

And keep us all in servile fearfulness
