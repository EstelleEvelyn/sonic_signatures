Turn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.

What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word

As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.

Have at thee, coward!

This, by his voice, should be a Montague.—

Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave

Come hither covered with an antic face

To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,

To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,

A villain that is hither come in spite

To scorn at our solemnity this night.

’Tis he, that villain Romeo.

It fits when such a villain is a guest.

I’ll not endure him.

Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.

Patience perforce with willful choler meeting

Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.

I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,

Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt’rest gall.

Follow me close, for I will speak to them.—

Gentlemen, good e’en. A word with one of you.

You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an

you will give me occasion.

Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford

No better term than this: thou art a villain.

Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries

That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.

What wouldst thou have with me?

I am for you.

Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here

Shalt with him hence.
