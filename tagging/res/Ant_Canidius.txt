Why will

My lord do so

Ay and to wage this battle at Pharsalia

Where Caesar fought with Pompey But these offers

Which serve not for his vantage he shakes off

And so should you

Soldier thou art but his whole action grows

Not in the power on 't So our leader's led

And we are women's men

Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius

Publicola and Caelius are for sea

But we keep whole by land This speed of Caesar's

Carries beyond belief

Who's his lieutenant hear you

Well I know the man

With news the time's in labor and throws forth

Each minute some

Our fortune on the sea is out of breath

And sinks most lamentably Had our general

Been what he knew himself it had gone well

O he has given example for our flight

Most grossly by his own

Toward Peloponnesus are they fled

To Caesar will I render

My legions and my horse Six kings already

Show me the way of yielding
