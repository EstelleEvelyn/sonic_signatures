That would hang us every mother's son

By 'r lakin a parlous fear

Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion

Therefore another prologue must tell he is not

a lion

Doth the moon shine that night we play our

play

You can never bring in a wall What say you

Bottom

O Bottom thou art changed What do I see on

thee

In this same interlude it doth befall

That I one Snout by name present a wall

And such a wall as I would have you think

That had in it a crannied hole or chink

Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisbe

Did whisper often very secretly

This loam this roughcast and this stone doth show

That I am that same wall The truth is so

And this the cranny is right and sinister

Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper

Thus have I Wall my part dischargd so

And being done thus Wall away doth go
