For my part I care not I say little but when time

shall serve there shall be smiles but that shall be as

it may I dare not fight but I will wink and hold out

mine iron It is a simple one but what though It

will toast cheese and it will endure cold as another

man's sword will and there's an end

Faith I will live so long as I may that's the

certain of it and when I cannot live any longer I

will do as I may That is my rest that is the

rendezvous of it

I cannot tell Things must be as they may Men

may sleep and they may have their throats about

them at that time and some say knives have edges

It must be as it may Though patience be a tired

mare yet she will plod There must be conclusions

Well I cannot tell

Pish

Will you shog off I would have you

solus

I am not Barbason you cannot conjure me I

have an humor to knock you indifferently well If

you grow foul with me Pistol I will scour you with

my rapier as I may in fair terms If you would walk

off I would prick your guts a little in good terms as

I may and that's the humor of it

I will cut thy throat one time or other

in fair terms that is the humor of it

You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at

betting

That now I will have that's the humor of it

I shall have my noble

Well then that's the humor of 't

The King hath run bad humors on the knight

that's the even of it

The King is a good king but it must be as it may

he passes some humors and careers

They say he cried out of sack

Shall we shog The King will be gone from

Southampton

I cannot kiss that is the humor of it But adieu

Pray thee corporal stay The knocks are too hot

and for mine own part I have not a case of lives

The humor of it is too hot that is the very plainsong

of it

These be good humors Your Honor

wins bad humors
