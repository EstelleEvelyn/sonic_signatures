


You spotted snakes with double tongue

Thorny hedgehogs be not seen

Newts and blindworms do no wrong

Come not near our Fairy Queen

Philomel with melody

Sing in our sweet lullaby

Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby

Never harm

Nor spell nor charm

Come our lovely lady nigh

So good night with lullaby

Weaving spiders come not here

Hence you long-legged spinners hence

Beetles black approach not near

Worm nor snail do no offence

Philomel with melody

Sing in our sweet lullaby

Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby

Never harm

Nor spell nor charm

Come our lovely lady nigh

So good night with lullaby
