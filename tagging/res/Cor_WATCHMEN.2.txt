


Stand and go back

You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before

You'll speak with Coriolanus

Howsoever you have been his liar as

you say you have I am one that telling true under

him must say you cannot pass Therefore go back

'Tis a spell you see of much power You

know the way home again

What cause do you think I have to

swoon

The worthy fellow is our general He's

the rock the oak not to be wind-shaken
