


What work 's my countrymen in hand Where go you

With bats and clubs The matter Speak I pray you

Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbors

Will you undo yourselves

I tell you friends most charitable care

Have the patricians of you For your wants

Your suffering in this dearth you may as well

Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them

Against the Roman state whose course will on

The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs

Of more strong link asunder than can ever

Appear in your impediment For the dearth

The gods not the patricians make it and

Your knees to them not arms must help Alack

You are transported by calamity

Thither where more attends you and you slander

The helms o' th' state who care for you like fathers

When you curse them as enemies

Either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious

Or be accused of folly I shall tell you

A pretty tale It may be you have heard it

But since it serves my purpose I will venture

To stale 't a little more

There was a time when all the body's members

Rebelled against the belly thus accused it

That only like a gulf it did remain

I' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive

Still cupboarding the viand never bearing

Like labor with the rest where th' other instruments

Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel

And mutually participate did minister

Unto the appetite and affection common

Of the whole body The belly answered

Sir I shall tell you With a kind of smile

Which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus

For look you I may make the belly smile

As well as speakit tauntingly replied

To th' discontented members the mutinous parts

That envied his receipt even so most fitly

As you malign our senators for that

They are not such as you

What then

'Fore me this fellow speaks What then What then

Well what then

I will tell you

If you'll bestow a smallof what you have little

Patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answer

Note me this good friend

Your most grave belly was deliberate

Not rash like his accusers and thus answered

True is it my incorporate friends quoth he

That I receive the general food at first

Which you do live upon and fit it is

Because I am the storehouse and the shop

Of the whole body But if you do remember

I send it through the rivers of your blood

Even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th' brain

And through the cranks and offices of man

The strongest nerves and small inferior veins

From me receive that natural competency

Whereby they live And though that all at once

You my good friendsthis says the belly mark me

Though all at once cannot

See what I do deliver out to each

Yet I can make my audit up that all

From me do back receive the flour of all

And leave me but the bran What say you to 't

The senators of Rome are this good belly

And you the mutinous members For examine

Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly

Touching the weal o' th' common you shall find

No public benefit which you receive

But it proceeds or comes from them to you

And no way from yourselves What do you think

You the great toe of this assembly

For that being one o' th' lowest basest poorest

Of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost

Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run

Lead'st first to win some vantage

But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs

Rome and her rats are at the point of battle

The one side must have bale    Hail noble Martius

For corn at their own rates whereof they say

The city is well stored

Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded

For though abundantly they lack discretion

Yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you

What says the other troop

What is granted them

This is strange

O true bred

The augurer tells me we shall have news

tonight

Not according to the prayer of the people

for they love not Martius

Pray you who does the wolf love

Ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians

would the noble Martius

He's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb

You two are old men tell me one thing that I shall

ask you

In what enormity is Martius poor in that

you two have not in abundance

This is strange now Do you two know how

you are censured here in the city I mean of us o'

th' right-hand file do you

Because you talk of pride now will you not

be angry

Why 'tis no great matter for a very little

thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience

Give your dispositions the reins and be

angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it

as a pleasure to you in being so You blame Martius

for being proud

I know you can do very little alone for

your helps are many or else your actions would

grow wondrous single Your abilities are too infantlike

for doing much alone You talk of pride O

that you could turn your eyes toward the napes

of your necks and make but an interior survey of

your good selves O that you could

Why then you should discover a brace of

unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias

fools as any in Rome

I am known to be a humorous patrician and

one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of

allaying Tiber in 't said to be something imperfect

in favoring the first complaint hasty and tinder-like

upon too trivial motion one that converses

more with the buttock of the night than with the

forehead of the morning What I think I utter

and spend my malice in my breath Meeting two

such wealsmen as you areI cannot call you

Lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my

palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I cannot

say your Worships have delivered the matter

well when I find the ass in compound with the

major part of your syllables And though I must

be content to bear with those that say you are reverend

grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you

have good faces If you see this in the map of my

microcosm follows it that I am known well enough

too What harm can your bisson conspectuities

glean out of this character if I be known well

enough too

You know neither me yourselves nor anything

You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps

and legs You wear out a good wholesome forenoon

in hearing a cause between an orange-wife

and a faucet-seller and then rejourn the controversy

of threepence to a second day of audience

When you are hearing a matter between party and

party if you chance to be pinched with the colic

you make faces like mummers set up the bloody

flag against all patience and in roaring for a

chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding

the more entangled by your hearing All the peace

you make in their cause is calling both the parties

knaves You are a pair of strange ones

Our very priests must become mockers if

they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as

you are When you speak best unto the purpose it

is not worth the wagging of your beards and your

beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to

stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an

ass's packsaddle Yet you must be saying Martius is

proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all

your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure

some of the best of 'em were hereditary

hangmen Good e'en to your Worships More of

your conversation would infect my brain being

the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be

bold to take my leave of you

How now my as fair as noble ladiesand the

moon were she earthly no noblerwhither do

you follow your eyes so fast

Ha Martius coming home

Take my cap Jupiter and I thank thee

Hoo Martius coming

home

I will make my very house reel tonight A

letter for me

A letter for me It gives me an estate of

seven years' health in which time I will make a lip

at the physician The most sovereign prescription

in Galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative

of no better report than a horse drench Is he not

wounded He was wont to come home wounded

So do I too if it be not too much Brings he

victory in his pocket the wounds become him

Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly

And 'twas time for him too I'll warrant him

that An he had stayed by him I would not have

been so 'fidiused for all the chests in Corioles and

the gold that's in them Is the Senate possessed of

this

Wondrous Ay I warrant you and not without

his true purchasing

True I'll be sworn they are true Where is

he wounded God save your

good Worships Martius is coming home he has

more cause to be proudWhere is he wounded

One i' th' neck and two i' th' thighthere's

nine that I know

Now it's twenty-seven Every gash was an

enemy's grave Hark the

trumpets

Welcome to Rome renownd Coriolanus

Now the gods crown thee

A hundred thousand welcomes I could weep

And I could laugh I am light and heavy Welcome

A curse begin at very root on 's heart

That is not glad to see thee You are three

That Rome should dote on yet by the faith of men

We have some old crab trees here at home that will not

Be grafted to your relish Yet welcome warriors

We call a nettle but a nettle and

The faults of fools but folly

Having determined of the Volsces and

To send for Titus Lartius it remains

As the main point of this our after-meeting

To gratify his noble service that

Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you

Most reverend and grave elders to desire

The present consul and last general

In our well-found successes to report

A little of that worthy work performed

By Martius Caius Coriolanus whom

We met here both to thank and to remember

With honors like himself

That's off that's off

I would you rather had been silent Please you

To hear Cominius speak

He loves your people

But tie him not to be their bedfellow

Worthy Cominius speak  Nay keep your place

Pray now sit down

Masters of the people

Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter

That's thousand to one good onewhen you now see

He had rather venture all his limbs for honor

Than one on 's ears to hear itProceed Cominius

Worthy man

He's right noble

Let him be called for

The Senate Coriolanus are well pleased

To make thee consul

It then remains

That you do speak to the people

Put them not to 't

Pray you go fit you to the custom and

Take to you as your predecessors have

Your honor with your form

Do not stand upon 't

We recommend to you tribunes of the people

Our purpose to them and to our noble consul

Wish we all joy and honor

O sir you are not right Have you not known

The worthiest men have done 't

O me the gods

You must not speak of that You must desire them

To think upon you

You'll mar all

I'll leave you Pray you speak to 'em I pray you

In wholesome manner

You have stood your limitation and the Tribunes

Endue you with the people's voice Remains

That in th' official marks invested you

Anon do meet the Senate

I'll keep you companyWill you along

The matter

Be calm be calm

Let's be calm

Not now not now

Well no more

What what His choler

Well well no more of that

Come enough

On both sides more respect

Peace peace peace Stay hold peace

What is about to be I am out of breath

Confusion's near I cannot speak You tribunes

To th' peopleCoriolanus patience

Speak good Sicinius

Fie fie fie

This is the way to kindle not to quench

And so are like to do

Hear me one word

Beseech you tribunes hear me but a word

Be that you seem truly your country's friend

And temp'rately proceed to what you would

Thus violently redress

Down with that swordTribunes withdraw awhile

Help Martius help

You that be noble help him young and old

Go get you to your house Begone away

All will be naught else

Shall it be put to that

For 'tis a sore upon us

You cannot tent yourself Begone beseech you

Begone

Put not your worthy rage into your tongue

One time will owe another

I could myself

Take up a brace o' th' best of them yea the two tribunes

Pray you begone

I'll try whether my old wit be in request

With those that have but little This must be patched

With cloth of any color

His nature is too noble for the world

He would not flatter Neptune for his trident

Or Jove for 's power to thunder His heart's his mouth

What his breast forges that his tongue must vent

And being angry does forget that ever

He heard the name of death Here's goodly work

I would they were in Tiber What the vengeance

Could he not speak 'em fair

You worthy tribunes

Sir sir

Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt

With modest warrant

Hear me speak

As I do know the Consul's worthiness

So can I name his faults

The consul Coriolanus

If by the Tribunes' leave and yours good people

I may be heard I would crave a word or two

The which shall turn you to no further harm

Than so much loss of time

Now the good gods forbid

That our renownd Rome whose gratitude

Towards her deservd children is enrolled

In Jove's own book like an unnatural dam

Should now eat up her own

O he's a limb that has but a disease

Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy

What has he done to Rome that's worthy death

Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost

Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath

By many an ouncehe dropped it for his country

And what is left to lose it by his country

Were to us all that do 't and suffer it

A brand to th' end o' th' world

One word more one word

This tiger-footed rage when it shall find

The harm of unscanned swiftness will too late

Tie leaden pounds to 's heels Proceed by process

Lest partiesas he is belovedbreak out

And sack great Rome with Romans

Consider this he has been bred i' th' wars

Since he could draw a sword and is ill schooled

In bolted language meal and bran together

He throws without distinction Give me leave

I'll go to him and undertake to bring him

Where he shall answer by a lawful form

In peace to his utmost peril

I'll bring him to you

Let me desire your company He must come

Or what is worst will follow

Come come you have been too rough something too rough

You must return and mend it

Well said noble woman

Before he should thus stoop to th' herdbut that

The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic

For the whole stateI would put mine armor on

Which I can scarcely bear

Return to th' Tribunes

Repent what you have spoke

A good demand

Noble lady

Come go with us speak fair You may salve so

Not what is dangerous present but the loss

Of what is past

This but done

Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours

For they have pardons being asked as free

As words to little purpose

Only fair speech

Ay but mildly

Calmly I do beseech you

A noble wish

Lo citizens he says he is content

The warlike service he has done consider Think

Upon the wounds his body bears which show

Like graves i' th' holy churchyard

Consider further

That when he speaks not like a citizen

You find him like a soldier Do not take

His rougher accents for malicious sounds

But as I say such as become a soldier

Rather than envy you

Nay temperately Your promise

Is this the promise that you made your mother

That's worthily

As any ear can hear Come let's not weep

If I could shake off but one seven years

From these old arms and legs by the good gods

I'd with thee every foot

Peace peace Be not so loud

Come come peace

You have told them home

And by my troth you have cause You'll sup with me

Fie fie fie

Hail to you both

All's well and might have been much better if

He could have temporized

Nay I hear nothing

His mother and his wife hear nothing from him

I think not so

'Tis Aufidius

Who hearing of our Martius' banishment

Thrusts forth his horns again into the world

Which were inshelled when Martius stood for Rome

And durst not once peep out

Cannot be

We have record that very well it can

And three examples of the like hath been

Within my age But reason with the fellow

Before you punish him where he heard this

Lest you shall chance to whip your information

And beat the messenger who bids beware

Of what is to be dreaded

This is unlikely

He and Aufidius can no more atone

Than violent'st contrariety

What news What news

What's the news What's the news

Pray now your news

You have made fair work I fear mePray your news

If Martius should be joined with Volscians

You have made good work

You and your apron-men you that stood so much

Upon the voice of occupation and

The breath of garlic eaters

As Hercules did shake down mellow fruit

You have made fair work

We are all undone unless

The noble man have mercy

'Tis true

If he were putting to my house the brand

That should consume it I have not the face

To say Beseech you ceaseYou have made fair hands

You and your crafts You have crafted fair

How Was 't we We loved him but like beasts

And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters

Who did hoot him out o' th' city

Here come the clusters

And is Aufidius with him You are they

That made the air unwholesome when you cast

Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at

Coriolanus' exile Now he's coming

And not a hair upon a soldier's head

Which will not prove a whip As many coxcombs

As you threw caps up will he tumble down

And pay you for your voices 'Tis no matter

If he could burn us all into one coal

We have deserved it

You have made good work you and your cry

Shall 's to the Capitol

No I'll not go You hear what he hath said

Which was sometime his general who loved him

In a most dear particular He called me father

But what o' that Go you that banished him

A mile before his tent fall down and knee

The way into his mercy Nay if he coyed

To hear Cominius speak I'll keep at home

Do you hear

 Why so you have made good work

A pair of tribunes that have wracked Rome

To make coals cheap A noble memory

Very well

Could he say less

For one poor grain or two

I am one of those His mother wife his child

And this brave fellow too we are the grains

You are the musty chaff and you are smelt

Above the moon We must be burnt for you

No I'll not meddle

What should I do

Well and say that Martius

Return me as Cominius is returned unheard

What then But as a discontented friend

Grief-shot with his unkindness Say 't be so

I'll undertake 't

I think he'll hear me Yet to bite his lip

And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me

He was not taken well he had not dined

The veins unfilled our blood is cold and then

We pout upon the morning are unapt

To give or to forgive but when we have stuffed

These pipes and these conveyances of our blood

With wine and feeding we have suppler souls

Than in our priestlike fasts Therefore I'll watch him

Till he be dieted to my request

And then I'll set upon him

Good faith I'll prove him

Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge

Of my success

You guard like men 'tis well But by your leave

I am an officer of state and come

To speak with Coriolanus

From Rome

Good my friends

If you have heard your general talk of Rome

And of his friends there it is lots to blanks

My name hath touched your ears It is Menenius

I tell thee fellow

Thy general is my lover I have been

The book of his good acts whence men have read

His fame unparalleled happily amplified

For I have ever verified my friends

Of whom he's chiefwith all the size that verity

Would without lapsing suffer Nay sometimes

Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground

I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise

Have almost stamped the leasing Therefore fellow

I must have leave to pass

Prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius

always factionary on the party of your

general

Has he dined can'st thou tell For I would

not speak with him till after dinner

I am as thy general is

Sirrah if thy captain knew I were here he

would use me with estimation

I mean thy general

Nay but fellow fellow

Now you companion I'll

say an errand for you You shall know now that I

am in estimation you shall perceive that a Jack

guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus

Guess but by my entertainment with him

if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging or of some

death more long in spectatorship and crueler in

suffering behold now presently and swoon for

what's to come upon thee The

glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular

prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old

father Menenius does O my son my son

Thou art preparing fire for us look thee

here's water to quench it I was hardly moved to

come to thee but being assured none but myself

could move thee I have been blown out of your

gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome

and thy petitionary countrymen The good gods

assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon

this varlet here this who like a block hath denied

my access to thee

How Away

I neither care for th' world nor your general

For such things as you I can scarce think

there's any you're so slight He that hath a will to

die by himself fears it not from another Let your

general do his worst For you be that you are

long and your misery increase with your age I say

to you as I was said to away

See you yond coign o' th' Capitol yond

cornerstone

If it be possible for you to displace it with

your little finger there is some hope the ladies of

Rome especially his mother may prevail with

him But I say there is no hope in 't Our throats

are sentenced and stay upon execution

There is differency between a grub and a

butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub This Martius

is grown from man to dragon He has wings

he's more than a creeping thing

So did he me and he no more remembers

his mother now than an eight-year-old horse The

tartness of his face sours ripe grapes When he

walks he moves like an engine and the ground

shrinks before his treading He is able to pierce a

corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum

is a battery He sits in his state as a thing made for

Alexander What he bids be done is finished with

his bidding He wants nothing of a god but eternity

and a heaven to throne in

I paint him in the character Mark what

mercy his mother shall bring from him There is

no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male

tiger That shall our poor city find and all this is

long of you

No in such a case the gods will not be good

unto us When we banished him we respected not

them and he returning to break our necks they

respect not us

This is good news

I will go meet the ladies This Volumnia

Is worth of consuls senators patricians

A city full of tribunes such as you

A sea and land full You have prayed well today

This morning for ten thousand of your throats

I'd not have given a doit Hark how they joy
