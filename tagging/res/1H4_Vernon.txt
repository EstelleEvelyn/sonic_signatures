


Pray God my news be worth a welcome lord

The Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong

Is marching hitherwards with him Prince John

And further I have learned

The King himself in person is set forth

Or hitherwards intended speedily

With strong and mighty preparation

All furnished all in arms

All plumed like estridges that with the wind

Bated like eagles having lately bathed

Glittering in golden coats like images

As full of spirit as the month of May

And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer

Wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls

I saw young Harry with his beaver on

His cuisses on his thighs gallantly armed

Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury

And vaulted with such ease into his seat

As if an angel dropped down from the clouds

To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus

And witch the world with noble horsemanship

There is more news

I learned in Worcester as I rode along

He cannot draw his power this fourteen days

To thirty thousand

Not a whit

So do we

Do not my lord

Do me no slander Douglas By my life

And I dare well maintain it with my life

If well-respected honor bid me on

I hold as little counsel with weak fear

As you my lord or any Scot that this day lives

Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle

Which of us fears

Content

Come come it may not be I wonder much

Being men of such great leading as you are

That you foresee not what impediments

Drag back our expedition Certain horse

Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up

Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today

And now their pride and mettle is asleep

Their courage with hard labor tame and dull

That not a horse is half the half of himself

'Twere best he did

Deliver what you will I'll say 'tis so

Here comes your cousin

No by my soul I never in my life

Did hear a challenge urged more modestly

Unless a brother should a brother dare

To gentle exercise and proof of arms

He gave you all the duties of a man

Trimmed up your praises with a princely tongue

Spoke your deservings like a chronicle

Making you ever better than his praise

By still dispraising praise valued with you

And which became him like a prince indeed

He made a blushing cital of himself

And chid his truant youth with such a grace

As if he mastered there a double spirit

Of teaching and of learning instantly

There did he pause but let me tell the world

If he outlive the envy of this day

England did never owe so sweet a hope

So much misconstrued in his wantonness
