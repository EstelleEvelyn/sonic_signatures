


Gentlemen importune me no farther

For how I firmly am resolved you know

That is not to bestow my youngest daughter

Before I have a husband for the elder

If either of you both love Katherine

Because I know you well and love you well

Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure

Gentlemen that I may soon make good

What I have saidBianca get you in

And let it not displease thee good Bianca

For I will love thee ne'er the less my girl

Gentlemen content you I am resolved

Go in Bianca

And for I know she taketh most delight

In music instruments and poetry

Schoolmasters will I keep within my house

Fit to instruct her youth If you Hortensio

Or Signior Gremio you know any such

Prefer them hither For to cunning men

I will be very kind and liberal

To mine own children in good bringing up

And so farewellKatherine you may stay

For I have more to commune with Bianca

Why how now dame whence grows this insolence

Bianca stand asidePoor girl she weeps

Go ply thy needle meddle not with her

For shame thou hilding of a devilish spirit

Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee

When did she cross thee with a bitter word

What in my sightBianca get thee in

Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I

But who comes here

Good morrow neighbor GremioGod

save you gentlemen

I have a daughter sir called Katherina

You're welcome sir and he for your good sake

But for my daughter Katherine this I know

She is not for your turn the more my grief

Mistake me not I speak but as I find

Whence are you sir What may I call your name

I know him well You are welcome for his sake

A thousand thanks Signior GremioWelcome

good Cambio But

gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger May I

be so bold to know the cause of your coming

Lucentio is your name Of whence I pray

A mighty man of Pisa By report

I know him well You are very welcome sir

Take you the lute and you the set of books

You shall go see your pupils presently

Holla within    Sirrah lead these gentlemen

To my daughters and tell them both

These are their tutors Bid them use them well

We will go walk a little in the orchard

And then to dinner You are passing welcome

And so I pray you all to think yourselves

After my death the one half of my lands

And in possession twenty thousand crowns

Ay when the special thing is well obtained

That is her love for that is all in all

Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed

But be thou armed for some unhappy words

How now my friend why dost thou look so pale

What will my daughter prove a good musician

Why then thou canst not break her to the lute

Well go with me and be not so discomfited

Proceed in practice with my younger daughter

She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns

Signior Petruchio will you go with us

Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you

Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter

Why how now daughter Katherine In your dumps

I know not what to say but give me your hands

God send you joy Petruchio 'Tis a match

Faith gentlemen now I play a merchant's part

And venture madly on a desperate mart

The gain I seek is quiet in the match

Content you gentlemen I will compound this strife

'Tis deeds must win the prize and he of both

That can assure my daughter greatest dower

Shall have my Bianca's love

Say Signior Gremio what can you assure her

I must confess your offer is the best

And let your father make her the assurance

She is your own else you must pardon me

If you should die before him where's her dower

Well gentlemen I am thus resolved

On Sunday next you know

My daughter Katherine is to be married

Now on the Sunday following shall Bianca

Be bride to you if you make this assurance

If not to Signior Gremio

And so I take my leave and thank you both

Signior Lucentio this is the 'pointed day

That Katherine and Petruchio should be married

And yet we hear not of our son-in-law

What will be said What mockery will it be

To want the bridegroom when the priest attends

To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage

What says Lucentio to this shame of ours

Go girl I cannot blame thee now to weep

For such an injury would vex a very saint

Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor

Is it new and old too How may that be

Is he come

What then

When will he be here

Who comes with him

I am glad he's come howsoe'er he comes

Didst thou not say he comes

Ay that Petruchio came

Why that's all one

You are welcome sir

And yet you halt not

Why sir you know this is your wedding day

First were we sad fearing you would not come

Now sadder that you come so unprovided

Fie doff this habit shame to your estate

An eyesore to our solemn festival

But thus I trust you will not marry her

I'll after him and see the event of this

Is 't possible you will away tonight

Nay let them go A couple of quiet ones

Neighbors and friends though bride and bridegroom wants

For to supply the places at the table

You know there wants no junkets at the feast

Lucentio you shall supply the bridegroom's place

And let Bianca take her sister's room

She shall Lucentio Come gentlemen let's go

Sir pardon me in what I have to say

Your plainness and your shortness please me well

Right true it is your son Lucentio here

Doth love my daughter and she loveth him

Or both dissemble deeply their affections

And therefore if you say no more than this

That like a father you will deal with him

And pass my daughter a sufficient dower

The match is made and all is done

Your son shall have my daughter with consent

Not in my house Lucentio for you know

Pitchers have ears and I have many servants

Besides old Gremio is heark'ning still

And happily we might be interrupted

It likes me wellCambio hie you home

And bid Bianca make her ready straight

And if you will tell what hath happend

Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua

And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife

I follow you

What is the man lunatic

You mistake sir you mistake sir Pray what

do you think is his name

Talk not Signior Gremio I say he shall go to

prison

Away with the dotard to the jail with him

How hast thou offended

Where is Lucentio

Why tell me is not this my Cambio

But do you hear sir have you married my

daughter without asking my goodwill

And I to sound the depth of this knavery

Padua affords this kindness son Petruchio

How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks

O O Petruchio Tranio hits you now

Now in good sadness son Petruchio

I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all

Son I'll be your half Bianca comes

Now by my holidam here comes Katherina

Now fair befall thee good Petruchio

The wager thou hast won and I will add

Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns

Another dowry to another daughter

For she is changed as she had never been
