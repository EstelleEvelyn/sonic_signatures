


I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full

weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished

father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father,

so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught

my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou,

if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously

tempered as mine is to thee.

You know my father hath no child but I, nor

none is like to have; and truly, when he dies, thou

shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from

thy father perforce, I will render thee again in

affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break

that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet

Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.

Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but

love no man in good earnest, nor no further in

sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou

mayst in honor come off again.

Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune

from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be

bestowed equally.

’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce

makes honest, and those that she makes honest she

makes very ill-favoredly.

No? When Nature hath made a fair creature,

may she not by fortune fall into the fire?

Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune,

hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the

argument?

Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither,

but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too

dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent

this natural for our whetstone, for always the dullness

of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.

How now, wit, whither wander you?

Were you made the messenger?

How prove you that in the great heap of your

knowledge?

By our beards (if we had them), thou art.

Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?

My father’s love is enough to honor him.

Enough. Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped

for taxation one of these days.

By my troth, thou sayest true. For, since the little

wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery

that wise men have makes a great show. Here

comes Monsieur Le Beau.

Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their

young.

All the better. We shall be the more

marketable.—Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s

the news?

Sport? Of what color?

Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.

Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.

I could match this beginning with an old tale.

Or I, I promise thee.

Yonder sure they are coming. Let us now stay

and see it.

Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.

Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for

your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s

strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew

yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure

would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.

We pray you for your own sake to embrace your

own safety and give over this attempt.

And mine, to eke out hers.

Your heart’s desires be with you.

I would I were invisible, to catch the strong

fellow by the leg.

If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who

should down.

Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

Gentle cousin,

Let us go thank him and encourage him.

My father’s rough and envious disposition

Sticks me at heart.—Sir, you have well deserved.

If you do keep your promises in love

But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,

Your mistress shall be happy.

Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.

Will you go, coz?

Why, cousin! Why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy,

not a word?

No, thy words are too precious to be cast away

upon curs. Throw some of them at me. Come, lame

me with reasons.

But is all this for your father?

They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in

holiday foolery. If we walk not in the trodden paths,

our very petticoats will catch them.

Hem them away.

Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

O, a good wish upon you. You will try in time, in

despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of

service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible on

such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking

with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?

Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his

son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him,

for my father hated his father dearly. Yet I hate not

Orlando.

Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?

With his eyes full of anger.

Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

I did not then entreat to have her stay.

It was your pleasure and your own remorse.

I was too young that time to value her,

But now I know her. If she be a traitor,

Why, so am I. We still have slept together,

Rose at an instant, learned, played, eat together,

And, wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans

Still we went coupled and inseparable.

Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.

I cannot live out of her company.

O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?

Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.

I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

Thou hast not, cousin.

Prithee, be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke

Hath banished me, his daughter?

No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love

Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.

Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?

No, let my father seek another heir.

Therefore devise with me how we may fly,

Whither to go, and what to bear with us,

And do not seek to take your change upon you,

To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out.

For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,

Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.

To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.

I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,

And with a kind of umber smirch my face.

The like do you. So shall we pass along

And never stir assailants.

What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

Something that hath a reference to my state:

No longer Celia, but Aliena.

He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.

Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away

And get our jewels and our wealth together,

Devise the fittest time and safest way

To hide us from pursuit that will be made

After my flight. Now go we in content

To liberty, and not to banishment.

I pray you bear with me. I cannot go no further.

I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he

for gold will give us any food. I faint almost to death.

And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,

And willingly could waste my time in it.

Why should this a desert be?

For it is unpeopled? No.

Tongues I’ll hang on every tree

That shall civil sayings show.

Some how brief the life of man

Runs his erring pilgrimage,

That the stretching of a span

Buckles in his sum of age;

Some of violated vows

’Twixt the souls of friend and friend.

But upon the fairest boughs,

Or at every sentence’ end,

Will I “Rosalinda” write,

Teaching all that read to know

The quintessence of every sprite

Heaven would in little show.

Therefore heaven nature charged

That one body should be filled

With all graces wide-enlarged.

Nature presently distilled

Helen’s cheek, but not her heart,

Cleopatra’s majesty,

Atalanta’s better part,

Sad Lucretia’s modesty.

Thus Rosalind of many parts

By heavenly synod was devised

Of many faces, eyes, and hearts

To have the touches dearest prized.

Heaven would that she these gifts should have

And I to live and die her slave.

How now?—Back, friends. Shepherd,

go off a little.—Go with him, sirrah.

Didst thou hear these verses?

That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.

But didst thou hear without wondering how thy

name should be hanged and carved upon these

trees?

Trow you who hath done this?

And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.

Change you color?

O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to

meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes

and so encounter.

Is it possible?

O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful

wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that

out of all whooping!

So you may put a man in your belly.

Nay, he hath but a little beard.

It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s

heels and your heart both in an instant.

I’ faith, coz, ’tis he.

Orlando.

You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first.

’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size.

To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to

answer in a catechism.

It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the

propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my

finding him, and relish it with good observance. I

found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.

Give me audience, good madam.

There lay he, stretched along like a wounded

knight.

Cry “holla” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets

unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.

I would sing my song without a burden. Thou

bring’st me out of tune.

You bring me out.

Soft, comes he not here?

Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider

that tears do not become a man.

As good cause as one would desire. Therefore

weep.

Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his

kisses are Judas’s own children.

An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the

only color.

He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A

nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously.

The very ice of chastity is in them.

Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-stealer,

but for his verity in love, I do think him as

concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.

Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.

“Was” is not “is.” Besides, the oath of a lover is

no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are

both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends

here in the forest on the Duke your father.

O, that’s a brave man. He writes brave verses,

speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks

them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of

his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on

one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all’s

brave that youth mounts and folly guides.

Who comes here?

Well, and what of him?

It pleases him to call you so, but he

hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.

I cannot say the words.

Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to

wife this Rosalind?

You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.

We must have your doublet and hose plucked

over your head and show the world what the bird

hath done to her own nest.

Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour

affection in, it runs out.

And I’ll sleep.

I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain

he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth

to sleep.

Look who comes here.

Alas, poor shepherd.

West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom;

The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream

Left on your right hand brings you to the place.

But at this hour the house doth keep itself.

There’s none within.

It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.

I pray you tell it.

O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,

And he did render him the most unnatural

That lived amongst men.

Are you his brother?

Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?

There is more in it.—Cousin Ganymede.

We’ll lead you thither.—I pray you,

will you take him by the arm?

Come, you look paler and paler. Pray

you draw homewards.—Good sir, go with us.
