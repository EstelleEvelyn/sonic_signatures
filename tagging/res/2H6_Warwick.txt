


Long live Queen Margaret England's happiness

For grief that they are past recovery

For were there hope to conquer them again

My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears

Anjou and Maine Myself did win them both

Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer

And are the cities that I got with wounds

Delivered up again with peaceful words

Mort Dieu

So God help Warwick as he loves the land

And common profit of his country

Unto the main O father Maine is lost

That Maine which by main force Warwick did win

And would have kept so long as breath did last

Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine

Which I will win from France or else be slain

Whether your Grace be worthy yea or no

Dispute not that York is the worthier

The Cardinal's not my better in the field

Warwick may live to be the best of all

That can I witness and a fouler fact

Did never traitor in the land commit

Image of pride why should I hold my peace

Sweet York begin and if thy claim be good

The Nevilles are thy subjects to command

Father the Duke hath told the truth

Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown

What plain proceedings is more plain than this

Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt

The fourth son York claims it from the third

Till Lionel's issue fails his should not reign

It fails not yet but flourishes in thee

And in thy sons fair slips of such a stock

Then father Salisbury kneel we together

And in this private plot be we the first

That shall salute our rightful sovereign

With honor of his birthright to the crown

Long live our sovereign Richard England's king

My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick

Shall one day make the Duke of York a king

It is reported mighty sovereign

That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murdered

By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means

The Commons like an angry hive of bees

That want their leader scatter up and down

And care not who they sting in his revenge

Myself have calmed their spleenful mutiny

Until they hear the order of his death

That shall I do my liegeStay Salisbury

With the rude multitude till I return

Come hither gracious sovereign View this body

As surely as my soul intends to live

With that dread King that took our state upon Him

To free us from His Father's wrathful curse

I do believe that violent hands were laid

Upon the life of this thrice-famd duke

See how the blood is settled in his face

Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost

Of ashy semblance meager pale and bloodless

Being all descended to the laboring heart

Who in the conflict that it holds with death

Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy

Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth

To blush and beautify the cheek again

But see his face is black and full of blood

His eyeballs further out than when he lived

Staring full ghastly like a strangled man

His hair upreared his nostrils stretched with struggling

His hands abroad displayed as one that grasped

And tugged for life and was by strength subdued

Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking

His well-proportioned beard made rough and rugged

Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged

It cannot be but he was murdered here

The least of all these signs were probable

But both of you were vowed Duke Humphrey's foes

And you forsooth had the good duke to keep

'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend

And 'tis well seen he found an enemy

Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh

And sees fast by a butcher with an ax

But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter

Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest

But may imagine how the bird was dead

Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak

Even so suspicious is this tragedy

What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him

Madam be stillwith reverence may I say

For every word you speak in his behalf

Is slander to your royal dignity

But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee

And I should rob the deathsman of his fee

Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames

And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild

I would false murd'rous coward on thy knee

Make thee beg pardon for thy passd speech

And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st

That thou thyself wast born in bastardy

And after all this fearful homage done

Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell

Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men

Away even now or I will drag thee hence

Unworthy though thou art I'll cope with thee

And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost

Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee

See how the pangs of death do make him grin

So bad a death argues a monstrous life

You were best to go to bed and dream again

To keep thee from the tempest of the field

Now by my father's badge old Neville's crest

The rampant bear chained to the ragged staff

This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet

As on a mountaintop the cedar shows

That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm

Even to affright thee with the view thereof

Clifford of Cumberland 'tis Warwick calls

An if thou dost not hide thee from the bear

Now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum

And dead men's cries do fill the empty air

Clifford I say come forth and fight with me

Proud northern lord Clifford of Cumberland

Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms

How now my noble lord What all afoot

Of one or both of us the time is come

Then nobly York 'Tis for a crown thou fight'st

As I intend Clifford to thrive today

It grieves my soul to leave thee unassailed

After them Nay before them if we can

Now by my hand lords 'twas a glorious day

Saint Albans battle won by famous York

Shall be eternized in all age to come

Sound drum and trumpets and to London all

And more such days as these to us befall
