


A friend.

Stephano is my name, and I bring word

My mistress will before the break of day

Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about

By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays

For happy wedlock hours.

None but a holy hermit and her maid.

I pray you, is my master yet returned?
