


Old John of Gaunt time-honored Lancaster

Hast thou according to thy oath and band

Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son

Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal

Which then our leisure would not let us hear

Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray

Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him

If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice

Or worthily as a good subject should

On some known ground of treachery in him

Then call them to our presence  Face to face

And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear

The accuser and the accusd freely speak

High stomached are they both and full of ire

In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire

We thank you both Yet one but flatters us

As well appeareth by the cause you come

Namely to appeal each other of high treason

Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object

Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray

What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge

It must be great that can inherit us

So much as of a thought of ill in him

How high a pitch his resolution soars

Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this

Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears

Were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir

As he is but my father's brother's son

Now by my scepter's awe I make a vow

Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood

Should nothing privilege him nor partialize

The unstooping firmness of my upright soul

He is our subject Mowbray so art thou

Free speech and fearless I to thee allow

Wrath-kindled gentlemen be ruled by me

Let's purge this choler without letting blood

This we prescribe though no physician

Deep malice makes too deep incision

Forget forgive conclude and be agreed

Our doctors say this is no month to bleed

Good uncle let this end where it begun

We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son

And Norfolk throw down his

Norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot

Rage must be withstood

Give me his gage Lions make leopards tame

Cousin throw up your gage Do you begin

We were not born to sue but to command

Which since we cannot do to make you friends

Be ready as your lives shall answer it

At Coventry upon Saint Lambert's day

There shall your swords and lances arbitrate

The swelling difference of your settled hate

Since we cannot atone you we shall see

Justice design the victor's chivalry

Lord Marshal command our officers-at-arms

Be ready to direct these home alarms

Marshal demand of yonder champion

The cause of his arrival here in arms

Ask him his name and orderly proceed

To swear him in the justice of his cause

Marshal ask yonder knight in arms

Both who he is and why he cometh hither

Thus plated in habiliments of war

And formally according to our law

Depose him in the justice of his cause

We will descend and fold him in our arms

Cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right

So be thy fortune in this royal fight

Farewell my bloodwhich if today thou shed

Lament we may but not revenge thee dead

Farewell my lord Securely I espy

Virtue with valor couchd in thine eye

Order the trial marshal and begin

Let them lay by their helmets and their spears

And both return back to their chairs again

Withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound

While we return these dukes what we decree

Draw near

And list what with our council we have done

For that our kingdom's earth should not be soiled

With that dear blood which it hath fosterd

And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect

Of civil wounds plowed up with neighbor's sword

And for we think the eagle-wingd pride

Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts

With rival-hating envy set on you

To wake our peace which in our country's cradle

Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep

Which so roused up with boist'rous untuned drums

With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray

And grating shock of wrathful iron arms

Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace

And make us wade even in our kindred's blood

Therefore we banish you our territories

You cousin Hereford upon pain of life

Till twice five summers have enriched our fields

Shall not regreet our fair dominions

But tread the stranger paths of banishment

Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom

Which I with some unwillingness pronounce

The sly slow hours shall not determinate

The dateless limit of thy dear exile

The hopeless word of never to return

Breathe I against thee upon pain of life

It boots thee not to be compassionate

After our sentence plaining comes too late

Return again and take an oath with thee

Lay on our royal sword your banished hands

Swear by the duty that you owe to God

Our part therein we banish with yourselves

To keep the oath that we administer

You never shall so help you truth and God

Embrace each other's love in banishment

Nor never look upon each other's face

Nor never write regreet nor reconcile

This louring tempest of your homebred hate

Nor never by advisd purpose meet

To plot contrive or complot any ill

'Gainst us our state our subjects or our land

Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes

I see thy grievd heart Thy sad aspect

Hath from the number of his banished years

Plucked four away Six frozen winters spent

Return with welcome home from banishment

Why uncle thou hast many years to live

Thy son is banished upon good advice

Whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave

Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour

Cousin farewellAnd uncle bid him so

Six years we banish him and he shall go

We did observeCousin Aumerle

How far brought you high Hereford on his way

And say what store of parting tears were shed

What said our cousin when you parted with him

He is our cousin cousin but 'tis doubt

When time shall call him home from banishment

Whether our kinsman come to see his friends

Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green

Observed his courtship to the common people

How he did seem to dive into their hearts

With humble and familiar courtesy

What reverence he did throw away on slaves

Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles

And patient underbearing of his fortune

As 'twere to banish their affects with him

Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench

A brace of draymen bid God speed him well

And had the tribute of his supple knee

With Thanks my countrymen my loving friends

As were our England in reversion his

And he our subjects' next degree in hope

We will ourself in person to this war

And for our coffers with too great a court

And liberal largess are grown somewhat light

We are enforced to farm our royal realm

The revenue whereof shall furnish us

For our affairs in hand If that come short

Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters

Whereto when they shall know what men are rich

They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold

And send them after to supply our wants

For we will make for Ireland presently

Bushy what news

Where lies he

Now put it God in the physician's mind

To help him to his grave immediately

The lining of his coffers shall make coats

To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars

Come gentlemen let's all go visit him

Pray God we may make haste and come too late

What comfort man How is 't with agd Gaunt

Can sick men play so nicely with their names

Should dying men flatter with those that live

Thou now a-dying sayest thou flatterest me

I am in health I breathe and see thee ill

A lunatic lean-witted fool

Presuming on an ague's privilege

Darest with thy frozen admonition

Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood

With fury from his native residence

Now by my seat's right royal majesty

Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son

This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head

Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders

And let them die that age and sullens have

For both hast thou and both become the grave

Right you say true as Hereford's love so his

As theirs so mine and all be as it is

What says he

The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he

His time is spent our pilgrimage must be

So much for that Now for our Irish wars

We must supplant those rough rugheaded kern

Which live like venom where no venom else

But only they have privilege to live

And for these great affairs do ask some charge

Towards our assistance we do seize to us

The plate coin revenues and movables

Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessed

Why uncle what's the matter

Think what you will we seize into our hands

His plate his goods his money and his lands

Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight

Bid him repair to us to Ely House

To see this business Tomorrow next

We will for Ireland and 'tis time I trow

And we create in absence of ourself

Our uncle York Lord Governor of England

For he is just and always loved us well

Come on our queen Tomorrow must we part

Be merry for our time of stay is short

Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand

Needs must I like it well I weep for joy

To stand upon my kingdom once again

Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand

Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs

As a long-parted mother with her child

Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting

So weeping smiling greet I thee my earth

And do thee favors with my royal hands

Feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth

Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense

But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom

And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way

Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet

Which with usurping steps do trample thee

Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies

And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower

Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder

Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch

Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies

Mock not my senseless conjuration lords

This earth shall have a feeling and these stones

Prove armd soldiers ere her native king

Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms

Discomfortable cousin know'st thou not

That when the searching eye of heaven is hid

Behind the globe that lights the lower world

Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen

In murders and in outrage boldly here

But when from under this terrestrial ball

He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines

And darts his light through every guilty hole

Then murders treasons and detested sins

The cloak of night being plucked from off their backs

Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves

So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke

Who all this while hath reveled in the night

Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes

Shall see us rising in our throne the east

His treasons will sit blushing in his face

Not able to endure the sight of day

But self-affrighted tremble at his sin

Not all the water in the rough rude sea

Can wash the balm off from an anointed king

The breath of worldly men cannot depose

The deputy elected by the Lord

For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed

To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown

God for His Richard hath in heavenly pay

A glorious angel Then if angels fight

Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right

Welcome my lord How far off lies your power

But now the blood of twenty thousand men

Did triumph in my face and they are fled

And till so much blood thither come again

Have I not reason to look pale and dead

All souls that will be safe fly from my side

For time hath set a blot upon my pride

I had forgot myself Am I not king

Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest

Is not the King's name twenty thousand names

Arm arm my name A puny subject strikes

At thy great glory Look not to the ground

You favorites of a king Are we not high

High be our thoughts I know my Uncle York

Hath power enough to serve our turnBut who comes here

Mine ear is open and my heart prepared

The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold

Say is my kingdom lost Why 'twas my care

And what loss is it to be rid of care

Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we

Greater he shall not be If he serve God

We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so

Revolt our subjects That we cannot mend

They break their faith to God as well as us

Cry woe destruction ruin and decay

The worst is death and death will have his day

Too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill

Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot

What is become of Bushy Where is Green

That they have let the dangerous enemy

Measure our confines with such peaceful steps

If we prevail their heads shall pay for it

I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke

O villains vipers damned without redemption

Dogs easily won to fawn on any man

Snakes in my heart blood warmed that sting my heart

Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas

Would they make peace Terrible hell

Make war upon their spotted souls for this

No matter where Of comfort no man speak

Let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs

Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes

Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth

Let's choose executors and talk of wills

And yet not so for what can we bequeath

Save our deposd bodies to the ground

Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbroke's

And nothing can we call our own but death

And that small model of the barren earth

Which serves as paste and cover to our bones

For God's sake let us sit upon the ground

And tell sad stories of the death of kings

How some have been deposed some slain in war

Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed

Some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed

All murdered For within the hollow crown

That rounds the mortal temples of a king

Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits

Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp

Allowing him a breath a little scene

To monarchize be feared and kill with looks

Infusing him with self and vain conceit

As if this flesh which walls about our life

Were brass impregnable and humored thus

Comes at the last and with a little pin

Bores through his castle wall and farewell king

Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood

With solemn reverence Throw away respect

Tradition form and ceremonious duty

For you have but mistook me all this while

I live with bread like you feel want

Taste grief need friends Subjected thus

How can you say to me I am a king

Thou chid'st me wellProud Bolingbroke I come

To change blows with thee for our day of doom

This ague fit of fear is overblown

An easy task it is to win our own

Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power

Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour

Thou hast said enough

Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth

Of that sweet way I was in to despair

What say you now What comfort have we now

By heaven I'll hate him everlastingly

That bids me be of comfort anymore

Go to Flint Castle There I'll pine away

A king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey

That power I have discharge and let them go

To ear the land that hath some hope to grow

For I have none Let no man speak again

To alter this for counsel is but vain

He does me double wrong

That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue

Discharge my followers Let them hence away

From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day

We are amazed and thus long have we stood

To watch the fearful bending of thy knee

Because we thought ourself thy lawful king

An if we be how dare thy joints forget

To pay their awful duty to our presence

If we be not show us the hand of God

That hath dismissed us from our stewardship

For well we know no hand of blood and bone

Can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter

Unless he do profane steal or usurp

And though you think that all as you have done

Have torn their souls by turning them from us

And we are barren and bereft of friends

Yet know my master God omnipotent

Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf

Armies of pestilence and they shall strike

Your children yet unborn and unbegot

That lift your vassal hands against my head

And threat the glory of my precious crown

Tell Bolingbrokefor yon methinks he stands

That every stride he makes upon my land

Is dangerous treason He is come to open

The purple testament of bleeding war

But ere the crown he looks for live in peace

Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons

Shall ill become the flower of England's face

Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace

To scarlet indignation and bedew

Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood

Northumberland say thus the King returns

His noble cousin is right welcome hither

And all the number of his fair demands

Shall be accomplished without contradiction

With all the gracious utterance thou hast

Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends

We do debase ourselves cousin do we not

To look so poorly and to speak so fair

Shall we call back Northumberland and send

Defiance to the traitor and so die

O God O God that e'er this tongue of mine

That laid the sentence of dread banishment

On yon proud man should take it off again

With words of sooth O that I were as great

As is my grief or lesser than my name

Or that I could forget what I have been

Or not remember what I must be now

Swell'st thou proud heart I'll give thee scope to beat

Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me

What must the King do now Must he submit

The King shall do it Must he be deposed

The King shall be contented Must he lose

The name of king I' God's name let it go

I'll give my jewels for a set of beads

My gorgeous palace for a hermitage

My gay apparel for an almsman's gown

My figured goblets for a dish of wood

My scepter for a palmer's walking-staff

My subjects for a pair of carvd saints

And my large kingdom for a little grave

A little little grave an obscure grave

Or I'll be buried in the King's highway

Some way of common trade where subjects' feet

May hourly trample on their sovereign's head

For on my heart they tread now whilst I live

And buried once why not upon my head

Aumerle thou weep'st my tender-hearted cousin

We'll make foul weather with despisd tears

Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn

And make a dearth in this revolting land

Or shall we play the wantons with our woes

And make some pretty match with shedding tears

As thus to drop them still upon one place

Till they have fretted us a pair of graves

Within the earth and therein laidthere lies

Two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes

Would not this ill do well Well well I see

I talk but idly and you laugh at me

Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland

What says King Bolingbroke Will his Majesty

Give Richard leave to live till Richard die

You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay

Down down I come like glist'ring Phaton

Wanting the manage of unruly jades

In the base courtbase court where kings grow base

To come at traitors' calls and do them grace

In the base court come downdown court down king

For nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing

Fair cousin you debase your princely knee

To make the base earth proud with kissing it

Me rather had my heart might feel your love

Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy

Up cousin up Your heart is up I know

Thus high at least although your knee be low

Your own is yours and I am yours and all

Well you deserve They well deserve to have

That know the strong'st and surest way to get

Uncle give me your hands Nay dry your eyes

Tears show their love but want their remedies

Cousin I am too young to be your father

Though you are old enough to be my heir

What you will have I'll give and willing too

For do we must what force will have us do

Set on towards London cousin is it so

Then I must not say no

Alack why am I sent for to a king

Before I have shook off the regal thoughts

Wherewith I reigned I hardly yet have learned

To insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee

Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me

To this submission Yet I well remember

The favors of these men Were they not mine

Did they not sometime cry All hail to me

So Judas did to Christ but He in twelve

Found truth in all but one I in twelve thousand none

God save the King Will no man say amen

Am I both priest and clerk Well then amen

God save the King although I be not he

And yet amen if heaven do think him me

To do what service am I sent for hither

Give me the crownHere cousin seize the crown

Here cousin

On this side my hand on that side thine

Now is this golden crown like a deep well

That owes two buckets filling one another

The emptier ever dancing in the air

The other down unseen and full of water

That bucket down and full of tears am I

Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high

My crown I am but still my griefs are mine

You may my glories and my state depose

But not my griefs still am I king of those

Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down

My care is loss of care by old care done

Your care is gain of care by new care won

The cares I give I have though given away

They 'tend the crown yet still with me they stay

Ay no no ay for I must nothing be

Therefore no no for I resign to thee

Now mark me how I will undo myself

I give this heavy weight from off my head

And this unwieldy scepter from my hand

The pride of kingly sway from out my heart

With mine own tears I wash away my balm

With mine own hands I give away my crown

With mine own tongue deny my sacred state

With mine own breath release all duteous oaths

All pomp and majesty I do forswear

My manors rents revenues I forgo

My acts decrees and statutes I deny

God pardon all oaths that are broke to me

God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee

Make me that nothing have with nothing grieved

And thou with all pleased that hast all achieved

Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit

And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit

God save King Henry unkinged Richard says

And send him many years of sunshine days

What more remains

Must I do so And must I ravel out

My weaved-up follies Gentle Northumberland

If thy offenses were upon record

Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop

To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst

There shouldst thou find one heinous article

Containing the deposing of a king

And cracking the strong warrant of an oath

Marked with a blot damned in the book of heaven

Nay all of you that stand and look upon me

Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself

Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands

Showing an outward pity yet you Pilates

Have here delivered me to my sour cross

And water cannot wash away your sin

Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see

And yet salt water blinds them not so much

But they can see a sort of traitors here

Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself

I find myself a traitor with the rest

For I have given here my soul's consent

T' undeck the pompous body of a king

Made glory base and sovereignty a slave

Proud majesty a subject state a peasant

No lord of thine thou haught insulting man

Nor no man's lord I have no name no title

No not that name was given me at the font

But 'tis usurped Alack the heavy day

That I have worn so many winters out

And know not now what name to call myself

O that I were a mockery king of snow

Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke

To melt myself away in water drops

Good king great king and yet not greatly good

An if my word be sterling yet in England

Let it command a mirror hither straight

That it may show me what a face I have

Since it is bankrupt of his majesty

Fiend thou torments me ere I come to hell

They shall be satisfied I'll read enough

When I do see the very book indeed

Where all my sins are writ and that's myself

Give me that glass and therein will I read

No deeper wrinkles yet Hath sorrow struck

So many blows upon this face of mine

And made no deeper wounds O flatt'ring glass

Like to my followers in prosperity

Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face

That every day under his household roof

Did keep ten thousand men Was this the face

That like the sun did make beholders wink

Is this the face which faced so many follies

That was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke

A brittle glory shineth in this face

As brittle as the glory is the face

For there it is cracked in an hundred shivers

Mark silent king the moral of this sport

How soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face

Say that again

The shadow of my sorrow Ha let's see

'Tis very true My grief lies all within

And these external manners of laments

Are merely shadows to the unseen grief

That swells with silence in the tortured soul

There lies the substance And I thank thee king

For thy great bounty that not only giv'st

Me cause to wail but teachest me the way

How to lament the cause I'll beg one boon

And then be gone and trouble you no more

Shall I obtain it

Fair cousin I am greater than a king

For when I was a king my flatterers

Were then but subjects Being now a subject

I have a king here to my flatterer

Being so great I have no need to beg

And shall I have

Then give me leave to go

Whither you will so I were from your sights

O good Convey Conveyers are you all

That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall

Join not with grief fair woman do not so

To make my end too sudden Learn good soul

To think our former state a happy dream

From which awaked the truth of what we are

Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet

To grim necessity and he and I

Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France

And cloister thee in some religious house

Our holy lives must win a new world's crown

Which our profane hours here have thrown down

A king of beasts indeed If aught but beasts

I had been still a happy king of men

Good sometime queen prepare thee hence for France

Think I am dead and that even here thou takest

As from my deathbed thy last living leave

In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire

With good old folks and let them tell thee tales

Of woeful ages long ago betid

And ere thou bid good night to quite their griefs

Tell thou the lamentable tale of me

And send the hearers weeping to their beds

Forwhy the senseless brands will sympathize

The heavy accent of thy moving tongue

And in compassion weep the fire out

And some will mourn in ashes some coal-black

For the deposing of a rightful king

Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal

The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne

The time shall not be many hours of age

More than it is ere foul sin gathering head

Shall break into corruption Thou shalt think

Though he divide the realm and give thee half

It is too little helping him to all

He shall think that thou which knowest the way

To plant unrightful kings wilt know again

Being ne'er so little urged another way

To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne

The love of wicked men converts to fear

That fear to hate and hate turns one or both

To worthy danger and deservd death

Doubly divorced Bad men you violate

A twofold marriagetwixt my crown and me

And then betwixt me and my married wife

Let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me

And yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made

Part us Northumberland I towards the north

Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime

My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp

She came adornd hither like sweet May

Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day

Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart

So two together weeping make one woe

Weep thou for me in France I for thee here

Better far off than near be ne'er the near

Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans

Twice for one step I'll groan the way being short

And piece the way out with a heavy heart

Come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief

Since wedding it there is such length in grief

One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part

Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart

We make woe wanton with this fond delay

Once more adieu The rest let sorrow say

I have been studying how I may compare

This prison where I live unto the world

And for because the world is populous

And here is not a creature but myself

I cannot do it Yet I'll hammer it out

My brain I'll prove the female to my soul

My soul the father and these two beget

A generation of still-breeding thoughts

And these same thoughts people this little world

In humors like the people of this world

For no thought is contented The better sort

As thoughts of things divine are intermixed

With scruples and do set the word itself

Against the word as thus Come little ones

And then again

It is as hard to come as for a camel

To thread the postern of a small needle's eye

Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot

Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails

May tear a passage through the flinty ribs

Of this hard world my ragged prison walls

And for they cannot die in their own pride

Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves

That they are not the first of fortune's slaves

Nor shall not be the lastlike silly beggars

Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame

That many have and others must sit there

And in this thought they find a kind of ease

Bearing their own misfortunes on the back

Of such as have before endured the like

Thus play I in one person many people

And none contented Sometimes am I king

Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar

And so I am then crushing penury

Persuades me I was better when a king

Then am I kinged again and by and by

Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke

And straight am nothing But whate'er I be

Nor I nor any man that but man is

With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased

With being nothing Music do I hear

Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is

When time is broke and no proportion kept

So is it in the music of men's lives

And here have I the daintiness of ear

To check time broke in a disordered string

But for the concord of my state and time

Had not an ear to hear my true time broke

I wasted time and now doth time waste me

For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock

My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar

Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch

Whereto my finger like a dial's point

Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears

Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is

Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart

Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans

Show minutes times and hours But my time

Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy

While I stand fooling here his jack of the clock

This music mads me Let it sound no more

For though it have holp madmen to their wits

In me it seems it will make wise men mad

Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me

For 'tis a sign of love and love to Richard

Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world

Thanks noble peer

The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear

What art thou and how comest thou hither

Where no man never comes but that sad dog

That brings me food to make misfortune live

Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend

How went he under him

So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back

That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand

This hand hath made him proud with clapping him

Would he not stumble Would he not fall down

Since pride must have a fall and break the neck

Of that proud man that did usurp his back

Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee

Since thou created to be awed by man

Wast born to bear I was not made a horse

And yet I bear a burden like an ass

Spurred galled and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke

If thou love me 'tis time thou wert away

Taste of it first as thou art wont to do

The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee

Patience is stale and I am weary of it

How now what means death in this rude assault

Villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument

Go thou and fill another room in hell

That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire

That staggers thus my person Exton thy fierce hand

Hath with the King's blood stained the King's own land

Mount mount my soul Thy seat is up on high

Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
