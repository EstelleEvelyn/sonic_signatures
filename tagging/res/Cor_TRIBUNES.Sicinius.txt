When we were chosen tribunes for the people—

Nay, but his taunts.

Bemock the modest moon.

Such a nature,

Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow

Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder

His insolence can brook to be commanded

Under Cominius.

Besides, if things go well,

Opinion that so sticks on Martius shall

Of his demerits rob Cominius.

Let’s hence and hear

How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,

More than his singularity, he goes

Upon this present action.

Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

The lamb.

Well, sir.

Especially in pride.

Why, how are we censured?

Well, well, sir, well?

What then, sir?

Menenius, you are known well enough, too.

On the sudden

I warrant him consul.

He cannot temp’rately transport his honors

From where he should begin and end, but will

Lose those he hath won.

Doubt not

The commoners, for whom we stand, but they

Upon their ancient malice will forget

With the least cause these his new honors—which

That he will give them make I as little question

As he is proud to do ’t.

’Tis right.

I wish no better

Than have him hold that purpose and to put it

In execution.

It shall be to him then as our good wills,

A sure destruction.

This, as you say, suggested

At some time when his soaring insolence

Shall touch the people—which time shall not want

If he be put upon ’t, and that’s as easy

As to set dogs on sheep—will be his fire

To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze

Shall darken him forever.

Have with you.

We are convented

Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts

Inclinable to honor and advance

The theme of our assembly.

Sir, the people

Must have their voices; neither will they bate

One jot of ceremony.

May they perceive ’s intent! He will require them

As if he did contemn what he requested

Should be in them to give.

The custom of request you have discharged.

The people do admit you, and are summoned

To meet anon upon your approbation.

There, Coriolanus.

You may, sir.

Fare you well.

He has it now; and by his looks, methinks,

’Tis warm at ’s heart.

How now, my masters, have you chose this man?

Why, so he did, I am sure.

Why either were you ignorant to see ’t

Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness

To yield your voices?

Thus to have said,

As you were fore-advised, had touched his spirit

And tried his inclination; from him plucked

Either his gracious promise, which you might,

As cause had called you up, have held him to;

Or else it would have galled his surly nature,

Which easily endures not article

Tying him to aught. So putting him to rage,

You should have ta’en th’ advantage of his choler

And passed him unelected.

Have you ere now denied the asker? And now

Again, of him that did not ask but mock,

Bestow your sued-for tongues?

Let them assemble

And, on a safer judgment, all revoke

Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride

And his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not

With what contempt he wore the humble weed,

How in his suit he scorned you; but your loves,

Thinking upon his services, took from you

Th’ apprehension of his present portance,

Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion

After the inveterate hate he bears you.

Say you chose him

More after our commandment than as guided

By your own true affections, and that your minds,

Preoccupied with what you rather must do

Than what you should, made you against the grain

To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.

One thus descended,

That hath besides well in his person wrought

To be set high in place, we did commend

To your remembrances; but you have found,

Scaling his present bearing with his past,

That he’s your fixèd enemy, and revoke

Your sudden approbation.

To th’ Capitol, come.

We will be there before the stream o’ th’ people,

And this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own,

Which we have goaded onward.

Pass no further.

Stop,

Or all will fall in broil.

You show too much of that

For which the people stir. If you will pass

To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,

Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,

Or never be so noble as a consul,

Nor yoke with him for tribune.

’Twere well

We let the people know ’t.

It is a mind

That shall remain a poison where it is,

Not poison any further.

’Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer

As traitors do.

This a consul? No.

Go, call the people; in whose name myself

Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,

A foe to th’ public weal. Obey, I charge thee,

And follow to thine answer.

Help, you citizens!

Here’s he that would take from you all your power.

Peace, peace, peace! Stay, hold, peace!

Hear me, people! Peace!

You are at point to lose your liberties.

Martius would have all from you, Martius,

Whom late you have named for consul.

What is the city but the people?

This deserves death.

Therefore lay hold of him,

Bear him to th’ rock Tarpeian, and from thence

Into destruction cast him.

Where is this viper

That would depopulate the city and

Be every man himself?

He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock

With rigorous hands. He hath resisted law,

And therefore law shall scorn him further trial

Than the severity of the public power

Which he so sets at naught.

Peace!

Sir, how comes ’t that you

Have holp to make this rescue?

Consul? What consul?

Speak briefly then,

For we are peremptory to dispatch

This viperous traitor. To eject him hence

Were but one danger, and to keep him here

Our certain death. Therefore it is decreed

He dies tonight.

He’s a disease that must be cut away.

This is clean cam.

The service of the foot,

Being once gangrened, is not then respected

For what before it was.

What do you talk?

Have we not had a taste of his obedience?

Our aediles smote! Ourselves resisted! Come.

Noble Menenius,

Be you then as the people’s officer.—

Masters, lay down your weapons.

Meet on the marketplace. We’ll attend you there,

Where if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceed

In our first way.

Have you a catalogue

Of all the voices that we have procured,

Set down by th’ poll?

Have you collected them by tribes?

Assemble presently the people hither;

And when they hear me say “It shall be so

I’ th’ right and strength o’ th’ commons,” be it either

For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them

If I say “Fine,” cry “Fine,” if “Death,” cry “Death,”

Insisting on the old prerogative

And power i’ th’ truth o’ th’ cause.

Make them be strong and ready for this hint

When we shall hap to give ’t them.

Well, here he comes.

Draw near, you people.

Well, say.—Peace, ho!

I do demand

If you submit you to the people’s voices,

Allow their officers, and are content

To suffer lawful censure for such faults

As shall be proved upon you.

Answer to us.

We charge you that you have contrived to take

From Rome all seasoned office and to wind

Yourself into a power tyrannical,

For which you are a traitor to the people.

Mark you this, people?

Peace!

We need not put new matter to his charge.

What you have seen him do and heard him speak,

Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,

Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying

Those whose great power must try him—even this,

So criminal and in such capital kind,

Deserves th’ extremest death.

For that he has,

As much as in him lies, from time to time

Envied against the people, seeking means

To pluck away their power, as now at last

Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence

Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers

That doth distribute it, in the name o’ th’ people

And in the power of us the Tribunes, we,

Even from this instant, banish him our city

In peril of precipitation

From off the rock Tarpeian, never more

To enter our Rome gates. I’ th’ people’s name,

I say it shall be so.

He’s sentenced. No more hearing.

We know your drift. Speak what?

Go see him out at gates, and follow him,

As he hath followed you, with all despite.

Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard

Attend us through the city.

Bid them all home. He’s gone, and we’ll no further.

The nobility are vexed, whom we see have sided

In his behalf.

Bid them home.

Say their great enemy is gone, and they

Stand in their ancient strength.

Let’s not meet her.

They say she’s mad.

Are you mankind?

O blessèd heavens!

What then?

I would he had continued to his country

As he began, and not unknit himself

The noble knot he made.

Why stay we to be baited

With one that wants her wits?

We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.

His remedies are tame—the present peace,

And quietness of the people, which before

Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends

Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,

Though they themselves did suffer by ’t, behold

Dissentious numbers pest’ring streets than see

Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going

About their functions friendly.

’Tis he, ’tis he. O, he is grown most kind

Of late.—Hail, sir.

Your Coriolanus is not much missed

But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,

And so would do were he more angry at it.

Where is he, hear you?

Good e’en, our neighbors.

Live, and thrive!

Farewell, farewell.

This is a happier and more comely time

Than when these fellows ran about the streets

Crying confusion.

And affecting one sole throne, without assistance.

We should by this, to all our lamentation,

If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

Come, what talk you of Martius?

Tell not me.

I know this cannot be.

’Tis this slave—

Go whip him ’fore the people’s eyes—his raising,

Nothing but his report.

What more fearful?

This is most likely!

The very trick on ’t.

Say not we brought it.

Go, masters, get you home. Be not dismayed.

These are a side that would be glad to have

This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,

And show no sign of fear.

Nor I.

Pray, let’s go.

Nay, pray, be patient. If you refuse your aid

In this so-never-needed help, yet do not

Upbraid ’s with our distress. But sure, if you

Would be your country’s pleader, your good tongue,

More than the instant army we can make,

Might stop our countryman.

Pray you, go to him.

Yet your good will

Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure

As you intended well.

Not?

Why, what of that?

Is ’t possible that so short a time can alter the

condition of a man?

He loved his mother dearly.

Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.

The gods be good unto us.

What’s the news?

Friend,

Art thou certain this is true? Is ’t most certain?

First, the gods bless

you for your tidings; next, accept my thankfulness.

They are near the city?

We’ll meet them, and help the joy.
