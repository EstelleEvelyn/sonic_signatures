


You shall not now be stol'n you have locks upon you

So graze as you find pasture

Come sir are you ready for death

Hanging is the word sir If you be ready for

that you are well cooked

A heavy reckoning for you sir But the comfort

is you shall be called to no more payments fear

no more tavern bills which are often the sadness

of parting as the procuring of mirth You come in

faint for want of meat depart reeling with too

much drink sorry that you have paid too much

and sorry that you are paid too much purse and

brain both empty the brain the heavier for being

too light the purse too light being drawn of heaviness

O of this contradiction you shall now be

quit O the charity of a penny cord It sums up

thousands in a trice You have no true debitor and

creditor but it of what's past is and to come the

discharge Your neck sir is pen book and counters

so the acquittance follows

Indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the

toothache But a man that were to sleep your

sleep and a hangman to help him to bed I think

he would change places with his officer for look

you sir you know not which way you shall go

Your Death has eyes in 's head then I have not

seen him so pictured You must either be directed

by some that take upon them to know or to take

upon yourself that which I am sure you do not

know or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril

And how you shall speed in your journey's end I

think you'll never return to tell one

What an infinite mock is this that a man

should have the best use of eyes to see the way of

blindness I am sure hanging's the way of winking

I'll be hanged then

Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget

young gibbets I never saw one so prone Yet on my

conscience there are verier knaves desire to live

for all he be a Roman and there be some of them

too that die against their wills So should I if I

were one I would we were all of one mind and

one mind good O there were desolation of jailers

and gallowses I speak against my present profit

but my wish hath a preferment in 't
