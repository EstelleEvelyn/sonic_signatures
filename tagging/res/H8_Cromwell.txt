
To his own hand, in ’s bedchamber.

Presently

He did unseal them, and the first he viewed,

He did it with a serious mind; a heed

Was in his countenance. You he bade

Attend him here this morning.

I think by this he is.

I have no power to speak, sir.

How does your Grace?

I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.

The heaviest and the worst

Is your displeasure with the King.

The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen

Lord Chancellor in your place.

That Cranmer is returned with welcome,

Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.

Last, that the Lady Anne,

Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,

This day was viewed in open as his queen,

Going to chapel, and the voice is now

Only about her coronation.

O, my lord,

Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo

So good, so noble, and so true a master?

Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,

With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.

The King shall have my service, but my prayers

Forever and forever shall be yours.

Good sir, have patience.

Please your honors,

The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.

Yes.

My Lord of Winchester, you’re a little,

By your good favor, too sharp. Men so noble,

However faulty, yet should find respect

For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty

To load a falling man.

Why, my lord?

Not sound?

Would you were half so honest!

Men’s prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

Do.

Remember your bold life too.

And I.

We are.

My mind gave me,

In seeking tales and informations

Against this man, whose honesty the devil

And his disciples only envy at,

You blew the fire that burns you. Now, have at you!
