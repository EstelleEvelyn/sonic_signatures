


Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I

As far as toucheth my particular

Yet dread Priam

There is no lady of more softer bowels

More spongy to suck in the sense of fear

More ready to cry out Who knows what follows

Than Hector is The wound of peace is surety

Surety secure but modest doubt is called

The beacon of the wise the tent that searches

To th' bottom of the worst Let Helen go

Since the first sword was drawn about this question

Every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes

Hath been as dear as Helen I mean of ours

If we have lost so many tenths of ours

To guard a thing not oursnor worth to us

Had it our name the value of one ten

What merit's in that reason which denies

The yielding of her up

Brother she is not worth what she doth cost

The keeping

But value dwells not in particular will

It holds his estimate and dignity

As well wherein 'tis precious of itself

As in the prizer 'Tis mad idolatry

To make the service greater than the god

And the will dotes that is attributive

To what infectiously itself affects

Without some image of th' affected merit

It is Cassandra

Peace sister peace

Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains

Of divination in our sister work

Some touches of remorse Or is your blood

So madly hot that no discourse of reason

Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause

Can qualify the same

Paris and Troilus you have both said well

And on the cause and question now in hand

Have glozedbut superficially not much

Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought

Unfit to hear moral philosophy

The reasons you allege do more conduce

To the hot passion of distempered blood

Than to make up a free determination

'Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge

Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice

Of any true decision Nature craves

All dues be rendered to their owners Now

What nearer debt in all humanity

Than wife is to the husband If this law

Of nature be corrupted through affection

And that great minds of partial indulgence

To their benumbd wills resist the same

There is a law in each well-ordered nation

To curb those raging appetites that are

Most disobedient and refractory

If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king

As it is known she is these moral laws

Of nature and of nations speak aloud

To have her back returned Thus to persist

In doing wrong extenuates not wrong

But makes it much more heavy Hector's opinion

Is this in way of truth yet ne'ertheless

My sprightly brethren I propend to you

In resolution to keep Helen still

For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence

Upon our joint and several dignities

I am yours

You valiant offspring of great Priamus

I have a roisting challenge sent amongst

The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks

Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits

I was advertised their great general slept

Whilst emulation in the army crept

This I presume will wake him

Why then will I no more

Thou art great lord my father's sister's son

A cousin-german to great Priam's seed

The obligation of our blood forbids

A gory emulation 'twixt us twain

Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so

That thou couldst say This hand is Grecian all

And this is Trojan the sinews of this leg

All Greek and this all Troy my mother's blood

Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister

Bounds in my father's by Jove multipotent

Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member

Wherein my sword had not impressure made

Of our rank feud But the just gods gainsay

That any drop thou borrowd'st from thy mother

My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword

Be drained Let me embrace thee Ajax

By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms

Hector would have them fall upon him thus

Cousin all honor to thee

Not Neoptolemus so mirable

On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyez

Cries This is hecould promise to himself

A thought of added honor torn from Hector

We'll answer it

The issue is embracementAjax farewell

Aeneas call my brother Troilus to me

And signify this loving interview

To the expecters of our Trojan part

Desire them home  Give me thy hand my cousin

I will go eat with thee and see your knights

The worthiest of them tell me name by name

But for Achilles my own searching eyes

Shall find him by his large and portly size

I thank thee most imperious Agamemnon

Who must we answer

O you my lord By Mars his gauntlet thanks

Mock not that I affect th' untraded oath

Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove

She's well but bade me not commend her to you

O pardon I offend

Let me embrace thee good old chronicle

That hast so long walked hand in hand with time

Most reverend Nestor I am glad to clasp thee

I would they could

I know your favor Lord Ulysses well

Ah sir there's many a Greek and Trojan dead

Since first I saw yourself and Diomed

In Ilium on your Greekish embassy

I must not believe you

There they stand yet and modestly I think

The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost

A drop of Grecian blood The end crowns all

And that old common arbitrator Time

Will one day end it

Is this Achilles

Stand fair I pray thee Let me look on thee

Nay I have done already

O like a book of sport thou 'lt read me o'er

But there's more in me than thou understand'st

Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye

It would discredit the blest gods proud man

To answer such a question Stand again

Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly

As to prenominate in nice conjecture

Where thou wilt hit me dead

Wert thou an oracle to tell me so

I'd not believe thee Henceforth guard thee well

For I'll not kill thee there nor there nor there

But by the forge that stithied Mars his helm

I'll kill thee everywhere yea o'er and o'er

You wisest Grecians pardon me this brag

His insolence draws folly from my lips

But I'll endeavor deeds to match these words

Or may I never

I pray you let us see you in the field

We have had pelting wars since you refused

The Grecians' cause

Thy hand upon that match

I trouble you

Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general

Good night sweet lord Menelaus

Give me your hand

And so good night

You train me to offend you Get you in

By all the everlasting gods I'll go

No more I say

Ho Bid my trumpet sound

Begone I say The gods have heard me swear

Hold you still I say

Mine honor keeps the weather of my fate

Life every man holds dear but the dear man

Holds honor far more precious-dear than life

How now young man Meanest thou to fight today

No faith young Troilus doff thy harness youth

I am today i' th' vein of chivalry

Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong

And tempt not yet the brushes of the war

Unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy

I'll stand today for thee and me and Troy

What vice is that Good Troilus chide me for it

O 'tis fair play

How now How now

Fie savage fie

Troilus I would not have you fight today

Aeneas is afield

And I do stand engaged to many Greeks

Even in the faith of valor to appear

This morning to them

I must not break my faith

You know me dutiful therefore dear sir

Let me not shame respect but give me leave

To take that course by your consent and voice

Which you do here forbid me royal Priam

Andromache I am offended with you

Upon the love you bear me get you in

You are amazed my liege at her exclaim

Go in and cheer the town We'll forth and fight

Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night

What art thou Greek Art thou for Hector's match

Art thou of blood and honor

I do believe thee Live

Yea Troilus O well fought my youngest brother

Pause if thou wilt

Fare thee well

I would have been much more a fresher man

Had I expected thee    How now my brother

Stand stand thou Greek Thou art a goodly mark

No Wilt thou not I like thy armor well

I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all

But I'll be master of it Wilt thou not beast abide

Why then fly on I'll hunt thee for thy hide

Most putrefied core so fair without

Thy goodly armor thus hath cost thy life

Now is my day's work done I'll take my breath

Rest sword thou hast thy fill of blood and death

I am unarmed Forgo this vantage Greek
