


Of honorable reckoning are you both

And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long

But now my lord what say you to my suit

Younger than she are happy mothers made

These times of woe afford no times to woo

Madam good night Commend me to your daughter

Monday my lord

My lord I would that Thursday were tomorrow

My father Capulet will have it so

And I am nothing slow to slack his haste

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death

And therefore have I little talk of love

For Venus smiles not in a house of tears

Now sir her father counts it dangerous

That she do give her sorrow so much sway

And in his wisdom hastes our marriage

To stop the inundation of her tears

Which too much minded by herself alone

May be put from her by society

Now do you know the reason of this haste

Happily met my lady and my wife

That may be must be love on Thursday next

Come you to make confession to this father

Do not deny to him that you love me

So will you I am sure that you love me

Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears

Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report

Thy face is mine and thou hast slandered it

God shield I should disturb devotion

Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse you

Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss

Have I thought long to see this morning's face

And doth it give me such a sight as this

Beguiled divorcd wrongd spited slain

Most detestable death by thee beguiled

By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown

O love O life Not life but love in death

Give me thy torch boy Hence and stand aloof

Yet put it out for I would not be seen

Under yond yew trees lay thee all along

Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground

So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread

Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves

But thou shalt hear it Whistle then to me

As signal that thou hearest something approach

Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee Go

Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew

O woe thy canopy is dust and stones

Which with sweet water nightly I will dew

Or wanting that with tears distilled by moans

The obsequies that I for thee will keep

Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep

The boy gives warning something doth approach

What cursd foot wanders this way tonight

To cross my obsequies and true love's rite

What with a torch Muffle me night awhile

This is that banished haughty Montague

That murdered my love's cousin with which grief

It is supposd the fair creature died

And here is come to do some villainous shame

To the dead bodies I will apprehend him

Stop thy unhallowed toil vile Montague

Can vengeance be pursued further than death

Condemnd villain I do apprehend thee

Obey and go with me for thou must die

I do defy thy commination

And apprehend thee for a felon here

O I am slain If thou be merciful

Open the tomb lay me with Juliet
