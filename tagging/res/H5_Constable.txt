
O peace Prince Dauphin

You are too much mistaken in this king

Question your Grace the late ambassadors

With what great state he heard their embassy

How well supplied with noble councillors

How modest in exception and withal

How terrible in constant resolution

And you shall find his vanities forespent

Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus

Covering discretion with a coat of folly

As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots

That shall first spring and be most delicate

An if he be not fought withal my lord

Let us not live in France Let us quit all

And give our vineyards to a barbarous people

Dieu de batailles where have they this mettle

Is not their climate foggy raw and dull

On whom as in despite the sun looks pale

Killing their fruit with frowns Can sodden water

A drench for sur-reined jades their barley broth

Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat

And shall our quick blood spirited with wine

Seem frosty O for honor of our land

Let us not hang like roping icicles

Upon our houses' thatch whiles a more frosty people

Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields

Poor we may call them in their native lords

This becomes the great

Sorry am I his numbers are so few

His soldiers sick and famished in their march

For I am sure when he shall see our army

He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear

And for achievement offer us his ransom

Tut I have the best armor of the world

Would it were day

It is the best horse of Europe

Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and

excellent horse

Nay for methought yesterday your mistress

shrewdly shook your back

Mine was not bridled

You have good judgment in horsemanship

I had as lief have my mistress a jade

I could make as true a boast as that if I had

a sow to my mistress

Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress

or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose

Stars my lord

And yet my sky shall not want

Ev'n as your horse bears your praises

who would trot as well were some of your brags

dismounted

I will not say so for fear I should be faced

out of my way But I would it were morning for I

would fain be about the ears of the English

You must first go yourself to hazard ere you

have them

I think he will eat all he kills

Swear by her foot that she may tread out

the oath

Doing is activity and he will still be doing

Nor will do none tomorrow He will keep

that good name still

I was told that by one that knows him

better than you

Marry he told me so himself and he said

he cared not who knew it

By my faith sir but it is never anybody

saw it but his lackey 'Tis a hooded valor and when

it appears it will bate

I will cap that proverb with There is

flattery in friendship

Well placed there stands your friend for

the devil Have at the very eye of that proverb with

A pox of the devil

You have shot over

Who hath measured the ground

A valiant and most expert gentleman

Would it were day Alas poor Harry of England He

longs not for the dawning as we do

If the English had any apprehension they

would run away

Just just and the men do sympathize with

the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on

leaving their wits with their wives And then give

them great meals of beef and iron and steel they

will eat like wolves and fight like devils

Then shall we find tomorrow they have

only stomachs to eat and none to fight Now is it

time to arm Come shall we about it

Hark how our steeds for present service neigh

To horse you gallant princes straight to horse

Do but behold yond poor and starvd band

And your fair show shall suck away their souls

Leaving them but the shales and husks of men

There is not work enough for all our hands

Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins

To give each naked curtal ax a stain

That our French gallants shall today draw out

And sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them

The vapor of our valor will o'erturn them

'Tis positive against all exceptions lords

That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants

Who in unnecessary action swarm

About our squares of battle were enough

To purge this field of such a hilding foe

Though we upon this mountain's basis by

Took stand for idle speculation

But that our honors must not What's to say

A very little little let us do

And all is done Then let the trumpets sound

The tucket sonance and the note to mount

For our approach shall so much dare the field

That England shall couch down in fear and yield

They have said their prayers and they stay for death

I stay but for my guard On to the field

I will the banner from a trumpet take

And use it for my haste Come come away

The sun is high and we outwear the day

 diable

Why all our ranks are broke

Disorder that hath spoiled us friend us now

Let us on heaps go offer up our lives
