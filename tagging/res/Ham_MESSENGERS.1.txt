
Save yourself my lord

The ocean overpeering of his list

Eats not the flats with more impiteous haste

Than young Laertes in a riotous head

O'erbears your officers The rabble call him lord

And as the world were now but to begin

Antiquity forgot custom not known

The ratifiers and props of every word

They cry Choose we Laertes shall be king

Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds

Laertes shall be king Laertes king
