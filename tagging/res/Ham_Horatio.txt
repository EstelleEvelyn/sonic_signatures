


Friends to this ground

A piece of him

What has this thing appeared again tonight

Tush tush 'twill not appear

Well sit we down

And let us hear Barnardo speak of this

Most like It harrows me with fear and wonder

What art thou that usurp'st this time of night

Together with that fair and warlike form

In which the majesty of buried Denmark

Did sometimes march By heaven I charge thee speak

Stay speak speak I charge thee speak

Before my God I might not this believe

Without the sensible and true avouch

Of mine own eyes

As thou art to thyself

Such was the very armor he had on

When he the ambitious Norway combated

So frowned he once when in an angry parle

He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice

'Tis strange

In what particular thought to work I know not

But in the gross and scope of mine opinion

This bodes some strange eruption to our state

That can I

At least the whisper goes so our last king

Whose image even but now appeared to us

Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway

Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride

Dared to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet

For so this side of our known world esteemed him

Did slay this Fortinbras who by a sealed compact

Well ratified by law and heraldry

Did forfeit with his life all those his lands

Which he stood seized of to the conqueror

Against the which a moiety competent

Was gagd by our king which had returned

To the inheritance of Fortinbras

Had he been vanquisher as by the same comart

And carriage of the article designed

His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras

Of unimprovd mettle hot and full

Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there

Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes

For food and diet to some enterprise

That hath a stomach in 't which is no other

As it doth well appear unto our state

But to recover of us by strong hand

And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands

So by his father lost And this I take it

Is the main motive of our preparations

The source of this our watch and the chief head

Of this posthaste and rummage in the land

A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye

In the most high and palmy state of Rome

A little ere the mightiest Julius fell

The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead

Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets

As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood

Disasters in the sun and the moist star

Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands

Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse

And even the like precurse of feared events

As harbingers preceding still the fates

And prologue to the omen coming on

Have heaven and Earth together demonstrated

Unto our climatures and countrymen

But soft behold Lo where it comes again

I'll cross it though it blast meStay illusion

If thou hast any sound or use of voice

Speak to me

If there be any good thing to be done

That may to thee do ease and grace to me

Speak to me

If thou art privy to thy country's fate

Which happily foreknowing may avoid

O speak

Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life

Extorted treasure in the womb of earth

For which they say you spirits oft walk in death

Speak of it Stay and speakStop it Marcellus

Do if it will not stand

'Tis here

And then it started like a guilty thing

Upon a fearful summons I have heard

The cock that is the trumpet to the morn

Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat

Awake the god of day and at his warning

Whether in sea or fire in earth or air

Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies

To his confine and of the truth herein

This present object made probation

So have I heard and do in part believe it

But look the morn in russet mantle clad

Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill

Break we our watch up and by my advice

Let us impart what we have seen tonight

Unto young Hamlet for upon my life

This spirit dumb to us will speak to him

Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it

As needful in our loves fitting our duty

Hail to your Lordship

The same my lord and your poor servant ever

A truant disposition good my lord

My lord I came to see your father's funeral

Indeed my lord it followed hard upon

Where my lord

I saw him once He was a goodly king

My lord I think I saw him yesternight

My lord the King your father

Season your admiration for a while

With an attent ear till I may deliver

Upon the witness of these gentlemen

This marvel to you

Two nights together had these gentlemen

Marcellus and Barnardo on their watch

In the dead waste and middle of the night

Been thus encountered a figure like your father

Armed at point exactly cap--pie

Appears before them and with solemn march

Goes slow and stately by them Thrice he walked

By their oppressed and fear-surprisd eyes

Within his truncheon's length whilst they distilled

Almost to jelly with the act of fear

Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me

In dreadful secrecy impart they did

And I with them the third night kept the watch

Where as they had delivered both in time

Form of the thing each word made true and good

The apparition comes I knew your father

These hands are not more like

My lord I did

But answer made it none Yet once methought

It lifted up its head and did address

Itself to motion like as it would speak

But even then the morning cock crew loud

And at the sound it shrunk in haste away

And vanished from our sight

As I do live my honored lord 'tis true

And we did think it writ down in our duty

To let you know of it

We do my lord

Armed my lord

My lord from head to foot

O yes my lord he wore his beaver up

A countenance more in sorrow than in anger

Nay very pale

Most constantly

It would have much amazed you

While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred

Not when I saw 't

It was as I have seen it in his life

A sable silvered

I warrant it will

Our duty to your Honor

It is a nipping and an eager air

I think it lacks of twelve

Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season

Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk

What does this mean my lord

Is it a custom

Look my lord it comes

It beckons you to go away with it

As if it some impartment did desire

To you alone

No by no means

Do not my lord

What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord

Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff

That beetles o'er his base into the sea

And there assume some other horrible form

Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason

And draw you into madness Think of it

The very place puts toys of desperation

Without more motive into every brain

That looks so many fathoms to the sea

And hears it roar beneath

Be ruled You shall not go

He waxes desperate with imagination

Have after To what issue will this come

Heaven will direct it

My lord my lord

Heavens secure him

What news my lord

Good my lord tell it

Not I my lord by heaven

 Ay by heaven my lord

There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave

To tell us this

These are but wild and whirling words my lord

There's no offense my lord

What is 't my lord We will

 My lord we will not

In faith my lord not I

Propose the oath my lord

O day and night but this is wondrous strange

Here sweet lord at your service

O my dear lord

Well my lord

If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing

And 'scape detecting I will pay the theft

Half a share

You might have rhymed

Very well my lord

I did very well note him

'Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew

Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds

What are they that would speak with me

Let them come in I do not

know from what part of the world I should be

greeted if not from Lord Hamlet

Let Him bless thee too

Horatio when thou shalt have

overlooked this give these fellows some means to the

King They have letters for him Ere we were two days

old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave

us chase Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on

a compelled valor and in the grapple I boarded them

On the instant they got clear of our ship so I alone

became their prisoner They have dealt with me like

thieves of mercy but they knew what they did I am to

do a good turn for them Let the King have the letters

I have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed

as thou wouldst fly death I have words to speak in

thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too

light for the bore of the matter These good fellows

will bring thee where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

hold their course for England of them I have

much to tell thee Farewell

He that thou knowest thine

Hamlet

Come I will give you way for these your letters

And do 't the speedier that you may direct me

To him from whom you brought them

Custom hath made it in him a property of

easiness

It might my lord

Ay my lord

Not a jot more my lord

Ay my lord and of calves' skins too

What's that my lord

E'en so

E'en so my lord

'Twere to consider too curiously to consider

so

Good my lord be quiet

Remember it my lord

That is most certain

Is 't possible

I beseech you

Ay good my lord

How was this sealed

So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't

Why what a king is this

It must be shortly known to him from England

What is the issue of the business there

Peace who comes here

No my good lord

Is 't not possible to understand in another

tongue You will to 't sir really

His purse is empty already all 's golden words

are spent

I knew you must be edified by the margent

ere you had done

This lapwing runs away with the shell on his

head

You will lose my lord

Nay good my lord

If your mind dislike anything obey it I will

forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit

They bleed on both sidesHow is it my lord

Never believe it

I am more an antique Roman than a Dane

Here's yet some liquor left

Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince

And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest

Why does the drum come hither

What is it you would see

If aught of woe or wonder cease your search

Not from his mouth

Had it th' ability of life to thank you

He never gave commandment for their death

But since so jump upon this bloody question

You from the Polack wars and you from England

Are here arrived give order that these bodies

High on a stage be placed to the view

And let me speak to th' yet unknowing world

How these things came about So shall you hear

Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts

Of accidental judgments casual slaughters

Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause

And in this upshot purposes mistook

Fall'n on th' inventors' heads All this can I

Truly deliver

Of that I shall have also cause to speak

And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more

But let this same be presently performed

Even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance

On plots and errors happen
