Full of vexation come I with complaint

Against my child my daughter Hermia

Stand forth DemetriusMy noble lord

This man hath my consent to marry her

Stand forth LysanderAnd my gracious duke

This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child

Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes

And interchanged love tokens with my child

Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung

With feigning voice verses of feigning love

And stol'n the impression of her fantasy

With bracelets of thy hair rings gauds conceits

Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeatsmessengers

Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth

With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart

Turned her obedience which is due to me

To stubborn harshnessAnd my gracious duke

Be it so she will not here before your Grace

Consent to marry with Demetrius

I beg the ancient privilege of Athens

As she is mine I may dispose of her

Which shall be either to this gentleman

Or to her death according to our law

Immediately provided in that case

Scornful Lysander true he hath my love

And what is mine my love shall render him

And she is mine and all my right of her

I do estate unto Demetrius

With duty and desire we follow you

My lord this is my daughter here asleep

And this Lysander this Demetrius is

This Helena old Nedar's Helena

I wonder of their being here together

It is my lord

Enough enoughMy lord you have enough

I beg the law the law upon his head

They would have stol'n awayThey would Demetrius

Thereby to have defeated you and me

You of your wife and me of my consent

Of my consent that she should be your wife
