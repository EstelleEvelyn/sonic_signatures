Contending with the fretful elements;

Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea

Or swell the curlèd waters ’bove the main,

That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,

Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage

Catch in their fury and make nothing of;

Strives in his little world of man to outscorn

The to-and-fro conflicting wind and rain.

This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,

The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf

Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs

And bids what will take all.

None but the Fool, who labors to outjest

His heart-struck injuries.

I will talk further with you.

Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?
