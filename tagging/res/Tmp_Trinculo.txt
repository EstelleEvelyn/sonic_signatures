


Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off

any weather at all And another storm brewing I

hear it sing i' th' wind Yond same black cloud yond

huge one looks like a foul bombard that would shed

his liquor If it should thunder as it did before I

know not where to hide my head Yond same cloud

cannot choose but fall by pailfuls

What have we here a man or a fish Dead or

alive A fish he smells like a fisha very ancient

and fishlike smell a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John

A strange fish Were I in England now as once

I was and had but this fish painted not a holiday

fool there but would give a piece of silver There

would this monster make a man Any strange beast

there makes a man When they will not give a doit to

relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a

dead Indian Legged like a man and his fins like

arms Warm o' my troth I do now let loose my

opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an

islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt

Alas the storm is come again My best

way is to creep under his gaberdine There is no

other shelter hereabout Misery acquaints a man

with strange bedfellows I will here shroud till the

dregs of the storm be past

I should know that voice It should bebut

he is drowned and these are devils O defend me

Stephano

Stephano If thou be'st Stephano touch me

and speak to me for I am Trinculobe not

afeardthy good friend Trinculo

I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke

But art thou not drowned Stephano I

hope now thou art not drowned Is the storm

overblown I hid me under the dead mooncalf's

gaberdine for fear of the storm And art thou living

Stephano O Stephano two Neapolitans scaped

Swum ashore man like a duck I can swim

like a duck I'll be sworn

O Stephano hast any more of this

By this good light this is a very shallow

monster I afeard of him A very weak monster The

man i' th' moon A most poor credulous monster

Well drawn monster in good sooth

By this light a most perfidious and drunken

monster When 's god's asleep he'll rob his bottle

I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed

monster A most scurvy monster I could

find in my heart to beat him

but that the poor monster's in drink An

abominable monster

A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder

of a poor drunkard

A howling monster a drunken monster

Servant monster The folly of this island

They say there's but five upon this isle we are three

of them If th' other two be brained like us the state

totters

Where should they be set else He were a

brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail

Your lieutenant if you list He's no

standard

Nor go neither But you'll lie like dogs and

yet say nothing neither

Thou liest most ignorant monster I am in

case to justle a constable Why thou debauched

fish thou Was there ever man a coward that hath

drunk so much sack as I today Wilt thou tell a

monstrous lie being but half a fish and half a

monster

Lord quoth he That a monster should be

such a natural

Why I said nothing

Why what did I I did nothing I'll go

farther off

I did not give the lie Out o' your wits and

hearing too A pox o' your bottle This can sack and

drinking do A murrain on your monster and the

devil take your fingers

Excellent

This is the tune of our catch played by the

picture of Nobody

O forgive me my sins

The sound is going away Let's follow it and

after do our work

I'll follow Stephano

Monster I do smell all horse piss at which

my nose is in great indignation

Thou wert but a lost monster

Ay but to lose our bottles in the pool

That's more to me than my wetting Yet this

is your harmless fairy monster

O King Stephano O

peer O worthy Stephano look what a wardrobe

here is for thee

Oho monster we know what belongs to a

frippery O King

Stephano

Thy Grace shall have it

Do do We steal by line and level an 't like

your Grace

Monster come put some lime upon your

fingers and away with the rest

And this

If these be true spies which I wear in my

head here's a goodly sight

I have been in such a pickle since I saw you

last that I fear me will never out of my bones I

shall not fear flyblowing
