


Good Lord Boyet my beauty though but mean

Needs not the painted flourish of your praise

Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye

Not uttered by base sale of chapmen's tongues

I am less proud to hear you tell my worth

Than you much willing to be counted wise

In spending your wit in the praise of mine

But now to task the tasker good Boyet

You are not ignorant all-telling fame

Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow

Till painful study shall outwear three years

No woman may approach his silent court

Therefore to 's seemeth it a needful course

Before we enter his forbidden gates

To know his pleasure and in that behalf

Bold of your worthiness we single you

As our best-moving fair solicitor

Tell him the daughter of the King of France

On serious business craving quick dispatch

Importunes personal conference with his Grace

Haste signify so much while we attend

Like humble-visaged suitors his high will

All pride is willing pride and yours is so

Who are the votaries my loving lords

That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke

Know you the man

Some merry mocking lord belike Is 't so

Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow

Who are the rest

God bless my ladies are they all in love

That every one her own hath garnishd

With such bedecking ornaments of praise

Now what admittance lord

Fair I give you back again and welcome

I have not yet The roof of this court is too

high to be yours and welcome to the wide fields too

base to be mine

I will be welcome then Conduct me thither

Our Lady help my lord He'll be forsworn

Why will shall break it will and nothing else

Were my lord so his ignorance were wise

Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance

I hear your Grace hath sworn out housekeeping

'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord

And sin to break it

But pardon me I am too sudden bold

To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me

Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming

And suddenly resolve me in my suit

You will the sooner that I were away

For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay

You do the King my father too much wrong

And wrong the reputation of your name

In so unseeming to confess receipt

Of that which hath so faithfully been paid

We arrest your word

Boyet you can produce acquittances

For such a sum from special officers

Of Charles his father

Sweet health and fair desires consort your Grace

It was well done of you to take him at his word

Good wits will be jangling but gentles agree

This civil war of wits were much better used

On Navarre and his bookmen for here 'tis abused

With what

Your reason

Come to our pavilion Boyet is disposed

Was that the King that spurred his horse so hard

Against the steep uprising of the hill

Whoe'er he was he showed a mounting mind

Well lords today we shall have our dispatch

Or Saturday we will return to France

Then forester my friend where is the bush

That we must stand and play the murderer in

I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot

And thereupon thou speakst the fairest shoot

What what First praise me and again say no

O short-lived pride Not fair Alack for woe

Nay never paint me now

Where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow

Here good my glass take this for telling true

Fair payment for foul words is more than due

See see my beauty will be saved by merit

O heresy in fair fit for these days

A giving hand though foul shall have fair praise

But come the bow Now mercy goes to kill

And shooting well is then accounted ill

Thus will I save my credit in the shoot

Not wounding pity would not let me do 't

If wounding then it was to show my skill

That more for praise than purpose meant to kill

And out of question so it is sometimes

Glory grows guilty of detested crimes

When for fame's sake for praise an outward part

We bend to that the working of the heart

As I for praise alone now seek to spill

The poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill

Only for praise and praise we may afford

To any lady that subdues a lord

Thou shalt know her fellow by the rest that

have no heads

The thickest and the tallest

What's your will sir What's your will

O thy letter thy letter He's a good friend of mine

Stand aside good bearerBoyet you can carve

Break up this capon

We will read it I swear

Break the neck of the wax and everyone give ear

What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter

What vane What weathercock Did you ever hear better

Else your memory is bad going o'er it erewhile

Thou fellow a word

Who gave thee this letter

To whom shouldst thou give it

From which lord to which lady

Thou hast mistaken his letter Come lords away

Here sweet put up this 'twill be thine another day

Sweethearts we shall be rich ere we depart

If fairings come thus plentifully in

A lady walled about with diamonds

Look you what I have from the loving king

Nothing but this Yes as much love in rhyme

As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper

Writ o' both sides the leaf margent and all

That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name

Well bandied both a set of wit well played

But Rosaline you have a favor too

Who sent it And what is it

Anything like

Beauteous as ink a good conclusion

A pox of that jest And I beshrew all shrows

But Katherine what was sent to you

From fair Dumaine

Did he not send you twain

I think no less Dost thou not wish in heart

The chain were longer and the letter short

We are wise girls to mock our lovers so

None are so surely caught when they are catched

As wit turned fool Folly in wisdom hatched

Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school

And wit's own grace to grace a learnd fool

Here comes Boyet and mirth is in his face

Thy news Boyet

Saint Denis to Saint Cupid What are they

That charge their breath against us Say scout say

But what but what Come they to visit us

And will they so The gallants shall be tasked

For ladies we will every one be masked

And not a man of them shall have the grace

Despite of suit to see a lady's face

Hold Rosaline this favor thou shalt wear

And then the King will court thee for his dear

Hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine

So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline

And change you favors too So shall your loves

Woo contrary deceived by these removes

The effect of my intent is to cross theirs

They do it but in mockery merriment

And mock for mock is only my intent

Their several counsels they unbosom shall

To loves mistook and so be mocked withal

Upon the next occasion that we meet

With visages displayed to talk and greet

No to the death we will not move a foot

Nor to their penned speech render we no grace

But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face

Therefore I do it and I make no doubt

The rest will ne'er come in if he be out

There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown

To make theirs ours and ours none but our own

So shall we stay mocking intended game

And they well mocked depart away with shame

Honey and milk and sugarthere is three

Seventh sweet adieu

Since you can cog I'll play no more with you

Let it not be sweet

Gall Bitter

Twenty adieus my frozen Muskovits

Are these the breed of wits so wondered at

O poverty in wit kingly-poor flout

Will they not think you hang themselves tonight

Or ever but in vizards show their faces

This pert Berowne was out of count'nance quite

Berowne did swear himself out of all suit

Qualm perhaps

Go sickness as thou art

And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me

Will they return

How blow How blow Speak to be understood

Avaunt perplexityWhat shall we do

If they return in their own shapes to woo

Whip to our tents as roes runs o'er land

Fair in all hail is foul as I conceive

Then wish me better I will give you leave

This field shall hold me and so hold your vow

Nor God nor I delights in perjured men

You nickname virtue vice you should have spoke

For virtue's office never breaks men's troth

Now by my maiden honor yet as pure

As the unsullied lily I protest

A world of torments though I should endure

I would not yield to be your house's guest

So much I hate a breaking cause to be

Of heavenly oaths vowed with integrity

Not so my lord It is not so I swear

We have had pastimes here and pleasant game

A mess of Russians left us but of late

Ay in truth my lord

Trim gallants full of courtship and of state

Amazed my lord Why looks your Highness sad

No they are free that gave these tokens to us

The fairest is confession

Were not you here but even now disguised

And were you well advised

When you then were here

What did you whisper in your lady's ear

When she shall challenge this you will reject her

Peace peace forbear

Your oath once broke you force not to forswear

I will and therefore keep itRosaline

What did the Russian whisper in your ear

God give thee joy of him The noble lord

Most honorably doth uphold his word

Pardon me sir This jewel did she wear

And Lord Berowne I thank him is my dear

What will you have me or your pearl again

Nay my good lord let me o'errule you now

That sport best pleases that doth least know how

Where zeal strives to content and the contents

Dies in the zeal of that which it presents

Their form confounded makes most form in mirth

When great things laboring perish in their birth

Doth this man serve God

He speaks not like a man of God his making

Great thanks great Pompey

The conqueror is dismayedProceed good Alexander

Stand aside good Pompey

Alas poor Maccabaeus how hath he been baited

Speak brave Hector We are much delighted

Welcome Marcade

But that thou interruptest our merriment

Dead for my life

Boyet prepare I will away tonight

Prepare I sayI thank you gracious lords

For all your fair endeavors and entreat

Out of a new-sad soul that you vouchsafe

In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide

The liberal opposition of our spirits

If overboldly we have borne ourselves

In the converse of breath your gentleness

Was guilty of it Farewell worthy lord

A heavy heart bears not a humble tongue

Excuse me so coming too short of thanks

For my great suit so easily obtained

I understand you not My griefs are double

We have received your letters full of love

Your favors the ambassadors of love

And in our maiden council rated them

At courtship pleasant jest and courtesy

As bombast and as lining to the time

But more devout than this in our respects

Have we not been and therefore met your loves

In their own fashion like a merriment

A time methinks too short

To make a world-without-end bargain in

No no my lord your Grace is perjured much

Full of dear guiltiness and therefore this

If for my loveas there is no such cause

You will do aught this shall you do for me

Your oath I will not trust but go with speed

To some forlorn and naked hermitage

Remote from all the pleasures of the world

There stay until the twelve celestial signs

Have brought about the annual reckoning

If this austere insociable life

Change not your offer made in heat of blood

If frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds

Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love

But that it bear this trial and last love

Then at the expiration of the year

Come challenge me challenge me by these deserts

And by this virgin palm now kissing thine

I will be thine And till that instant shut

My woeful self up in a mourning house

Raining the tears of lamentation

For the remembrance of my father's death

If this thou do deny let our hands part

Neither entitled in the other's heart

Ay sweet my lord and so I take my leave

Was not that Hector
