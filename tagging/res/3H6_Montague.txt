


And brother here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood

Whom I encountered as the battles joined

Good brother as thou lov'st and honorest arms

Let's fight it out and not stand caviling thus

And I unto the sea from whence I came

But I have reasons strong and forcible

Brother I go I'll win them fear it not

And thus most humbly I do take my leave

Yet to have joined with France in such alliance

Would more have strengthened this our commonwealth

'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage

But the safer when 'tis backed with France

So God help Montague as he proves true

Comfort my lord and so I take my leave

Montague Montague for Lancaster
