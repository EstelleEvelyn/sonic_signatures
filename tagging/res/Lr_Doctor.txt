Our foster nurse of nature is repose

The which he lacks That to provoke in him

Are many simples operative whose power

Will close the eye of anguish

Madam sleeps still

So please your Majesty

That we may wake the King He hath slept long

Be by good madam when we do awake him

I doubt not of his temperance

Please you draw nearLouder the music there

Madam do you 'tis fittest

He's scarce awake Let him alone awhile

Be comforted good madam The great rage

You see is killed in him and yet it is danger

To make him even o'er the time he has lost

Desire him to go in Trouble him no more

Till further settling
