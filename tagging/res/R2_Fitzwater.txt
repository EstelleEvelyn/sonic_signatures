


If that thy valor stand on sympathy

There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine

By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st

I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spak'st it

That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death

If thou deniest it twenty times thou liest

And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart

Where it was forgd with my rapier's point

Now by my soul I would it were this hour

'Tis very true You were in presence then

And you can witness with me this is true

Surrey thou liest

How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse

If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live

I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness

And spit upon him whilst I say he lies

And lies and lies There is my bond of faith

To tie thee to my strong correction

As I intend to thrive in this new world

Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal

Besides I heard the banished Norfolk say

That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men

To execute the noble duke at Calais

My lord I have from Oxford sent to London

The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely

Two of the dangerous consorted traitors

That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow
