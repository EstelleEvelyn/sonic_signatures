the approach of day.

He hath not told his thought to the King?

He may show what outward courage he will,

but I believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could wish

himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would

he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were

quit here.

Then I would he were here alone; so should he

be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men’s

lives saved.

Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we

know enough if we know we are the King’s subjects.

If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the

King wipes the crime of it out of us.

I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet

I determine to fight lustily for him.

Be friends, you English fools, be friends. We

have French quarrels enough, if you could tell how

to reckon.
