


And living too for now his son is duke

My heart is great but it must break with silence

Ere 't be disburdened with a liberal tongue

No good at all that I can do for him

Unless you call it good to pity him

Bereft and gelded of his patrimony

The commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes

And quite lost their hearts The nobles hath he fined

For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts

The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm

He hath not money for these Irish wars

His burdenous taxations notwithstanding

But by the robbing of the banished duke

We see the very wrack that we must suffer

And unavoided is the danger now

For suffering so the causes of our wrack

Be confident to speak Northumberland

We three are but thyself and speaking so

Thy words are but as thoughts Therefore be bold

To horse to horse Urge doubts to them that fear

Your presence makes us rich most noble lord

It stands your Grace upon to do him right
