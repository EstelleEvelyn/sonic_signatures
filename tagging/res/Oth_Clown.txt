Naples that they speak i' th' nose thus

Are these I pray you wind instruments

O thereby hangs a tail

Marry sir by many a wind instrument that I

know But masters here's money for you and the

General so likes your music that he desires you for

love's sake to make no more noise with it

If you have any music that may not be heard to

't again But as they say to hear music the General

does not greatly care

Then put up your pipes in your bag for I'll

away Go vanish into air away

No I hear not your honest friend I hear you

She is stirring sir If she will stir hither I shall

seem to notify unto her

I dare not say he lies anywhere

He's a soldier and for me to say a soldier lies

'tis stabbing

To tell you where he lodges is to tell you

where I lie

I know not where he lodges and for me to

devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies

there were to lie in mine own throat

I will catechize the world for himthat is

make questions and by them answer

To do this is within the compass of man's wit

and therefore I will attempt the doing it
