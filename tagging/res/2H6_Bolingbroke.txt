Will her Ladyship behold and hear our

exorcisms

I have heard her reported to be a

woman of an invincible spirit But it shall be convenient

Master Hume that you be by her aloft

while we be busy below and so I pray you go in

God's name and leave us

Mother Jourdain be you prostrate and grovel on

the earth John Southwell

read you and let us to our work

Patience good lady Wizards know their times

Deep night dark night the silent of the night

The time of night when Troy was set on fire

The time when screech owls cry and bandogs howl

And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves

That time best fits the work we have in hand

Madam sit you and fear not Whom we raise

We will make fast within a hallowed verge

First of the King What shall of him become

What fates await the Duke of Suffolk

What shall befall the Duke of Somerset

Descend to darkness and the burning lake

False fiend avoid
