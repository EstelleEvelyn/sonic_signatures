


Well I hope it be not so

Why sir my wife is not young

Love my wife

What name sir

I will be patient I will find out this

I will seek out Falstaff

If I do find itwell

'Twas a good sensible fellowwell

I melancholy I am not melancholy Get you

home Go

You heard what this knave told me did you not

Do you think there is truth in them

Were they his men

I like it never the better for that Does he lie at

the Garter

I do not misdoubt my wife but I would be loath

to turn them together A man may be too confident

I would have nothing lie on my head I cannot

be thus satisfied

Good mine Host o' th' Garter a word with you

None I protest But I'll give you a pottle of

burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him

my name is Brookonly for a jest

Though Page be a secure fool and stands so

firmly on his wife's frailty yet I cannot put off my

opinion so easily She was in his company at Page's

house and what they made there I know not Well

I will look further into 't and I have a disguise to

sound Falstaff If I find her honest I lose not my

labor If she be otherwise 'tis labor well bestowed

God bless you sir

I make bold to press with so little

preparation upon you

Sir I am a gentleman that have spent

much My name is Brook

Good Sir John I sue for yoursnot

to charge you for I must let you understand I

think myself in better plight for a lender than you

are the which hath something emboldened me to

this unseasoned intrusion for they say if money

go before all ways do lie open

Troth and I have a bag of money

here troubles me If you will help

to bear it Sir John take all or half for easing me

of the carriage

I will tell you sir if you will give me

the hearing

Sir I hear you are a scholarI will

be brief with youand you have been a man long

known to me though I had never so good means

as desire to make myself acquainted with you I

shall discover a thing to you wherein I must very

much lay open mine own imperfection But good

Sir John as you have one eye upon my follies as

you hear them unfolded turn another into the register

of your own that I may pass with a reproof

the easier sith you yourself know how easy it is to

be such an offender

There is a gentlewoman in this

townher husband's name is Ford

I have long loved her and I protest

to you bestowed much on her followed her with

a doting observance engrossed opportunities to

meet her fee'd every slight occasion that could but

niggardly give me sight of her not only bought

many presents to give her but have given largely to

many to know what she would have given Briefly

I have pursued her as love hath pursued me which

hath been on the wing of all occasions But whatsoever

I have merited either in my mind or in my

means meed I am sure I have received none unless

experience be a jewel That I have purchased

at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say

this

Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues

Pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues

Never

Never

Like a fair house built on another

man's ground so that I have lost my edifice by

mistaking the place where I erected it

When I have told you that I have

told you all Some say that though she appear honest

to me yet in other places she enlargeth her

mirth so far that there is shrewd construction

made of her Now Sir John here is the heart of my

purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding

admirable discourse of great admittance

authentic in your place and person generally

allowed for your many warlike courtlike and

learned preparations

Believe it for you know it There is

money Spend it spend

it spend more spend all I have Only give me so

much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an

amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife

Use your art of wooing win her to consent to you

If any man may you may as soon as any

O understand my drift She dwells

so securely on the excellency of her honor that the

folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too

bright to be looked against Now could I come to

her with any detection in my hand my desires had

instance and argument to commend themselves I

could drive her then from the ward of her purity

her reputation her marriage vow and a thousand

other her defenses which now are too too strongly

embattled against me What say you to 't Sir

John

O good sir

Want no money Sir John you shall

want none

I am blessed in your acquaintance

Do you know Ford sir

I would you knew Ford sir that you

might avoid him if you saw him

What a damned epicurean rascal is this My

heart is ready to crack with impatience Who says

this is improvident jealousy My wife hath sent

to him the hour is fixed the match is made

Would any man have thought this See the hell of

having a false woman my bed shall be abused my

coffers ransacked my reputation gnawn at And

I shall not only receive this villainous wrong but

stand under the adoption of abominable terms

and by him that does me this wrong Terms

names Amaimon sounds well Lucifer well

Barbason well yet they are devils' additions the

names of fiends But Cuckold Wittoll Cuckold

The devil himself hath not such a name Page

is an ass a secure ass He will trust his wife he will

not be jealous I will rather trust a Fleming with

my butter Parson Hugh the Welshman with my

cheese an Irishman with my aquavitae bottle or

a thief to walk my ambling gelding than my wife

with herself Then she plots then she ruminates

then she devises and what they think in their

hearts they may effect they will break their hearts

but they will effect God be praised for my jealousy

Eleven o'clock the hour I will prevent this

detect my wife be revenged on Falstaff and laugh

at Page I will about it Better three hours too soon

than a minute too late Fie fie fie Cuckold cuckold

cuckold

Well met Mistress Page Whither go you

Ay and as idle as she may hang together for

want of company I think if your husbands were

dead you two would marry

Where had you this pretty weathercock

Sir John Falstaff

Indeed she is

Has Page any brains Hath he any eyes Hath

he any thinking Sure they sleep he hath no use

of them Why this boy will carry a letter twenty

mile as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank

twelve score He pieces out his wife's inclination

He gives her folly motion and advantage And now

she's going to my wife and Falstaff's boy with her

A man may hear this shower sing in the wind And

Falstaff's boy with her Good plots they are laid

and our revolted wives share damnation together

Well I will take him then torture my wife pluck

the borrowed veil of modesty from the so-seeming

Mistress Page divulge Page himself for a secure

and willful Acteon and to these violent proceedings

all my neighbors shall cry aim

The clock gives me my cue and my assurance

bids me search There I shall find Falstaff I

shall be rather praised for this than mocked for it

is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is

there I will go

Trust me a good knot I have good cheer at

home and I pray you all go with me

I beseech you heartily some of you go home

with me to dinner Besides your cheer you shall

determination

What while you were there

And did he search for you and could

not find you

A buck-basket

And how long lay you there

In good sadness sir I am sorry that

for my sake you have suffered all this My suit

then is desperate You'll undertake her no more

'Tis past eight already sir

Hum Ha Is this a vision Is this a dream Do I

There's a hole made in your best coat Master

Ford This 'tis to be married this 'tis to have linen

and buck-baskets Well I will proclaim myself

what I am I will now take the lecher He is at my

house He cannot 'scape me 'Tis impossible he

should He cannot creep into a half-penny purse

nor into a pepper-box But lest the devil that

guides him should aid him I will search impossible

places Though what I am I cannot avoid yet to

be what I would not shall not make me tame If I

have horns to make one mad let the proverb go

with me I'll be horn-mad

Ay but if it prove true Master Page have you

reasonablePluck me out all the linen

walnut for his wife's leman Satisfy me once

more Once more search with me

Old woman What old woman's that

A witch a quean an old cozening quean Have

I not forbid her my house She comes of errands

does she We are simple men we do not know

what's brought to pass under the profession of

fortune-telling She works by charms by spells by

th' figure and such daubery as this is beyond our

element We know nothing Come down you

witch you hag you Come down I say

I'll pratt her Out of my

door you witch you rag you baggage you polecat

See but the issue of my jealousy If I cry out

thus upon no trail never trust me when I open

again

Pardon me wife Henceforth do what thou wilt

I rather will suspect the sun with cold

Than thee with wantonness Now doth thy honor stand

In him that was of late an heretic

As firm as faith

There is no better way than that they spoke of

And till he tell the truth

Let the supposd fairies pinch him sound

And burn him with their tapers

The children must

Be practiced well to this or they'll ne'er do 't

That will be excellent I'll go buy them vizards

Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook

He'll tell me all his purpose Sure he'll come

Went you not to her yesterday sir as

you told me you had appointed

Now sir who's a cuckold now

Master Brook Falstaff's a knave a cuckoldly

knave Here are his horns Master Brook And

Master Brook he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's

but his buck-basket his cudgel and twenty

pounds of money which must be paid to Master

Brook His horses are arrested for it Master

Brook

Ay and an ox too Both the proofs are extant

Well said Fairy Hugh

I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art

able to woo her in good English

What a hodge-pudding A bag of flax

And one that is as slanderous as Satan

And as wicked as his wife

Marry sir we'll bring you to Windsor to one

Master Brook that you have cozened of money

to whom you should have been a pander Over and

above that you have suffered I think to repay that

money will be a biting affliction

This is strange Who hath got the right Anne

Stand not amazed Here is no remedy

In love the heavens themselves do guide the state

Money buys lands and wives are sold by fate

Let it be so Sir John

To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word

For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford
