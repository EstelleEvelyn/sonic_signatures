the way to Master Jew’s?

Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is

the way to Master Jew’s?

Be God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit.

Can you tell me whether one Lancelet, that dwells

with him, dwell with him or no?

No master, sir, but a poor man’s son. His

father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor

man and, God be thanked, well to live.

Your Worship’s friend, and Lancelet, sir.

Of Lancelet, an ’t please your mastership.

Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff

of my age, my very prop.

Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.

But I pray you tell me, is my boy, God rest his

soul, alive or dead?

Alack, sir, I am sandblind. I know you not.

Pray you, sir, stand up! I am sure you are not

Lancelet my boy.

I cannot think you are my son.

Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if

thou be Lancelet, thou art mine own flesh and

blood. Lord worshiped might He be, what a beard

hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin

than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou

and thy master agree? I have brought him a present.

How ’gree you now?

God bless your Worship.

Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy—

He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say,

to serve—

His master and he (saving your Worship’s

reverence) are scarce cater-cousins—

I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow

upon your Worship, and my suit is—

That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
