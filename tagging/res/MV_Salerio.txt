
I did, my lord,

And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio

Commends him to you.

Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,

Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there

Will show you his estate.

I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.

Not one, my lord.

Besides, it should appear that if he had

The present money to discharge the Jew,

He would not take it. Never did I know

A creature that did bear the shape of man

So keen and greedy to confound a man.

He plies the Duke at morning and at night,

And doth impeach the freedom of the state

If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,

The Duke himself, and the magnificoes

Of greatest port have all persuaded with him,

But none can drive him from the envious plea

Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.

He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.

My lord, here stays without

A messenger with letters from the doctor,

New come from Padua.
