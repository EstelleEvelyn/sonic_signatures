


Verona for a while I take my leave

To see my friends in Padua but of all

My best belovd and approvd friend

Hortensio And I trow this is his house

Here sirrah Grumio knock I say

Villain I say knock me here soundly

Villain I say knock me at this gate

And rap me well or I'll knock your knave's pate

Will it not be

Faith sirrah an you'll not knock I'll ring it

I'll try how you can sol fa and sing it

Now knock when I bid you sirrah

villain

Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray

Con tutto il cuore ben trovato may I say

A senseless villain good Hortensio

I bade the rascal knock upon your gate

And could not get him for my heart to do it

Sirrah begone or talk not I advise you

Such wind as scatters young men through the world

To seek their fortunes farther than at home

Where small experience grows But in a few

Signior Hortensio thus it stands with me

Antonio my father is deceased

And I have thrust myself into this maze

Happily to wive and thrive as best I may

Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home

And so am come abroad to see the world

Signior Hortensio 'twixt such friends as we

Few words suffice And therefore if thou know

One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife

As wealth is burden of my wooing dance

Be she as foul as was Florentius' love

As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd

As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse

She moves me not or not removes at least

Affection's edge in me were she as rough

As are the swelling Adriatic seas

I come to wive it wealthily in Padua

If wealthily then happily in Padua

Hortensio peace Thou know'st not gold's effect

Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough

For I will board her though she chide as loud

As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack

I know her father though I know not her

And he knew my deceasd father well

I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her

And therefore let me be thus bold with you

To give you over at this first encounter

Unless you will accompany me thither

Peace sirrah

I know she is an irksome brawling scold

If that be all masters I hear no harm

Born in Verona old Antonio's son

My father dead my fortune lives for me

And I do hope good days and long to see

Will I live

Why came I hither but to that intent

Think you a little din can daunt mine ears

Have I not in my time heard lions roar

Have I not heard the sea puffed up with winds

Rage like an angry boar chafd with sweat

Have I not heard great ordnance in the field

And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies

Have I not in a pitchd battle heard

Loud 'larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang

And do you tell me of a woman's tongue

That gives not half so great a blow to hear

As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire

Tush tush fear boys with bugs

Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray

Hortensio to what end are all these words

Sir sir the first's for me let her go by

Sir understand you this of me in sooth

The youngest daughter whom you hearken for

Her father keeps from all access of suitors

And will not promise her to any man

Until the elder sister first be wed

The younger then is free and not before

And you good sir Pray have you not a daughter

Called Katherina fair and virtuous

You wrong me Signior Gremio Give me leave

I am a gentleman of Verona sir

That hearing of her beauty and her wit

Her affability and bashful modesty

Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior

Am bold to show myself a forward guest

Within your house to make mine eye the witness

Of that report which I so oft have heard

And for an entrance to my entertainment

I do present you with a man of mine

Cunning in music and the mathematics

To instruct her fully in those sciences

Whereof I know she is not ignorant

Accept of him or else you do me wrong

His name is Litio born in Mantua

I see you do not mean to part with her

Or else you like not of my company

Petruchio is my name Antonio's son

A man well known throughout all Italy

O pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing

Signior Baptista my business asketh haste

And every day I cannot come to woo

You knew my father well and in him me

Left solely heir to all his lands and goods

Which I have bettered rather than decreased

Then tell me if I get your daughter's love

What dowry shall I have with her to wife

And for that dowry I'll assure her of

Her widowhood be it that she survive me

In all my lands and leases whatsoever

Let specialties be therefore drawn between us

That covenants may be kept on either hand

Why that is nothing For I tell you father

I am as peremptory as she proud-minded

And where two raging fires meet together

They do consume the thing that feeds their fury

Though little fire grows great with little wind

Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all

So I to her and so she yields to me

For I am rough and woo not like a babe

Ay to the proof as mountains are for winds

That shakes not though they blow perpetually

Now by the world it is a lusty wench

I love her ten times more than ere I did

O how I long to have some chat with her

I pray you do I'll attend her here

And woo her with some spirit when she comes

Say that she rail why then I'll tell her plain

She sings as sweetly as a nightingale

Say that she frown I'll say she looks as clear

As morning roses newly washed with dew

Say she be mute and will not speak a word

Then I'll commend her volubility

And say she uttereth piercing eloquence

If she do bid me pack I'll give her thanks

As though she bid me stay by her a week

If she deny to wed I'll crave the day

When I shall ask the banns and when be marrid

But here she comesand now Petruchio speak

Good morrow Kate for that's your name I hear

You lie in faith for you are called plain Kate

And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst

But Kate the prettiest Kate in Christendom

Kate of Kate Hall my super-dainty Kate

For dainties are all Katesand therefore Kate

Take this of me Kate of my consolation

Hearing thy mildness praised in every town

Thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded

Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs

Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife

Why what's a movable

Thou hast hit it Come sit on me

Women are made to bear and so are you

Alas good Kate I will not burden thee

For knowing thee to be but young and light

Should beshould buzz

O slow-winged turtle shall a buzzard take thee

Come come you wasp I' faith you are too angry

My remedy is then to pluck it out

Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting

In his tail

Whose tongue

What with my tongue in your tail

Nay come again good Kate I am a gentleman

I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again

A herald Kate O put me in thy books

A combless cock so Kate will be my hen

Nay come Kate come You must not look so sour

Why here's no crab and therefore look not sour

Then show it me

What you mean my face

Now by Saint George I am too young for you

'Tis with cares

Nay hear you Katein sooth you 'scape not so

No not a whit I find you passing gentle

'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen

And now I find report a very liar

For thou art pleasant gamesome passing courteous

But slow in speech yet sweet as springtime flowers

Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance

Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will

Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk

But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers

With gentle conference soft and affable

Why does the world report that Kate doth limp

O sland'rous world Kate like the hazel twig

Is straight and slender and as brown in hue

As hazelnuts and sweeter than the kernels

O let me see thee walk Thou dost not halt

Did ever Dian so become a grove

As Kate this chamber with her princely gait

O be thou Dian and let her be Kate

And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful

It is extempore from my mother wit

Am I not wise

Marry so I mean sweet Katherine in thy bed

And therefore setting all this chat aside

Thus in plain terms your father hath consented

That you shall be my wife your dowry 'greed on

And will you nill you I will marry you

Now Kate I am a husband for your turn

For by this light whereby I see thy beauty

Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well

Thou must be married to no man but me

For I am he am born to tame you Kate

And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate

Conformable as other household Kates

Here comes your father Never make denial

I must and will have Katherine to my wife

How but well sir How but well

It were impossible I should speed amiss

Father 'tis thus yourself and all the world

That talked of her have talked amiss of her

If she be curst it is for policy

For she's not froward but modest as the dove

She is not hot but temperate as the morn

For patience she will prove a second Grissel

And Roman Lucrece for her chastity

And to conclude we have 'greed so well together

That upon Sunday is the wedding day

Be patient gentlemen I choose her for myself

If she and I be pleased what's that to you

'Tis bargained 'twixt us twain being alone

That she shall still be curst in company

I tell you 'tis incredible to believe

How much she loves me O the kindest Kate

She hung about my neck and kiss on kiss

She vied so fast protesting oath on oath

That in a twink she won me to her love

O you are novices 'Tis a world to see

How tame when men and women are alone

A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew

Give me thy hand Kate I will unto Venice

To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day

Provide the feast father and bid the guests

I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine

Father and wife and gentlemen adieu

I will to Venice Sunday comes apace

We will have rings and things and fine array

And kiss me Kate We will be married o' Sunday

Come where be these gallants Who's at home

And yet I come not well

Were it better I should rush in thus

But where is Kate Where is my lovely bride

How does my father Gentles methinks you frown

And wherefore gaze this goodly company

As if they saw some wondrous monument

Some comet or unusual prodigy

Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear

Sufficeth I am come to keep my word

Though in some part enforcd to digress

Which at more leisure I will so excuse

As you shall well be satisfied with all

But where is Kate I stay too long from her

The morning wears 'Tis time we were at church

Not I believe me Thus I'll visit her

Good sooth even thus Therefore ha' done with words

To me she's married not unto my clothes

Could I repair what she will wear in me

As I can change these poor accoutrements

'Twere well for Kate and better for myself

But what a fool am I to chat with you

When I should bid good morrow to my bride

And seal the title with a lovely kiss

Gentlemen and friends I thank you for your pains

I know you think to dine with me today

And have prepared great store of wedding cheer

But so it is my haste doth call me hence

And therefore here I mean to take my leave

I must away today before night come

Make it no wonder If you knew my business

You would entreat me rather go than stay

And honest company I thank you all

That have beheld me give away myself

To this most patient sweet and virtuous wife

Dine with my father drink a health to me

For I must hence and farewell to you all

It may not be

It cannot be

I am content

I am content you shall entreat me stay

But yet not stay entreat me how you can

Grumio my horse

O Kate content thee Prithee be not angry

They shall go forward Kate at thy command

Obey the bride you that attend on her

Go to the feast revel and domineer

Carouse full measure to her maidenhead

Be mad and merry or go hang yourselves

But for my bonny Kate she must with me

Nay look not big nor stamp nor stare nor fret

I will be master of what is mine own

She is my goods my chattels she is my house

My household stuff my field my barn

My horse my ox my ass my anything

And here she stands touch her whoever dare

I'll bring mine action on the proudest he

That stops my way in PaduaGrumio

Draw forth thy weapon We are beset with thieves

Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man

Fear not sweet wench they shall not touch thee Kate

I'll buckler thee against a million

Where be these knaves What no man at door

To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse

Where is Nathaniel Gregory Phillip

Here sir Here sir Here sir Here sir

You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms

What No attendance No regard No duty

Where is the foolish knave I sent before

You peasant swain you whoreson malt-horse drudge

Did I not bid thee meet me in the park

And bring along these rascal knaves with thee

Go rascals go and fetch my supper in

Where is the life that late I led

Where are those

Sit down Kate and welcome

Soud soud soud soud

Why when I sayNay good sweet Kate be merry

Off with my boots you rogues you villains When

It was the friar of orders gray

As he forth walkd on his way

Out you rogue You pluck my foot awry

Take that And mend the plucking of the other

Be merry KateSome water here What ho

Where's my spaniel Troilus Sirrah get you hence

And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither

One Kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with

Where are my slippers Shall I have some water

Come Kate and wash and welcome heartily

You whoreson villain will you let it fall

A whoreson beetle-headed flap-eared knave

Come Kate sit down I know you have a stomach

Will you give thanks sweet Kate or else shall I

What's this Mutton

Who brought it

'Tis burnt and so is all the meat

What dogs are these Where is the rascal cook

How durst you villains bring it from the dresser

And serve it thus to me that love it not

There take it to you trenchers cups and all

You heedless joltheads and unmannered slaves

What do you grumble I'll be with you straight

I tell thee Kate 'twas burnt and dried away

And I expressly am forbid to touch it

For it engenders choler planteth anger

And better 'twere that both of us did fast

Since of ourselves ourselves are choleric

Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh

Be patient Tomorrow 't shall be mended

And for this night we'll fast for company

Come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber

Thus have I politicly begun my reign

And 'tis my hope to end successfully

My falcon now is sharp and passing empty

And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged

For then she never looks upon her lure

Another way I have to man my haggard

To make her come and know her keeper's call

That is to watch her as we watch these kites

That bate and beat and will not be obedient

She ate no meat today nor none shall eat

Last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not

As with the meat some undeservd fault

I'll find about the making of the bed

And here I'll fling the pillow there the bolster

This way the coverlet another way the sheets

Ay and amid this hurly I intend

That all is done in reverend care of her

And in conclusion she shall watch all night

And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl

And with the clamor keep her still awake

This is a way to kill a wife with kindness

And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humor

He that knows better how to tame a shrew

Now let him speak 'tis charity to shew

How fares my Kate What sweeting all amort

Pluck up thy spirits Look cheerfully upon me

Here love thou seest how diligent I am

To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee

I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks

What not a word Nay then thou lov'st it not

And all my pains is sorted to no proof

Here take away this dish

The poorest service is repaid with thanks

And so shall mine before you touch the meat

Eat it up all Hortensio if thou lovest me

Much good do it unto thy gentle heart

Kate eat apace  And now my honey love

Will we return unto thy father's house

And revel it as bravely as the best

With silken coats and caps and golden rings

With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things

With scarves and fans and double change of brav'ry

With amber bracelets beads and all this knav'ry

What hast thou dined The tailor stays thy leisure

To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure

Come tailor let us see these ornaments

Lay forth the gown    What news with you sir

Why this was molded on a porringer

A velvet dish Fie fie 'tis lewd and filthy

Why 'tis a cockle or a walnut shell

A knack a toy a trick a baby's cap

Away with it Come let me have a bigger

When you are gentle you shall have one too

And not till then

Why thou sayst true It is a paltry cap

A custard-coffin a bauble a silken pie

I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not

Thy gown Why ay Come tailor let us see 't

O mercy God what masking-stuff is here

What's this A sleeve 'Tis like a demi-cannon

What up and down carved like an apple tart

Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash

Like to a censer in a barber's shop

Why what a devil's name tailor call'st thou this

Marry and did But if you be remembered

I did not bid you mar it to the time

Go hop me over every kennel home

For you shall hop without my custom sir

I'll none of it Hence make your best of it

Why true he means to make a puppet of thee

O monstrous arrogance Thou liest thou thread thou thimble

Thou yard three-quarters half-yard quarter nail

Thou flea thou nit thou winter cricket thou

Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread

Away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant

Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard

As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st

I tell thee I that thou hast marred her gown

Read it

Proceed

Ay there's the villainy

Well sir in brief the gown is not for me

Go take it up unto thy master's use

Why sir what's your conceit in that

Hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid

Go take it hence Begone and say no more

Well come my Kate we will unto your father's

Even in these honest mean habiliments

Our purses shall be proud our garments poor

For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich

And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds

So honor peereth in the meanest habit

What is the jay more precious than the lark

Because his feathers are more beautiful

Or is the adder better than the eel

Because his painted skin contents the eye

O no good Kate Neither art thou the worse

For this poor furniture and mean array

If thou account'st it shame lay it on me

And therefore frolic We will hence forthwith

To feast and sport us at thy father's house

Go call my men and let us straight to him

And bring our horses unto Long-lane end

There will we mount and thither walk on foot

Let's see I think 'tis now some seven o'clock

And well we may come there by dinner time

It shall be seven ere I go to horse

Look what I speak or do or think to do

You are still crossing itSirs let 't alone

I will not go today and ere I do

It shall be what o'clock I say it is

Come on i' God's name once more toward our father's

Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon

I say it is the moon that shines so bright

Now by my mother's son and that's myself

It shall be moon or star or what I list

Or e'er I journey to your father's house

Go on and fetch our horses back again

Evermore crossed and crossed nothing but crossed

I say it is the moon

Nay then you lie It is the blessd sun

Well forward forward Thus the bowl should run

And not unluckily against the bias

But soft Company is coming here

Good morrow gentle mistress where away

Tell me sweet Kate and tell me truly too

Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman

Such war of white and red within her cheeks

What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty

As those two eyes become that heavenly face

Fair lovely maid once more good day to thee

Sweet Kate embrace her for her beauty's sake

Why how now Kate I hope thou art not mad

This is a manold wrinkled faded withered

And not a maiden as thou sayst he is

Do good old grandsire and withal make known

Which way thou travelest If along with us

We shall be joyful of thy company

What is his name

Happily met the happier for thy son

And now by law as well as reverend age

I may entitle thee my loving father

The sister to my wife this gentlewoman

Thy son by this hath married Wonder not

Nor be not grieved She is of good esteem

Her dowry wealthy and of worthy birth

Beside so qualified as may beseem

The spouse of any noble gentleman

Let me embrace with old Vincentio

And wander we to see thy honest son

Who will of thy arrival be full joyous

Come go along and see the truth hereof

For our first merriment hath made thee jealous

Sir here's the door This is Lucentio's house

My father's bears more toward the marketplace

Thither must I and here I leave you sir

Nay I told you your son was

well beloved in PaduaDo you hear sir To leave

frivolous circumstances I pray you tell Signior

Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is

here at the door to speak with him

Why how now gentleman

Why this is flat knavery to take upon you another

man's name

Prithee Kate let's stand aside and see the

end of this controversy

First kiss me Kate and we will

What art thou ashamed of me

Why then let's home again Come sirrah let's away

Is not this well Come my sweet Kate

Better once than never for never too late

Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat

Padua affords nothing but what is kind

Now for my life Hortensio fears his widow

You are very sensible and yet you miss my sense

I mean Hortensio is afeard of you

Roundly replied

Conceives by me How likes Hortensio that

Very well mended Kiss him for that good widow

To her Kate

A hundred marks my Kate does put her down

Spoke like an officer Ha' to thee lad

Nay that you shall not Since you have begun

Have at you for a bitter jest or two

She hath prevented me Here Signior Tranio

This bird you aimed at though you hit her not

Therefore a health to all that shot and missed

A good swift simile but something currish

He has a little galled me I confess

And as the jest did glance away from me

'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright

Well I say no And therefore for assurance

Let's each one send unto his wife

And he whose wife is most obedient

To come at first when he doth send for her

Shall win the wager which we will propose

Twenty crowns

I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound

But twenty times so much upon my wife

A match 'Tis done

How She's busy and she cannot come

Is that an answer

I hope better

O ho entreat her

Nay then she must needs come

Worse and worse She will not come

O vile intolerable not to be endured

Sirrah Grumio go to your mistress

Say I command her come to me

What

The fouler fortune mine and there an end

Where is your sister and Hortensio's wife

Go fetch them hither If they deny to come

Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands

Away I say and bring them hither straight

Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life

An awful rule and right supremacy

And to be short what not that's sweet and happy

Nay I will win my wager better yet

And show more sign of her obedience

Her new-built virtue and obedience

See where she comes and brings your froward wives

As prisoners to her womanly persuasion

Katherine that cap of yours becomes you not

Off with that bauble throw it underfoot

Katherine I charge thee tell these headstrong women

What duty they do owe their lords and husbands

Come on I say and first begin with her

I say she shallAnd first begin with her

Why there's a wench Come on and kiss me Kate

Come Kate we'll to bed

We three are married but you two are sped

'Twas I won the wager though you hit the white

And being a winner God give you good night
