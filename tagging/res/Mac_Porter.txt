porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the

key. Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there, i’

th’ name of Beelzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged

himself on th’ expectation of plenty. Come in time!

Have napkins enough about you; here you’ll sweat

for ’t. Knock, knock! Who’s there, in th’

other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator

that could swear in both the scales against either

scale, who committed treason enough for God’s

sake yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in,

equivocator. Knock, knock, knock! Who’s

there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for

stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here

you may roast your goose. Knock, knock!

Never at quiet.—What are you?—But this place is

too cold for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further. I had

thought to have let in some of all professions that go

the primrose way to th’ everlasting bonfire.

Anon, anon!

I pray you, remember the porter.

Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second

cock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three

things.

Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.

Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes

the desire, but it takes away the performance.

Therefore much drink may be said to be an

equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it

mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it

persuades him and disheartens him; makes him

stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates

him in a sleep and, giving him the lie, leaves

him.

That it did, sir, i’ th’ very throat on me; but I

requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too

strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime,

yet I made a shift to cast him.
