


I am made of that self mettle as my sister

And prize me at her worth In my true heart

I find she names my very deed of love

Only she comes too short that I profess

Myself an enemy to all other joys

Which the most precious square of sense possesses

And find I am alone felicitate

In your dear Highness' love

Prescribe not us our duty

That's most certain and with you next month

with us

'Tis the infirmity of his age Yet he hath ever

but slenderly known himself

Such unconstant starts are we like to have

from him as this of Kent's banishment

We shall further think of it

If it be true all vengeance comes too short

Which can pursue th' offender How dost my lord

What did my father's godson seek your life

He whom my father named your Edgar

Was he not companion with the riotous knights

That tended upon my father

No marvel then though he were ill affected

'Tis they have put him on the old man's death

To have th' expense and waste of his revenues

I have this present evening from my sister

Been well informed of them and with such cautions

That if they come to sojourn at my house

I'll not be there

Thus out of season threading dark-eyed night

Occasions noble Gloucester of some poise

Wherein we must have use of your advice

Our father he hath writ so hath our sister

Of differences which I best thought it fit

To answer from our home The several messengers

From hence attend dispatch Our good old friend

Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow

Your needful counsel to our businesses

Which craves the instant use

The messengers from our sister and the King

Till noon Till night my lord and all night too

Sir being his knave I will

My sister may receive it much more worse

To have her gentleman abused assaulted

For following her affairsPut in his legs

I am glad to see your Highness

I pray you sir take patience I have hope

You less know how to value her desert

Than she to scant her duty

I cannot think my sister in the least

Would fail her obligation If sir perchance

She have restrained the riots of your followers

'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end

As clears her from all blame

O sir you are old

Nature in you stands on the very verge

Of his confine You should be ruled and led

By some discretion that discerns your state

Better than you yourself Therefore I pray you

That to our sister you do make return

Say you have wronged her

Good sir no more These are unsightly tricks

Return you to my sister

O the blest gods So will you wish on me

When the rash mood is on

Good sir to th' purpose

I know 'tmy sister's This approves her letter

That she would soon be here    Is your lady come

I pray you father being weak seem so

If till the expiration of your month

You will return and sojourn with my sister

Dismissing half your train come then to me

I am now from home and out of that provision

Which shall be needful for your entertainment

Not altogether so

I looked not for you yet nor am provided

For your fit welcome Give ear sir to my sister

For those that mingle reason with your passion

Must be content to think you old and so

But she knows what she does

I dare avouch it sir What fifty followers

Is it not well What should you need of more

Yea or so many sith that both charge and danger

Speak 'gainst so great a number How in one house

Should many people under two commands

Hold amity 'Tis hard almost impossible

Why not my lord If then they chanced to slack you

We could control them If you will come to me

For now I spy a danger I entreat you

To bring but five-and-twenty To no more

Will I give place or notice

And in good time you gave it

And speak 't again my lord No more with me

What need one

This house is little The old man and 's people

Cannot be well bestowed

For his particular I'll receive him gladly

But not one follower

O sir to willful men

The injuries that they themselves procure

Must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors

He is attended with a desperate train

And what they may incense him to being apt

To have his ear abused wisdom bids fear

Hang him instantly

Ingrateful fox 'Tis he

Hard hard O filthy traitor

So white and such a traitor

Be simple-answered for we know the truth

To whose hands

You have sent the lunatic king Speak

And false

Wherefore to Dover Wast thou not charged at peril

Wherefore to Dover

One side will mock another Th' other too

How now you dog

Give me thy sword A peasant stand up thus

Out treacherous villain

Thou call'st on him that hates thee It was he

That made the overture of thy treasons to us

Who is too good to pity thee

Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell

His way to Dover  How is 't my lord How look you

But are my brother's powers set forth

Himself in person there

Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home

What might import my sister's letter to him

Faith he is posted hence on serious matter

It was great ignorance Gloucester's eyes being out

To let him live Where he arrives he moves

All hearts against us Edmund I think is gone

In pity of his misery to dispatch

His nighted life moreover to descry

The strength o' th' enemy

Our troops set forth tomorrow Stay with us

The ways are dangerous

Why should she write to Edmund Might not you

Transport her purposes by word Belike

Some thingsI know not what I'll love thee much

Let me unseal the letter

I know your lady does not love her husband

I am sure of that and at her late being here

She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks

To noble Edmund I know you are of her bosom

I speak in understanding Y' are I know 't

Therefore I do advise you take this note

My lord is dead Edmund and I have talked

And more convenient is he for my hand

Than for your lady's You may gather more

If you do find him pray you give him this

And when your mistress hears thus much from you

I pray desire her call her wisdom to her

So fare you well

If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor

Preferment falls on him that cuts him off

Fare thee well

Our sister's man is certainly miscarried

Now sweet lord

You know the goodness I intend upon you

Tell me but truly but then speak the truth

Do you not love my sister

But have you never found my brother's way

To the forfended place

I am doubtful that you have been conjunct

And bosomed with her as far as we call hers

I never shall endure her Dear my lord

Be not familiar with her

Why is this reasoned

Sister you'll go with us

'Tis most convenient Pray go with us

That's as we list to grace him

Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded

Ere you had spoke so far He led our powers

Bore the commission of my place and person

The which immediacy may well stand up

And call itself your brother

In my rights

By me invested he compeers the best

Jesters do oft prove prophets

Lady I am not well else I should answer

From a full-flowing stomach General

Take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony

Dispose of them of me the walls is thine

Witness the world that I create thee here

My lord and master

Let the drum strike and prove my title thine

Sick O sick

My sickness grows upon me
