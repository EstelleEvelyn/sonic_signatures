Well, I have told you enough of this. For my

part, I’ll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will

have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.

Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the

bolting.

Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the

leavening.

Ay, to the leavening; but here’s yet in the word

hereafter the kneading, the making of the cake, the

heating the oven, and the baking. Nay, you must stay

the cooling too, or you may chance burn your lips.

Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever

I saw her look, or any woman else.

An her hair were not somewhat darker than

Helen’s—well, go to—there were no more comparison

between the women. But, for my part, she is

my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise

her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday,

as I did. I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra’s

wit, but—

I speak no more than truth.

Faith, I’ll not meddle in it. Let her be as she

is. If she be fair, ’tis the better for her; an she be

not, she has the mends in her own hands.

I have had my labor for my travail, ill thought

on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between

and between, but small thanks for my labor.

Because she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not

so fair as Helen; an she were not kin to me, she

would be as fair o’ Friday as Helen is on Sunday.

But what care I? I care not an she were a blackamoor;

’tis all one to me.

I do not care whether you do or no. She’s a

fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks,

and so I’ll tell her the next time I see her. For my

part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ th’ matter.

Not I.

Pray you speak no more to me. I will leave

all as I found it, and there an end.

What’s that? What’s that?

Good morrow, Cousin Cressid. What do you

talk of?— Good morrow, Alexander.—How do you,

cousin? When were you at Ilium?

What were you talking of when I came?

Was Hector armed and gone ere you came to

Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?

E’en so. Hector was stirring early.

Was he angry?

True, he was so. I know the cause too. He’ll

lay about him today, I can tell them that; and

there’s Troilus will not come far behind him. Let

them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.

Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of

the two.

What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do

you know a man if you see him?

Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.

No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.

Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were.

Condition I had gone barefoot to India.

Himself? No, he’s not himself. Would he

were himself! Well, the gods are above. Time must

friend or end. Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart

were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man

than Troilus.

He is elder.

Th’ other’s not come to ’t. You shall tell me

another tale when th’ other’s come to ’t. Hector

shall not have his wit this year.

Nor his qualities.

Nor his beauty.

You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself

swore th’ other day that Troilus, for a brown favor—

for so ’tis, I must confess—not brown neither—

Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.

She praised his complexion above Paris’.

So he has.

I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better

than Paris.

Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him

th’ other day into the compassed window—and

you know he has not past three or four hairs on his

chin—

Why, he is very young, and yet will he within

three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.

But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she

came and puts me her white hand to his cloven

chin—

Why, you know ’tis dimpled. I think his

smiling becomes him better than any man in all

Phrygia.

Does he not?

Why, go to, then. But to prove to you that

Helen loves Troilus—

Troilus? Why, he esteems her no more than

I esteem an addle egg.

I cannot choose but laugh to think how she

tickled his chin. Indeed, she has a marvellous

white hand, I must needs confess—

And she takes upon her to spy a white hair

on his chin.

But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba

laughed that her eyes ran o’er—

And Cassandra laughed—

And Hector laughed.

Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on

Troilus’ chin.

They laughed not so much at the hair as at

his pretty answer.

Quoth she “Here’s but two-and-fifty hairs

on your chin, and one of them is white.”

That’s true, make no question of that. “Two-and-fifty

hairs,” quoth he, “and one white. That

white hair is my father, and all the rest are his

sons.” “Jupiter!” quoth she, “which of these hairs

is Paris, my husband?” “The forked one,” quoth he.

“Pluck ’t out, and give it him.” But there was such

laughing, and Helen so blushed, and Paris so

chafed, and all the rest so laughed that it passed.

Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday.

Think on ’t.

I’ll be sworn ’tis true. He will weep you an

’twere a man born in April.

Hark, they are coming from the field. Shall

we stand up here and see them as they pass toward

Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.

Here, here, here’s an excellent place. Here

we may see most bravely. I’ll tell you them all by

their names as they pass by, but mark Troilus

above the rest.

That’s Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He’s

one of the flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark

Troilus; you shall see anon.

That’s Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can

tell you, and he’s a man good enough. He’s one o’

th’ soundest judgments in Troy whosoever; and a

proper man of person. When comes Troilus? I’ll

show you Troilus anon. If he see me, you shall see

him nod at me.

You shall see.

That’s Hector, that, that, look you, that.

There’s a fellow!—Go thy way, Hector!—There’s a

brave man, niece. O brave Hector! Look how he

looks. There’s a countenance! Is ’t not a brave man?

Is he not? It does a man’s heart good. Look

you what hacks are on his helmet. Look you yonder,

do you see? Look you there. There’s no jesting;

there’s laying on, take ’t off who will, as they say.

There be hacks.

Swords, anything, he cares not. An the devil

come to him, it’s all one. By God’s lid, it does one’s

heart good.

Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris! Look you

yonder, niece. Is ’t not a gallant man too? Is ’t not?

Why, this is brave now. Who said he came hurt

home today? He’s not hurt. Why, this will do

Helen’s heart good now, ha? Would I could see

Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.

That’s Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is.

That’s Helenus. I think he went not forth today.

That’s Helenus.

Helenus? No. Yes, he’ll fight indifferent

well. I marvel where Troilus is. Hark, do you not

hear the people cry “Troilus”? Helenus is a priest.

Where? Yonder? That’s Deiphobus. ’Tis

Troilus! There’s a man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus,

the prince of chivalry!

Mark him. Note him. O brave Troilus! Look

well upon him, niece. Look you how his sword is

bloodied and his helm more hacked than Hector’s,

and how he looks, and how he goes. O admirable

youth! He never saw three and twenty.—Go thy

way, Troilus; go thy way!—Had I a sister were a

Grace, or a daughter a goddess, he should take his

choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris is dirt to

him; and I warrant Helen, to change, would give

an eye to boot.

Asses, fools, dolts, chaff and bran, chaff and

bran, porridge after meat. I could live and die in

the eyes of Troilus. Ne’er look, ne’er look; the

eagles are gone. Crows and daws, crows and daws!

I had rather be such a man as Troilus than

Agamemnon and all Greece.

Achilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!

“Well, well”? Why, have you any discretion?

Have you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is

not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,

learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality and

such-like the spice and salt that season a man?

You are such a woman a man knows not at

what ward you lie.

Say one of your watches.

You are such another!

Where?

Good boy, tell him I come.

I doubt he be hurt.—Fare you well, good niece.

I will be with you, niece, by and by.

Ay, a token from Troilus.

Friend, you, pray you, a word. Do you not

follow the young Lord Paris?

You depend upon him, I mean.

You depend upon a notable gentleman. I

must needs praise him.

You know me, do you not?

Friend, know me better. I am the Lord

Pandarus.

I do desire it.

Grace? Not so, friend. “Honor” and “Lordship”

are my titles. What music is this?

Know you the musicians?

Who play they to?

At whose pleasure, friend?

Command, I mean, friend.

Friend, we understand not one another. I

am too courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose

request do these men play?

Who, my cousin Cressida?

It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not

seen the Lady Cressid. I come to speak with Paris

from the Prince Troilus. I will make a complimental

assault upon him, for my business seethes.

Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair

company! Fair desires in all fair measure fairly

guide them!—Especially to you, fair queen, fair

thoughts be your fair pillow!

You speak your fair pleasure, sweet

queen.—Fair prince, here is good broken music.

Truly, lady, no.

Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.

I have business to my lord, dear queen.—

My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?

Well, sweet queen, you are pleasant with

me.—But, marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and

most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus—

Go to, sweet queen, go to—commends himself

most affectionately to you—

Sweet queen, sweet queen, that’s a sweet

queen, i’ faith—

Nay, that shall not serve your turn, that

shall it not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such

words, no, no.—And, my lord, he desires you that

if the King call for him at supper, you will make his

excuse.

What says my sweet queen, my very, very

sweet queen?

What says my sweet queen? My cousin will

fall out with you.

No, no, no such matter; you are wide.

Come, your disposer is sick.

Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?

No, your poor disposer’s sick.

You spy? What do you spy?—Come, give me

an instrument.

Now, sweet queen.

My niece is horribly in love with a thing you

have, sweet queen.

He? No, she’ll none of him. They two are

twain.

Come, come, I’ll hear no more of this. I’ll

sing you a song now.

Ay, you may, you may.

Love? Ay, that it shall, i’ faith.

In good troth, it begins so.

Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!

For, O, love’s bow

Shoots buck and doe.

The shaft confounds

Not that it wounds

But tickles still the sore.

These lovers cry “O ho!” they die,

Yet that which seems the wound to kill

Doth turn “O ho!” to “Ha ha he!”

So dying love lives still.

“O ho!” awhile, but “Ha ha ha!”

“O ho!”groans out for “ha ha ha!”—Hey ho!

Is this the generation of love? Hot blood,

hot thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers.

Is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who’s

afield today?

Not I, honey sweet queen. I long to hear how

they sped today.—You’ll remember your brother’s

excuse?

Farewell, sweet queen.

I will, sweet queen.

How now? Where’s thy master? At my

cousin Cressida’s?

O, here he comes.—How now, how now?

Have you seen my cousin?

Walk here i’ th’ orchard. I’ll bring her

straight.

She’s making her ready; she’ll come straight.

You must be witty now. She does so blush and

fetches her wind so short as if she were frayed with

a spirit. I’ll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain. She

fetches her breath as short as a new-ta’en sparrow.

Come, come, what need you

blush? Shame’s a baby.—Here she is now. Swear

the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.

What, are you gone again?

You must be watched ere you be made tame, must

you? Come your ways; come your ways. An you

draw backward, we’ll put you i’ th’ thills.—Why

do you not speak to her?—Come, draw this curtain

and let’s see your picture.

Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight!

An ’twere dark, you’d close sooner.—So, so, rub on,

and kiss the mistress. How now? A

kiss in fee-farm? Build there, carpenter; the air is

sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I

part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks

i’ th’ river. Go to, go to.

Words pay no debts; give her deeds. But

she’ll bereave you o’ th’ deeds too, if she call your

activity in question. What, billing

again? Here’s “In witness whereof the parties

interchangeably—.” Come in, come in. I’ll go get a fire.

What, blushing still? Have you not done

talking yet?

I thank you for that. If my lord get a boy of

you, you’ll give him me. Be true to my lord. If he

flinch, chide me for it.

Nay, I’ll give my word for her too. Our kindred,

though they be long ere they be wooed, they

are constant being won. They are burrs, I can tell

you; they’ll stick where they are thrown.

Pretty, i’ faith!

Leave? An you take leave till tomorrow

morning—

Go to, a bargain made. Seal it, seal it. I’ll be

the witness. Here I hold your hand, here my

cousin’s. If ever you prove false one to another, since

I have taken such pains to bring you together, let

all pitiful goers-between be called to the world’s

end after my name: call them all panders. Let all

constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,

and all brokers-between panders. Say “Amen.”

Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber

with a bed, which bed, because it shall not

speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death.

Away.

And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here

Bed, chamber, pander to provide this gear.

What’s all the doors open here?

How now, how now? How go maidenheads?

Here, you maid! Where’s my Cousin Cressid?

To do what, to do what?—Let her say

what.—What have I brought you to do?

Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor capocchia!

Has ’t not slept tonight? Would he not—a

naughty man—let it sleep? A bugbear take him!

Who’s there? What’s the matter? Will you

beat down the door?

How now? What’s the matter?

Who’s there? My Lord Aeneas? By my troth,

I knew you not. What news with you so early?

Here? What should he do here?

Is he here, say you? It’s more than I know,

I’ll be sworn. For my own part, I came in late.

What should he do here?

Is ’t possible? No sooner got but lost? The

devil take Antenor! The young prince will go mad.

A plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke ’s

neck!

Ah, ah!

Would I were as deep under the earth as I

am above!

Pray thee, get thee in. Would thou hadst

ne’er been born! I knew thou wouldst be his death.

O, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!

Thou must be gone, wench; thou must be

gone. Thou art changed for Antenor. Thou must to

thy father and be gone from Troilus. ’Twill be his

death; ’twill be his bane. He cannot bear it.

Thou must.

Do, do.

Be moderate, be moderate.

Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet

ducks!

What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me

embrace too. “O heart,” as the goodly saying is,

O heart, heavy heart,

Why sigh’st thou without breaking?

where he answers again,

Because thou canst not ease thy smart

By friendship nor by speaking.

There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away

nothing, for we may live to have need of such a

verse. We see it, we see it. How now, lambs?

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ’tis too plain a case.

Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind,

or my heart will be blown up by the root.

Do you hear, my lord? Do you hear?

Here’s a letter come from yond poor girl.

A whoreson phthisic, a whoreson rascally

phthisic so troubles me, and the foolish fortune of

this girl, and what one thing, what another, that I

shall leave you one o’ these days. And I have a

rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my

bones that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell

what to think on ’t.—What says she there?

But hear you, hear you!

A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O

world, world, world! Thus is the poor agent despised.

O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are

you set a-work, and how ill requited! Why should

our endeavor be so loved and the performance so

loathed? What verse for it? What instance for it?

Let me see:

Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,

Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;

And being once subdued in armèd tail,

Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.

Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted

cloths:

As many as be here of panders’ hall,

Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar’s fall;

Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,

Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.

Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,

Some two months hence my will shall here be made.

It should be now, but that my fear is this:

Some gallèd goose of Winchester would hiss.

Till then I’ll sweat and seek about for eases,

And at that time bequeath you my diseases.
