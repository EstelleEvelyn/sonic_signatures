


Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old

sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and

sleeping upon benches after noon that thou hast

forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst

truly know What a devil hast thou to do with

the time of the day Unless hours were cups of

sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues

of bawds and dials the signs of leaping-houses

and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in

flame-colored taffeta I see no reason why thou

shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time

of the day

What none

Well how then Come roundly roundly

Thou sayest well and it holds well too for the

fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and

flow like the sea being governed as the sea is by

the moon As for proof now a purse of gold most

resolutely snatched on Monday night and most

dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning got with

swearing Lay by and spent with crying Bring

in now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder

and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the

gallows

As the honey of Hybla my old lad of the castle

And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of

durance

Why what a pox have I to do with my hostess

of the tavern

Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part

Yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would

stretch and where it would not I have used my

credit

No thou shalt

Thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt

have the hanging of the thieves and so become a

rare hangman

For obtaining of suits

Or an old lion or a lover's lute

What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy

of Moorditch

Thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the

streets and no man regards it

Where shall we take a purse tomorrow Jack

I see a good amendment of life in thee from

praying to purse-taking

Good morrow Ned

Sir John stands to his word The devil shall

have his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of

proverbs He will give the devil his due

Else he had been damned for cozening the

devil

Who I rob I a thief Not I by my faith

Well then once in my days I'll be a madcap

Well come what will I'll tarry at home

I care not

Farewell thou latter spring Farewell Allhallown

summer

How shall we part with them in setting forth

Yea but 'tis like that they will know us by our

horses by our habits and by every other appointment

to be ourselves

Yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us

Well I'll go with thee Provide us all things

necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap

There I'll sup Farewell

I know you all and will awhile uphold

The unyoked humor of your idleness

Yet herein will I imitate the sun

Who doth permit the base contagious clouds

To smother up his beauty from the world

That when he please again to be himself

Being wanted he may be more wondered at

By breaking through the foul and ugly mists

Of vapors that did seem to strangle him

If all the year were playing holidays

To sport would be as tedious as to work

But when they seldom come they wished-for come

And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents

So when this loose behavior I throw off

And pay the debt I never promisd

By how much better than my word I am

By so much shall I falsify men's hopes

And like bright metal on a sullen ground

My reformation glitt'ring o'er my fault

Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes

Than that which hath no foil to set it off

I'll so offend to make offense a skill

Redeeming time when men think least I will

Stand close

Peace you fat-kidneyed rascal What a brawling

dost thou keep

He is walked up to the top of the hill I'll go

seek him

Peace you fat guts Lie down lay thine ear

close to the ground and list if thou canst hear the

tread of travelers

Thou liest Thou art not colted thou art

uncolted

Out you rogue Shall I be your ostler

Sirs you four shall front them in the narrow

lane Ned Poins and I will walk lower If they 'scape

from your encounter then they light on us

What a coward Sir John Paunch

Well we leave that to the proof

Ned where are our disguises

The thieves have bound the true men Now

could thou and I rob the thieves and go merrily to

London it would be argument for a week laughter

for a month and a good jest forever

Your money

Got with much ease Now merrily to horse

The thieves are all scattered and possessed with fear

So strongly that they dare not meet each other

Each takes his fellow for an officer

Away good Ned Falstaff sweats to death

And lards the lean earth as he walks along

Were 't not for laughing I should pity him

Ned prithee come out of that fat room and

lend me thy hand to laugh a little

With three or four loggerheads amongst three

or fourscore hogsheads I have sounded the very

bass string of humility Sirrah I am sworn brother

to a leash of drawers and can call them all by their

Christian names as Tom Dick and Francis They

take it already upon their salvation that though I be

but Prince of Wales yet I am the king of courtesy

and tell me flatly I am no proud jack like Falstaff

but a Corinthian a lad of mettle a good boyby

the Lord so they call meand when I am king of

England I shall command all the good lads in

Eastcheap They call drinking deep dyeing scarlet

and when you breathe in your watering they

cry Hem and bid you Play it off To conclude I

am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour

that I can drink with any tinker in his own language

during my life I tell thee Ned thou hast lost much

honor that thou wert not with me in this action but

sweet Nedto sweeten which name of Ned I give

thee this pennyworth of sugar clapped even now

into my hand by an underskinker one that never

spake other English in his life than Eight shillings

and sixpence and You are welcome with this

shrill addition Anon anon sirScore a pint of

bastard in the Half-moon or so But Ned to

drive away the time till Falstaff come I prithee do

thou stand in some by-room while I question my

puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar and

do thou never leave calling Francis that his tale

to me may be nothing but Anon Step aside and

I'll show thee a precedent

Thou art perfect

Come hither Francis

How long hast thou to serve Francis

Five year By 'r Lady a long lease for the

clinking of pewter But Francis darest thou be

so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture

and show it a fair pair of heels and run

from it

How old art thou Francis

Nay but hark you Francis for the sugar thou

gavest me'twas a pennyworth was 't not

I will give thee for it a thousand pound Ask

me when thou wilt and thou shalt have it

Anon Francis No Francis But tomorrow

Francis or Francis o' Thursday or indeed Francis

when thou wilt But Francis

Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin crystal-button

not-pated agate-ring puke-stocking caddis-garter

smooth-tongue Spanish-pouch

Why then your brown bastard is your only

drink for look you Francis your white canvas

doublet will sully In Barbary sir it cannot come to

so much

Away you rogue Dost thou not hear them

call

Let them alone awhile and then open the

door Poins

Sirrah Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are

at the door Shall we be merry

I am now of all humors that have showed

themselves humors since the old days of Goodman

Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve

o'clock at midnight

What's o'clock Francis

That ever this fellow should have fewer words

than a parrot and yet the son of a woman His

industry is upstairs and downstairs his eloquence

the parcel of a reckoning I am not yet of Percy's

mind the Hotspur of the north he that kills me

some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast

washes his hands and says to his wife Fie upon

this quiet life I want work O my sweet Harry

says she how many hast thou killed today

Give my roan horse a drench says he and answers

Some fourteen an hour after A trifle a

trifle I prithee call in Falstaff I'll play Percy

and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer

his wife Rivo says the drunkard Call in

Ribs call in Tallow

Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of

butterpitiful-hearted Titanthat melted at the

sweet tale of the sun's If thou didst then behold

that compound

How now woolsack what mutter you

Why you whoreson round man what's the

matter

O villain thy lips are scarce wiped since thou

drunk'st last

What's the matter

Where is it Jack where is it

What a hundred man

Speak sirs how was it

What fought you with them all

Pray God you have not murdered some of

them

What four Thou said'st but two even now

Seven Why there were but four even now

Prithee let him alone We shall have

more anon

Ay and mark thee too Jack

So two more already

O monstrous Eleven buckram men grown out

of two

These lies are like their father that begets

them gross as a mountain open palpable Why

thou claybrained guts thou knotty-pated fool thou

whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch

Why how couldst thou know these men in

Kendal green when it was so dark thou couldst not

see thy hand Come tell us your reason What sayest

thou to this

I'll be no longer guilty of this sin This sanguine

coward this bed-presser this horse-backbreaker

this huge hill of flesh

Well breathe awhile and then to it again and

when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons

hear me speak but this

We two saw you four set on four and bound

them and were masters of their wealth Mark now

how a plain tale shall put you down Then did we

two set on you four and with a word outfaced you

from your prize and have it yea and can show it

you here in the house And Falstaff you carried

your guts away as nimbly with as quick dexterity

and roared for mercy and still run and roared as

ever I heard bull-calf What a slave art thou to hack

thy sword as thou hast done and then say it was in

fight What trick what device what starting-hole

canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open

and apparent shame

Content and the argument shall be thy running

away

How now my lady the hostess what sayst thou

to me

Give him as much as will make him a royal

man and send him back again to my mother

Prithee do Jack

Now sirs By 'r Lady you fought

fairSo did you PetoSo did you Bardolph

You are lions too You ran away upon instinct You

will not touch the true prince No fie

Faith tell me now in earnest how came Falstaff's

sword so hacked

O villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen

years ago and wert taken with the manner and ever

since thou hast blushed extempore Thou hadst fire

and sword on thy side and yet thou ran'st away

What instinct hadst thou for it

I do

Hot livers and cold purses

No If rightly taken halter

Here comes lean Jack Here comes bare-bone

How now my sweet creature of bombast How long

is 't ago Jack since thou sawest thine own knee

He that rides at high speed and with his pistol

kills a sparrow flying

So did he never the sparrow

Why what a rascal art thou then to praise him

so for running

Yes Jack upon instinct

Why then it is like if there come a hot June

and this civil buffeting hold we shall buy maidenheads

as they buy hobnails by the hundreds

Not a whit i' faith I lack some of thy instinct

Do thou stand for my father and examine me

upon the particulars of my life

Thy state is taken for a joined stool thy golden

scepter for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich

crown for a pitiful bald crown

Well here is my leg

What manner of man an it like your Majesty

Dost thou speak like a king Do thou stand for

me and I'll play my father

Well here I am set

Now Harry whence come you

The complaints I hear of thee are

grievous

Swearest thou Ungracious boy

henceforth ne'er look on me Thou art violently

carried away from grace There is a devil haunts

thee in the likeness of an old fat man A tun of man

is thy companion Why dost thou converse with that

trunk of humors that bolting-hutch of beastliness

that swollen parcel of dropsies that huge bombard

of sack that stuffed cloakbag of guts that roasted

Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly that

reverend Vice that gray iniquity that father ruffian

that vanity in years Wherein is he good but to taste

sack and drink it Wherein neat and cleanly but to

carve a capon and eat it Wherein cunning but in

craft Wherein crafty but in villainy Wherein villainous

but in all things Wherein worthy but in

nothing

That villainous abominable misleader

of youth Falstaff that old white-bearded Satan

I know thou dost

I do I will

Heigh heigh the devil rides upon a fiddlestick

What's the matter

And thou a natural coward without instinct

Go hide thee behind the arras The

rest walk up aboveNow my masters for a true

face and good conscience

Call in the Sheriff

Now Master Sheriff what is your will with me

What men

The man I do assure you is not here

For I myself at this time have employed him

And sheriff I will engage my word to thee

That I will by tomorrow dinner time

Send him to answer thee or any man

For anything he shall be charged withal

And so let me entreat you leave the house

It may be so If he have robbed these men

He shall be answerable and so farewell

I think it is good morrow is it not

This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's Go

call him forth

Hark how hard he fetches breath Search his

pockets

What hast thou found

Let's see what they be Read them

O monstrous But one halfpennyworth of

bread to this intolerable deal of sack What there is

else keep close We'll read it at more advantage

There let him sleep till day I'll to the court in the

morning We must all to the wars and thy place

shall be honorable I'll procure this fat rogue a

charge of foot and I know his death will be a march

of twelve score The money shall be paid back again

with advantage Be with me betimes in the morning

and so good morrow Peto

So please your Majesty I would I could

Quit all offenses with as clear excuse

As well as I am doubtless I can purge

Myself of many I am charged withal

Yet such extenuation let me beg

As in reproof of many tales devised

Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear

By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers

I may for some things true wherein my youth

Hath faulty wandered and irregular

Find pardon on my true submission

I shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord

Be more myself

Do not think so You shall not find it so

And God forgive them that so much have swayed

Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me

I will redeem all this on Percy's head

And in the closing of some glorious day

Be bold to tell you that I am your son

When I will wear a garment all of blood

And stain my favors in a bloody mask

Which washed away shall scour my shame with it

And that shall be the day whene'er it lights

That this same child of honor and renown

This gallant Hotspur this all-praisd knight

And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet

For every honor sitting on his helm

Would they were multitudes and on my head

My shames redoubled For the time will come

That I shall make this northern youth exchange

His glorious deeds for my indignities

Percy is but my factor good my lord

To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf

And I will call him to so strict account

That he shall render every glory up

Yea even the slightest worship of his time

Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart

This in the name of God I promise here

The which if He be pleased I shall perform

I do beseech your Majesty may salve

The long-grown wounds of my intemperance

If not the end of life cancels all bands

And I will die a hundred thousand deaths

Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow

What say'st thou Mistress Quickly How doth

thy husband I love him well he is an honest man

What say'st thou Jack

What didst thou lose Jack

A trifle some eightpenny matter

What he did not

An otter Sir John Why an otter

Thou sayst true hostess and he slanders thee

most grossly

Sirrah do I owe you a thousand pound

I say 'tis copper Darest thou be as good as thy

word now

And why not as the lion

O if it should how would thy guts fall about

thy knees But sirrah there's no room for faith

truth nor honesty in this bosom of thine It is all

filled up with guts and midriff Charge an honest

woman with picking thy pocket Why thou whoreson

impudent embossed rascal if there were

anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings

memorandums of bawdy houses and one poor

pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long-winded

if thy pocket were enriched with any other

injuries but these I am a villain And yet you will

stand to it You will not pocket up wrong Art thou

not ashamed

It appears so by the story

O my sweet beef I must still be good angel to

thee The money is paid back again

I am good friends with my father and may do

anything

I have procured thee Jack a charge of foot

Bardolph

Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster

To my brother John this to my Lord of Westmoreland

Go Peto to horse to horse for thou and I

Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time

Jack meet me tomorrow in the Temple hall

At two o'clock in the afternoon

There shalt thou know thy charge and there receive

Money and order for their furniture

The land is burning Percy stands on high

And either we or they must lower lie

How now blown Jack How now quilt

I think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath

already made thee butter But tell me Jack whose

fellows are these that come after

I did never see such pitiful rascals

No I'll be sworn unless you call three fingers

in the ribs bare But sirrah make haste Percy is

already in the field

The southern wind

Doth play the trumpet to his purposes

And by his hollow whistling in the leaves

Foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day

Peace chewet peace

In both your armies there is many a soul

Shall pay full dearly for this encounter

If once they join in trial Tell your nephew

The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world

In praise of Henry Percy By my hopes

This present enterprise set off his head

I do not think a braver gentleman

More active-valiant or more valiant-young

More daring or more bold is now alive

To grace this latter age with noble deeds

For my part I may speak it to my shame

I have a truant been to chivalry

And so I hear he doth account me too

Yet this before my father's majesty

I am content that he shall take the odds

Of his great name and estimation

And will to save the blood on either side

Try fortune with him in a single fight

It will not be accepted on my life

The Douglas and the Hotspur both together

Are confident against the world in arms

Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship

Say thy prayers and farewell

Why thou owest God a death

What stand'st thou idle here Lend me thy sword

Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff

Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies

Whose deaths are yet unrevenged I prithee

Lend me thy sword

He is indeed and living to kill thee

I prithee lend me thy sword

Give it me What is it in the case

What is it a time to jest and dally now

I beseech your Majesty make up

Lest your retirement do amaze your friends

Lead me my lord I do not need your help

And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive

The Prince of Wales from such a field as this

Where stained nobility lies trodden on

And rebels' arms triumph in massacres

By God thou hast deceived me Lancaster

I did not think thee lord of such a spirit

Before I loved thee as a brother John

But now I do respect thee as my soul

O this boy lends mettle to us all

Hold up thy head vile Scot or thou art like

Never to hold it up again The spirits

Of valiant Shirley Stafford Blunt are in my arms

It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee

Who never promiseth but he means to pay

Cheerly my lord How fares your Grace

Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent

And so hath Clifton I'll to Clifton straight

O God they did me too much injury

That ever said I hearkened for your death

If it were so I might have let alone

The insulting hand of Douglas over you

Which would have been as speedy in your end

As all the poisonous potions in the world

And saved the treacherous labor of your son

Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name

Why then I see

A very valiant rebel of the name

I am the Prince of Wales and think not Percy

To share with me in glory any more

Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere

Nor can one England brook a double reign

Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales

I'll make it greater ere I part from thee

And all the budding honors on thy crest

I'll crop to make a garland for my head

For worms brave Percy Fare thee well great heart

Ill-weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk

When that this body did contain a spirit

A kingdom for it was too small a bound

But now two paces of the vilest earth

Is room enough This earth that bears thee dead

Bears not alive so stout a gentleman

If thou wert sensible of courtesy

I should not make so dear a show of zeal

But let my favors hide thy mangled face

And even in thy behalf I'll thank myself

For doing these fair rites of tenderness

Adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven

Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave

But not remembered in thy epitaph

What old acquaintance could not all this flesh

Keep in a little life Poor Jack farewell

I could have better spared a better man

O I should have a heavy miss of thee

If I were much in love with vanity

Death hath not struck so fat a deer today

Though many dearer in this bloody fray

Emboweled will I see thee by and by

Till then in blood by noble Percy lie

Come brother John Full bravely hast thou fleshed

Thy maiden sword

I did I saw him dead

Breathless and bleeding on the groundArt thou alive

Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight

I prithee speak We will not trust our eyes

Without our ears Thou art not what thou seem'st

Why Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead

This is the strangest fellow brother John

Come bring your luggage nobly on your back

For my part if a lie may do thee grace

I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have

The trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours

Come brother let us to the highest of the field

To see what friends are living who are dead

The noble Scot Lord Douglas when he saw

The fortune of the day quite turned from him

The noble Percy slain and all his men

Upon the foot of fear fled with the rest

And falling from a hill he was so bruised

That the pursuers took him At my tent

The Douglas is and I beseech your Grace

I may dispose of him

Then brother John of Lancaster to you

This honorable bounty shall belong

Go to the Douglas and deliver him

Up to his pleasure ransomless and free

His valors shown upon our crests today

Have taught us how to cherish such high deeds

Even in the bosom of our adversaries
