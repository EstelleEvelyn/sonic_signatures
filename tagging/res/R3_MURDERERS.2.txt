
We will my noble lord

I would speak with Clarence and I

came hither on my legs

What shall I stab him as he

sleeps

Why he shall never wake until the

great Judgment Day

The urging of that word judgment

hath bred a kind of remorse in me

Not to kill him having a warrant

but to be damned for killing him from the which

no warrant can defend me

So I amto let him live

Nay I prithee stay a little I hope

this passionate humor of mine will change It was

wont to hold me but while one tells twenty

Faith some certain dregs of conscience

are yet within me

Zounds he dies I had forgot the

reward

O in the Duke of Gloucester's

purse

'Tis no matter Let it go There's

few or none will entertain it

I'll not meddle with it It makes a

man a coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth

him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man

cannot lie with his neighbor's wife but it detects

him 'Tis a blushing shamefaced spirit that mutinies

in a man's bosom It fills a man full of

obstacles It made me once restore a purse of gold

that by chance I found It beggars any man that

keeps it It is turned out of towns and cities for a

dangerous thing and every man that means to live

well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it

Take the devil in thy mind and

believe him not He would insinuate with thee but

to make thee sigh

Spoke like a tall man that respects

thy reputation Come shall we fall to work

O excellent deviceand make a

sop of him

Strike

You shall have wine enough my lord anon

To to to

Ay ay

Never my lord Therefore prepare to die

And he that hath commanded is our king

And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee

For false forswearing and for murder too

Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight

In quarrel of the House of Lancaster

Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend

You are deceived Your brother Gloucester hates you

Make peace with God for you must die my lord

What shall we do

Look behind you my lord

A bloody deed and desperately dispatched

How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands

Of this most grievous murder

I would he knew that I had saved his brother

Take thou the fee and tell him what I say

For I repent me that the Duke is slain
