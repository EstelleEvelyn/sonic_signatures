


They want their porridge and their fat bull beeves

Either they must be dieted like mules

And have their provender tied to their mouths

Or piteous they will look like drownd mice

Froissart a countryman of ours records

England all Olivers and Rolands bred

During the time Edward the Third did reign

More truly now may this be verified

For none but Samsons and Goliases

It sendeth forth to skirmish One to ten

Lean rawboned rascals Who would e'er suppose

They had such courage and audacity

Be it so

Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock

Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech

He may mean more than we poor men do know

These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues

Leave off delays and let us raise the siege

All France will be replete with mirth and joy

When they shall hear how we have played the men

How now my lords What all unready so

Of all exploits since first I followed arms

Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise

More venturous or desperate than this

Here cometh Charles I marvel how he sped

Had all your quarters been as safely kept

As that whereof I had the government

We had not been thus shamefully surprised

Seigneur no

We'll set thy statue in some holy place

And have thee reverenced like a blessd saint

Employ thee then sweet virgin for our good

Forever should they be expulsed from France

And not have title of an earldom here

Pucelle hath bravely played her part in this

And doth deserve a coronet of gold

Then march to Paris royal Charles of France

And keep not back your powers in dalliance

Must he be then as shadow of himself

Adorn his temples with a coronet

And yet in substance and authority

Retain but privilege of a private man

This proffer is absurd and reasonless

To say the truth it is your policy

To save your subjects from such massacre

And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen

By our proceeding in hostility

And therefore take this compact of a truce

Although you break it when your pleasure serves
