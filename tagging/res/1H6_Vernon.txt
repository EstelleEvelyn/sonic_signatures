


Stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more

Till you conclude that he upon whose side

The fewest roses are croppd from the tree

Shall yield the other in the right opinion

Then for the truth and plainness of the case

I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here

Giving my verdict on the white rose side

If I my lord for my opinion bleed

Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt

And keep me on the side where still I am

In your behalf still will I wear the same

Now sir to you that were so hot at sea

Disgracing of these colors that I wear

In honor of my noble Lord of York

Dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st

Sirrah thy lord I honor as he is

Hark you not so in witness take you that

Well miscreant I'll be there as soon as you

And after meet you sooner than you would

Grant me the combat gracious sovereign

With him my lord for he hath done me wrong

And that is my petition noble lord

For though he seem with forgd quaint conceit

To set a gloss upon his bold intent

Yet know my lord I was provoked by him

And he first took exceptions at this badge

Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower

Bewrayed the faintness of my master's heart

Nay let it rest where it began at first
