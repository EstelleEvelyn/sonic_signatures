


I pray you sir is it your will

To make a stale of me amongst these mates

I' faith sir you shall never need to fear

Iwis it is not halfway to her heart

But if it were doubt not her care should be

To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool

And paint your face and use you like a fool

A pretty peat It is best

Put finger in the eye an she knew why

Why and I trust I may go too may I not

What shall I be appointed hours as though belike

I knew not what to take and what to leave Ha

Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell

Whom thou lov'st best See thou dissemble not

Minion thou liest Is 't not Hortensio

O then belike you fancy riches more

You will have Gremio to keep you fair

If that be jest then all the rest was so

Her silence flouts me and I'll be revenged

What will you not suffer me Nay now I see

She is your treasure she must have a husband

I must dance barefoot on her wedding day

And for your love to her lead apes in hell

Talk not to me I will go sit and weep

Till I can find occasion of revenge

Well have you heard but something hard of hearing

They call me Katherine that do talk of me

Moved in good time Let him that moved you hither

Remove you hence I knew you at the first

You were a movable

A joint stool

Asses are made to bear and so are you

No such jade as you if me you mean

Too light for such a swain as you to catch

And yet as heavy as my weight should be

Well ta'en and like a buzzard

Ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard

If I be waspish best beware my sting

Ay if the fool could find it where it lies

In his tongue

Yours if you talk of tales and so farewell

That I'll try

So may you lose your arms

If you strike me you are no gentleman

And if no gentleman why then no arms

What is your crest A coxcomb

No cock of mine You crow too like a craven

It is my fashion when I see a crab

There is there is

Had I a glass I would

Well aimed of such a young one

Yet you are withered

I care not

I chafe you if I tarry Let me go

Go fool and whom thou keep'st command

Where did you study all this goodly speech

A witty mother witless else her son

Yes keep you warm

Call you me daughter Now I promise you

You have showed a tender fatherly regard

To wish me wed to one half lunatic

A madcap ruffian and a swearing Jack

That thinks with oaths to face the matter out

I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first

No shame but mine I must forsooth be forced

To give my hand opposed against my heart

Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen

Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure

I told you I he was a frantic fool

Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior

And to be noted for a merry man

He'll woo a thousand 'point the day of marriage

Make friends invite and proclaim the banns

Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed

Now must the world point at poor Katherine

And say Lo there is mad Petruchio's wife

If it would please him come and marry her

Would Katherine had never seen him though

Let me entreat you

Are you content to stay

Now if you love me stay

Nay then

Do what thou canst I will not go today

No nor tomorrow not till I please myself

The door is open sir There lies your way

You may be jogging whiles your boots are green

For me I'll not be gone till I please myself

'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom

That take it on you at the first so roundly

I will be angry What hast thou to do

Father be quiet He shall stay my leisure

Gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner

I see a woman may be made a fool

If she had not a spirit to resist

Patience I pray you 'twas a fault unwilling

I pray you husband be not so disquiet

The meat was well if you were so contented

The more my wrong the more his spite appears

What did he marry me to famish me

Beggars that come unto my father's door

Upon entreaty have a present alms

If not elsewhere they meet with charity

But I who never knew how to entreat

Nor never needed that I should entreat

Am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep

With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed

And that which spites me more than all these wants

He does it under name of perfect love

As who should say if I should sleep or eat

'Twere deadly sickness or else present death

I prithee go and get me some repast

I care not what so it be wholesome food

'Tis passing good I prithee let me have it

I like it well Good Grumio fetch it me

A dish that I do love to feed upon

Why then the beef and let the mustard rest

Then both or one or any thing thou wilt

Go get thee gone thou false deluding slave

That feed'st me with the very name of meat

Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you

That triumph thus upon my misery

Go get thee gone I say

Faith as cold as can be

I pray you let it stand

I thank you sir

I'll have no bigger This doth fit the time

And gentlewomen wear such caps as these

Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak

And speak I will I am no child no babe

Your betters have endured me say my mind

And if you cannot best you stop your ears

My tongue will tell the anger of my heart

Or else my heart concealing it will break

And rather than it shall I will be free

Even to the uttermost as I please in words

Love me or love me not I like the cap

And it I will have or I will have none

I never saw a better-fashioned gown

More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable

Belike you mean to make a puppet of me

I dare assure you sir 'tis almost two

And 'twill be supper time ere you come there

The moon The sun It is not moonlight now

I know it is the sun that shines so bright

Forward I pray since we have come so far

And be it moon or sun or what you please

And if you please to call it a rush candle

Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me

I know it is the moon

Then God be blest it is the blessd sun

But sun it is not when you say it is not

And the moon changes even as your mind

What you will have it named even that it is

And so it shall be so for Katherine

Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet

Whither away or where is thy abode

Happy the parents of so fair a child

Happier the man whom favorable stars

Allots thee for his lovely bedfellow

Pardon old father my mistaking eyes

That have been so bedazzled with the sun

That everything I look on seemeth green

Now I perceive thou art a reverend father

Pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking

Husband let's follow to see the end of

this ado

What in the midst of the street

No sir God forbid but ashamed to kiss

Nay I will give thee a kiss Now pray thee love stay

Mistress how mean you that

He that is giddy thinks the world turns round

I pray you tell me what you meant by that

A very mean meaning

And I am mean indeed respecting you

What is your will sir that you send for me

They sit conferring by the parlor fire

Fie fie Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow

And dart not scornful glances from those eyes

To wound thy lord thy king thy governor

It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads

Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds

And in no sense is meet or amiable

A woman moved is like a fountain troubled

Muddy ill-seeming thick bereft of beauty

And while it is so none so dry or thirsty

Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it

Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper

Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee

And for thy maintenance commits his body

To painful labor both by sea and land

To watch the night in storms the day in cold

Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe

And craves no other tribute at thy hands

But love fair looks and true obedience

Too little payment for so great a debt

Such duty as the subject owes the prince

Even such a woman oweth to her husband

And when she is froward peevish sullen sour

And not obedient to his honest will

What is she but a foul contending rebel

And graceless traitor to her loving lord

I am ashamed that women are so simple

To offer war where they should kneel for peace

Or seek for rule supremacy and sway

When they are bound to serve love and obey

Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth

Unapt to toil and trouble in the world

But that our soft conditions and our hearts

Should well agree with our external parts

Come come you froward and unable worms

My mind hath been as big as one of yours

My heart as great my reason haply more

To bandy word for word and frown for frown

But now I see our lances are but straws

Our strength as weak our weakness past compare

That seeming to be most which we indeed least are

Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot

And place your hands below your husband's foot

In token of which duty if he please

My hand is ready may it do him ease
