


How does your Grace

Yes madam but I think your Grace

Out of the pain you suffered gave no ear to 't

Well the voice goes madam

For after the stout Earl Northumberland

Arrested him at York and brought him forward

As a man sorely tainted to his answer

He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill

He could not sit his mule

At last with easy roads he came to Leicester

Lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot

With all his convent honorably received him

To whom he gave these words O Father Abbot

An old man broken with the storms of state

Is come to lay his weary bones among you

Give him a little earth for charity

So went to bed where eagerly his sickness

Pursued him still and three nights after this

About the hour of eight which he himself

Foretold should be his last full of repentance

Continual meditations tears and sorrows

He gave his honors to the world again

His blessd part to heaven and slept in peace

Noble madam

Men's evil manners live in brass their virtues

We write in water May it please your Highness

To hear me speak his good now

This cardinal

Though from an humble stock undoubtedly

Was fashioned to much honor From his cradle

He was a scholar and a ripe and good one

Exceeding wise fair-spoken and persuading

Lofty and sour to them that loved him not

But to those men that sought him sweet as summer

And though he were unsatisfied in getting

Which was a sin yet in bestowing madam

He was most princely Ever witness for him

Those twins of learning that he raised in you

Ipswich and Oxford one of which fell with him

Unwilling to outlive the good that did it

The other though unfinished yet so famous

So excellent in art and still so rising

That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue

His overthrow heaped happiness upon him

For then and not till then he felt himself

And found the blessedness of being little

And to add greater honors to his age

Than man could give him he died fearing God

She is asleep Good wench let's sit down quiet

For fear we wake her Softly gentle Patience

Madam we are here

None madam

I am most joyful madam such good dreams

Possess your fancy

She is going wench Pray pray

You are to blame

Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness

To use so rude behavior Go to Kneel
