That did disrobe the lion of that robe.

My uncle’s will in this respect is mine.

If he see aught in you that makes him like,

That anything he sees which moves his liking

I can with ease translate it to my will.

Or if you will, to speak more properly,

I will enforce it eas’ly to my love.

Further I will not flatter you, my lord,

That all I see in you is worthy love,

Than this: that nothing do I see in you,

Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,

That I can find should merit any hate.

That she is bound in honor still to do

What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.

That’s the curse of Rome.

The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,

But from her need.

Upon thy wedding day?

Against the blood that thou hast marrièd?

What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?

Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,

Clamors of hell, be measures to our pomp?

O husband, hear me! Ay, alack, how new

Is “husband” in my mouth! Even for that name,

Which till this time my tongue did ne’er pronounce,

Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms

Against mine uncle.

Now shall I see thy love. What motive may

Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

The sun’s o’ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu.

Which is the side that I must go withal?

I am with both, each army hath a hand,

And in their rage, I having hold of both,

They whirl asunder and dismember me.

Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win.—

Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose.—

Father, I may not wish the fortune thine.—

Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive.

Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose.

Assurèd loss before the match be played.

There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
