


My loving lord Dumaine is mortified

The grosser manner of these world's delights

He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves

To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die

With all these living in philosophy

Proceeded well to stop all good proceeding

How follows that

In reason nothing

Sir I pray you a word What lady is that same

A gallant lady monsieur Fare you well

O most divine Kate

By heaven the wonder in a mortal eye

Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted

As upright as the cedar

As fair as day

O that I had my wish

I would forget her but a fever she

Reigns in my blood and will remembered be

Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ

On a dayalack the day

Love whose month is ever May

Spied a blossom passing fair

Playing in the wanton air

Through the velvet leaves the wind

All unseen can passage find

That the lover sick to death

Wished himself the heaven's breath

Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow

Air would I might triumph so

But alack my hand is sworn

Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn

Vow alack for youth unmeet

Youth so apt to pluck a sweet

Do not call it sin in me

That I am forsworn for thee

Thou for whom Jove would swear

Juno but an Ethiope were

And deny himself for Jove

Turning mortal for thy love

This will I send and something else more plain

That shall express my true love's fasting pain

O would the King Berowne and Longaville

Were lovers too Ill to example ill

Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note

For none offend where all alike do dote

It is Berowne's writing and here is his name

Now the number is even

To look like her are chimney-sweepers black

Dark needs no candles now for dark is light

I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear

O vile Then as she goes what upward lies

The street should see as she walked overhead

Ay marry there some flattery for this evil

Some salve for perjury

Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word

Fair lady

Please it you

As much in private and I'll bid adieu

Let us confess and turn it to a jest

The Great

A Judas

Judas Maccabaeus clipped is plain Judas

The more shame for you Judas

The head of a bodkin

The carved-bone face on a flask

Ay and in a brooch of lead

For the latter end of his name

Though my mocks come home by me I will

now be merry

More calf certain

He's a god or a painter for he makes faces

A gilt nutmeg

No cloven

That mint

Ay and Hector's a greyhound

He may not by the yard

Most rare Pompey

Hector trembles

Hector will challenge him

Room for the incensed Worthies

Most resolute Pompey

You may not deny it Pompey hath made the

challenge

Our letters madam showed much more than jest

But what to me my love But what to me

A wife

O shall I say I thank you gentle wife

I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then

The worthy knight of Troy
