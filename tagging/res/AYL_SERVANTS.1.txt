Well met honest gentleman

Shall we clap into 't roundly without

hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse which

are the only prologues to a bad voice

It was a lover and his lass

With a hey and a ho and a hey-nonny-no

That o'er the green cornfield did pass

In springtime the only pretty ring time

When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding

Sweet lovers love the spring

Between the acres of the rye

With a hey and a ho and a hey-nonny-no

These pretty country folks would lie

In springtime the only pretty ring time

When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding

Sweet lovers love the spring

This carol they began that hour

With a hey and a ho and a hey-nonny-no

How that a life was but a flower

In springtime the only pretty ring time

When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding

Sweet lovers love the spring

And therefore take the present time

With a hey and a ho and a hey-nonny-no

For love is crownd with the prime

In springtime the only pretty ring time

When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding

Sweet lovers love the spring

You are deceived sir We kept time We lost

not our time
