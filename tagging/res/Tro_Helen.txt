


Dear lord you are full of fair words

He is full of harmony

O sir

Nay this shall not hedge us out We'll hear you

sing certainly

My Lord Pandarus honey-sweet lord

You shall not bob us out of our melody If you

do our melancholy upon your head

And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence

My Lord Pandarus

Nay but my lord

You must not know where he sups

Why this is kindly done

She shall have it my lord if it be not my Lord

Paris

Falling in after falling out may make them

three

Ay ay prithee Now by my troth sweet lord

thou hast a fine forehead

Let thy song be love This love will undo us all

O Cupid Cupid Cupid

In love i' faith to the very tip of the nose

He hangs the lip at somethingYou know all

Lord Pandarus

Commend me to your niece

'Twill make us proud to be his servant Paris

Yea what he shall receive of us in duty

Gives us more palm in beauty than we have

Yea overshines ourself
