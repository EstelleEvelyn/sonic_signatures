Signior Leonato?

Is she not a modest young lady?

No, I pray thee, speak in sober judgment.

Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell

me truly how thou lik’st her.

Can the world buy such a jewel?

In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever

I looked on.

I would scarce trust myself, though I had

sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.

If this were so, so were it uttered.

If my passion change not shortly, God forbid

it should be otherwise.

You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

That I love her, I feel.

And never could maintain his part but in the

force of his will.

If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be

horn-mad.

To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had

it—

My liege, your Highness now may do me good.

Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

O, my lord,

When you went onward on this ended action,

I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye,

That liked, but had a rougher task in hand

Than to drive liking to the name of love.

But now I am returned and that war thoughts

Have left their places vacant, in their rooms

Come thronging soft and delicate desires,

All prompting me how fair young Hero is,

Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.

How sweetly you do minister to love,

That know love’s grief by his complexion!

But lest my liking might too sudden seem,

I would have salved it with a longer treatise.

You know me well. I am he.

How know you he loves her?

Thus answer I in name of Benedick,

But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.

’Tis certain so. The Prince woos for himself.

Friendship is constant in all other things

Save in the office and affairs of love.

Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.

Let every eye negotiate for itself

And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch

Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.

This is an accident of hourly proof,

Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore, Hero.

Yea, the same.

Whither?

I wish him joy of her.

I pray you, leave me.

If it will not be, I’ll leave you.

Not sad, my lord.

Neither, my lord.

Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were

but little happy if I could say how much.—Lady, as

you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you

and dote upon the exchange.

And so she doth, cousin.

Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches

till love have all his rites.

And I, my lord.

Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,

As hushed on purpose to grace harmony!

O, very well my lord. The music ended,

We’ll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.

O, ay. Stalk on, stalk on; the

fowl sits.—I did never think that lady would have

loved any man.

Faith, like enough.

Bait the hook well; this fish

will bite.

She did indeed.

He hath ta’en th’ infection.

Hold it up.

’Tis true indeed, so your daughter says. “Shall

I,” says she, “that have so oft encountered him with

scorn, write to him that I love him?”

Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember

a pretty jest your daughter told us of.

That.

Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps,

sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses:

“O sweet Benedick, God give me patience!”

To what end? He would make but a sport of it

and torment the poor lady worse.

And she is exceeding wise.

Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says

she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere

she make her love known, and she will die if he woo

her rather than she will bate one breath of her

accustomed crossness.

He is a very proper man.

Before God, and in my mind, very wise.

And I take him to be valiant.

Never tell him, my lord, let her wear it out

with good counsel.

If he do not

dote on her upon this, I will never trust my

expectation.

I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe

me.

I hope he be in love.

You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.

Yet say I, he is in love.

If he be not in love with some woman, there

is no believing old signs. He brushes his hat o’

mornings. What should that bode?

No, but the barber’s man hath been seen

with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath

already stuffed tennis balls.

That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in

love.

And when was he wont to wash his face?

Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept

into a lute string and now governed by stops—

Nay, but I know who loves him.

Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of

all, dies for him.

’Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this

played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two

bears will not bite one another when they meet.

If there be any impediment, I pray you discover

it.

Who, Hero?

Disloyal?

May this be so?

If I see anything tonight why I should not

marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I

should wed, there will I shame her.

O mischief strangely thwarting!

No.

Know you any, Hero?

O, what men dare do! What men may do!

What men daily do, not knowing what they do!

Stand thee by, friar.—Father, by your leave,

Will you with free and unconstrainèd soul

Give me this maid, your daughter?

And what have I to give you back whose worth

May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.—

There, Leonato, take her back again.

Give not this rotten orange to your friend.

She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.

Behold how like a maid she blushes here!

O, what authority and show of truth

Can cunning sin cover itself withal!

Comes not that blood as modest evidence

To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,

All you that see her, that she were a maid,

By these exterior shows? But she is none.

She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.

Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

Not to be married,

Not to knit my soul to an approvèd wanton.

I know what you would say: if I have known her,

You will say she did embrace me as a husband,

And so extenuate the forehand sin.

No, Leonato,

I never tempted her with word too large,

But, as a brother to his sister, showed

Bashful sincerity and comely love.

Out on thee, seeming! I will write against it.

You seem to me as Dian in her orb,

As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown.

But you are more intemperate in your blood

Than Venus, or those pampered animals

That rage in savage sensuality.

Leonato, stand I here?

Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother?

Is this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own?

Let me but move one question to your daughter,

And by that fatherly and kindly power

That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

To make you answer truly to your name.

Marry, that can Hero!

Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.

What man was he talked with you yesternight

Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?

Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been

If half thy outward graces had been placed

About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!

But fare thee well, most foul, most fair. Farewell,

Thou pure impiety and impious purity.

For thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love

And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,

To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,

And never shall it more be gracious.

Good day to both of you.

Who wrongs him?

Marry, beshrew my hand

If it should give your age such cause of fear.

In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

My villainy?

Away! I will not have to do with you.

Now, signior, what news?

We had like to have had our two noses

snapped off with two old men without teeth.

We have been up and down to seek thee, for

we are high-proof melancholy and would fain have

it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?

Never any did so, though very many have

been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do

the minstrels: draw to pleasure us.

What, courage, man! What

though care killed a cat? Thou hast mettle enough

in thee to kill care.

Nay, then, give him another staff.

This last was broke ’cross.

If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.

God bless me from a challenge!

Well, I will meet you, so I may have good

cheer.

I’ faith, I thank him. He hath bid me to a

calf’s head and a capon, the which if I do not carve

most curiously, say my knife’s naught. Shall I not

find a woodcock too?

For the which she wept heartily and said she

cared not.

All, all. And, moreover, God saw him when

he was hid in the garden.

Yea, and text underneath: “Here dwells Benedick,

the married man”?

In most profound earnest, and, I’ll warrant

you, for the love of Beatrice.

Most sincerely.

He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape

a doctor to such a man.

Hearken after their offense, my lord.

Rightly reasoned, and in his own division;

and, by my troth, there’s one meaning well suited.

I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.

Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear

In the rare semblance that I loved it first.

I know not how to pray your patience,

Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself.

Impose me to what penance your invention

Can lay upon my sin. Yet sinned I not

But in mistaking.

O, noble sir!

Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.

I do embrace your offer and dispose

For henceforth of poor Claudio.

Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.

Is this the monument of Leonato?

Done to death by slanderous tongues

Was the Hero that here lies.

Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,

Gives her fame which never dies.

So the life that died with shame

Lives in death with glorious fame.

Hang thou there upon the tomb,

Praising her when I am dumb.

Now music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.

Now, unto thy bones, goodnight.

Yearly will I do this rite.

Good morrow, masters. Each his several way.

And Hymen now with luckier issue speed ’s,

Than this for whom we rendered up this woe.

I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.

I think he thinks upon the savage bull.

Tush, fear not, man. We’ll tip thy horns with gold,

And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,

As once Europa did at lusty Jove

When he would play the noble beast in love.

For this I owe you. Here comes other reck’nings.

Which is the lady I must seize upon?

Why, then, she’s mine.—Sweet, let me see your face.

Give me your hand before this holy friar.

I am your husband, if you like of me.

Another Hero!

And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her,

For here’s a paper written in his hand,

A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,

Fashioned to Beatrice.

I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied

Beatrice, that I might have cudgeled thee out of thy

single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out

of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look

exceeding narrowly to thee.
