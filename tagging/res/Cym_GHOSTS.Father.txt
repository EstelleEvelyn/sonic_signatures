Thy spite on mortal flies.

With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,

That thy adulteries

Rates and revenges.

Hath my poor boy done aught but well,

Whose face I never saw?

I died whilst in the womb he stayed,

Attending nature’s law;

Whose father then—as men report

Thou orphans’ father art—

Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him

From this earth-vexing smart.

Great Nature, like his ancestry,

Molded the stuff so fair

That he deserved the praise o’ th’ world

As great Sicilius’ heir.

Why did you suffer Iachimo,

Slight thing of Italy,

To taint his nobler heart and brain

With needless jealousy,

And to become the geck and scorn

O’ th’ other’s villainy?

Thy crystal window ope; look out.

No longer exercise

Upon a valiant race thy harsh

And potent injuries.

Peep through thy marble mansion. Help,

Or we poor ghosts will cry

To th’ shining synod of the rest

Against thy deity.

He came in thunder. His celestial breath

Was sulphurous to smell. The holy eagle

Stooped as to foot us. His ascension is

More sweet than our blest fields; his royal bird

Preens the immortal wing and cloys his beak,

As when his god is pleased.

Thanks, Jupiter.

The marble pavement closes; he is entered

His radiant roof. Away, and, to be blest,

Let us with care perform his great behest.
