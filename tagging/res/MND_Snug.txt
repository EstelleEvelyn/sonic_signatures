be give it me for I am slow of study

That would hang us every mother's son

Masters the Duke is coming from the temple

and there is two or three lords and ladies more

married If our sport had gone forward we had all

been made men

You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear

The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor

May now perchance both quake and tremble here

When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar

Then know that I as Snug the joiner am

A lion fell nor else no lion's dam

For if I should as lion come in strife

Into this place 'twere pity on my life

O
