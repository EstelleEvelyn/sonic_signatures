That they of Rome are entered in our counsels

And know how we proceed.

Our army’s in the field.

We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready

To answer us.

The gods assist you!

Farewell.

Farewell.

No, nor a man that fears you less than he:

That’s lesser than a little. Hark, our drums

Are bringing forth our youth. We’ll break our walls

Rather than they shall pound us up. Our gates,

Which yet seem shut, we have but pinned with rushes.

They’ll open of themselves. Hark you, far off!

There is Aufidius. List what work he makes

Amongst your cloven army.
