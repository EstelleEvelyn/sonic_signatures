Thersites

Dog

Thou bitchwolf's son canst thou not hear Feel

then

Speak then thou unsalted leaven speak I will

beat thee into handsomeness

Toadstool learn me the proclamation

The proclamation

Do not porpentine do not My fingers itch

I say the proclamation

Mistress Thersites

Cobloaf

You whoreson cur

Thou stool for a witch

You dog

You cur

Therefore I beat thee

O thou damned cur I shall

I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the

proclamation and he rails upon me

Well go to go to

I shall cut out your tongue

Farewell Who shall answer him

O meaning you I will go learn more of it

Yes lion-sick sick of proud heart You may call

it melancholy if you will favor the man but by my

head 'tis pride But why why Let him show us a

causeA word my lord

What is he more than another

Is he so much Do you not think he thinks himself

a better man than I am

Will you subscribe his thought and say he is

Why should a man be proud How doth pride

grow I know not what pride is

I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering

of toads

If I go to him with my armd fist

I'll pash him o'er the face

An he be proud with me I'll feeze his pride

Let me go to him

A paltry insolent fellow

Can he not be sociable

I'll let his humorous blood

An all men were of my mind

he should not bear it so he should eat swords

first Shall pride carry it

I will knead him I'll make him supple

A whoreson dog that shall palter with us thus

Would he were a Trojan

Shall I call you father

How now Patroclus

Ha

Ay and good next day too

Thou trumpet there's my purse

Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe

Blow villain till thy spherd bias cheek

Outswell the colic of puffed Aquilon

Come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood

Thou blowest for Hector

The Trojan's trumpet

I am not warm yet Let us fight again

I thank thee Hector

Thou art too gentle and too free a man

I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence

A great addition earnd in thy death

If I might in entreaties find success

As seld I have the chance I would desire

My famous cousin to our Grecian tents

Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here

Do not chafe thee cousin

And you Achilles let these threats alone

Till accident or purpose bring you to 't

You may have every day enough of Hector

If you have stomach The general state I fear

Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him

No yonder'tis there where we see the lights

No not a whit

Troilus thou coward Troilus

Troilus thou coward Troilus show thy head

What wouldst thou

Were I the General thou shouldst have my office

Ere that correctionTroilus I say What Troilus

I'll fight with him alone Stand Diomed

If it be so yet bragless let it be

Great Hector was as good a man as he
