Thomas Horner for saying that the Duke of York

was rightful heir to the crown

That my master was No forsooth My master

said that he was and that the King was an

usurper

By these ten bones my lords he did speak

them to me in the garret one night as we were

scouring my lord of York's armor

Alas my lord I cannot fight for God's sake pity

my case The spite of man prevaileth against me O

Lord have mercy upon me I shall never be able to

fight a blow O Lord my heart

I thank you all Drink and pray for me I pray

you for I think I have taken my last draft in this

world Here Robin an if I die I give thee my

apronAnd Will thou shalt have my hammer

And here Tom take all the money that I have

O Lord bless me I

pray God for I am never able to deal with my

master He hath learnt so much fence already

Peter forsooth

Thump

O God have I overcome mine enemies in this

presence O Peter thou hast prevailed in right
