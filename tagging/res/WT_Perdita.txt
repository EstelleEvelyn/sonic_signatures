
Sir my gracious lord

To chide at your extremes it not becomes me

O pardon that I name them Your high self

The gracious mark o' th' land you have obscured

With a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid

Most goddesslike pranked up But that our feasts

In every mess have folly and the feeders

Digest it with a custom I should blush

To see you so attired swoon I think

To show myself a glass

Now Jove afford you cause

To me the difference forges dread Your greatness

Hath not been used to fear Even now I tremble

To think your father by some accident

Should pass this way as you did O the Fates

How would he look to see his work so noble

Vilely bound up What would he say Or how

Should I in these my borrowed flaunts behold

The sternness of his presence

O but sir

Your resolution cannot hold when 'tis

Opposed as it must be by th' power of the King

One of these two must be necessities

Which then will speak that you must change this purpose

Or I my life

O Lady Fortune

Stand you auspicious

Sir welcome

It is my father's will I should take on me

The hostess-ship o' th' day You're welcome sir

Give me those flowers there DorcasReverend sirs

For you there's rosemary and rue These keep

Seeming and savor all the winter long

Grace and remembrance be to you both

And welcome to our shearing

Sir the year growing ancient

Not yet on summer's death nor on the birth

Of trembling winter the fairest flowers o' th' season

Are our carnations and streaked gillyvors

Which some call nature's bastards Of that kind

Our rustic garden's barren and I care not

To get slips of them

For I have heard it said

There is an art which in their piedness shares

With great creating nature

So it is

I'll not put

The dibble in earth to set one slip of them

No more than were I painted I would wish

This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore

Desire to breed by me Here's flowers for you

Hot lavender mints savory marjoram

The marigold that goes to bed wi' th' sun

And with him rises weeping These are flowers

Of middle summer and I think they are given

To men of middle age You're very welcome

Out alas

You'd be so lean that blasts of January

Would blow you through and throughNow my fair'st friend

I would I had some flowers o' th' spring that might

Become your time of day and yours and yours

That wear upon your virgin branches yet

Your maidenheads growing O Proserpina

For the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall

From Dis's wagon Daffodils

That come before the swallow dares and take

The winds of March with beauty violets dim

But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes

Or Cytherea's breath pale primroses

That die unmarried ere they can behold

Bright Phoebus in his strengtha malady

Most incident to maids bold oxlips and

The crown imperial lilies of all kinds

The flower-de-luce being oneO these I lack

To make you garlands of and my sweet friend

To strew him o'er and o'er

No like a bank for love to lie and play on

Not like a corse or if not to be buried

But quick and in mine arms Come take your flowers

Methinks I play as I have seen them do

In Whitsun pastorals Sure this robe of mine

Does change my disposition

O Doricles

Your praises are too large But that your youth

And the true blood which peeps fairly through 't

Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd

With wisdom I might fear my Doricles

You wooed me the false way

I'll swear for 'em

Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words

in 's tunes

Ay good brother or go about to think

I cannot speak

So well nothing so well no nor mean better

By th' pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out

The purity of his

Even here undone

I was not much afeard for once or twice

I was about to speak and tell him plainly

The selfsame sun that shines upon his court

Hides not his visage from our cottage but

Looks on alike Will 't please you sir be gone

I told you what would come of this Beseech you

Of your own state take care This dream of mine

Being now awake I'll queen it no inch farther

But milk my ewes and weep

How often have I told you 'twould be thus

How often said my dignity would last

But till 'twere known

One of these is true

I think affliction may subdue the cheek

But not take in the mind

Your pardon sir For this

I'll blush you thanks

Happy be you

All that you speak shows fair

I see the play so lies

That I must bear a part

O my poor father

The heaven sets spies upon us will not have

Our contract celebrated

And give me leave

And do not say 'tis superstition that

I kneel and then implore her blessing Lady

Dear queen that ended when I but began

Give me that hand of yours to kiss

So long could I

Stand by a looker-on
