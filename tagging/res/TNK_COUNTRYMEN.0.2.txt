Clap her aboard tomorrow night

and stow her, and all’s made up again.

And Sennois and Rycas; and

three better lads ne’er danced under green tree.

And you know what wenches, ha! But will the

dainty domine, the Schoolmaster, keep touch, do

you think? For he does all, you know.

All the boys in Athens blow wind

i’ th’ breech on ’s. And here I’ll be and there I’ll be,

for our town, and here again, and there again. Ha,

boys, hey for the weavers!

By any means; our thing of learning

says so—where he himself will edify the Duke

most parlously in our behalfs. He’s excellent i’ th’

woods; bring him to th’ plains, his learning makes

no cry.

Where were you bred, you know it not?

Wrestling and running.—’Tis a pretty fellow.

I’ll be

plum porridge! He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come,

let’s be gone, lads.

Draw up the company. Where’s

the taborer?

And little Luce with the white

legs, and bouncing Barbary.

This is that scornful piece, that

scurvy hilding that gave her promise faithfully she

would be here—Cicely, the sempster’s daughter.

The next gloves that I give her shall be dogskin;

nay, an she fail me once—you can tell, Arcas, she

swore by wine and bread she would not break.

Come, lass, let’s trip it.
