


Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain He

was then of a crescent note expected to prove so

worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of

But I could then have looked on him without the

help of admiration though the catalogue of his

endowments had been tabled by his side and I to

peruse him by items

This matter of marrying his king's daughter

wherein he must be weighed rather by her value

than his own words him I doubt not a great deal

from the matter

Ay and the approbation of those that weep

this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully

to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment

which else an easy battery might lay flat for

taking a beggar without less qualityBut how

comes it he is to sojourn with you How creeps

acquaintance

Can we with manners ask what was the

difference

That lady is not now living or this gentleman's

opinion by this worn out

You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of

Italy

As fair and as gooda kind of hand-in-hand

comparisonhad been something too fair and too

good for any lady in Britain If she went before

others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlusters

many I have beheld I could not but

believe she excelled many But I have not seen the

most precious diamond that is nor you the lady

What do you esteem it at

Either your unparagoned mistress is dead or

she's outprized by a trifle

Which the gods have given you

You may wear her in title yours but you

know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds

Your ring may be stolen too So your brace of unprizable

estimations the one is but frail and the

other casual A cunning thief or a that-way-accomplished

courtier would hazard the winning both of

first and last

With five times so much conversation I

should get ground of your fair mistress make her

go back even to the yielding had I admittance and

opportunity to friend

I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my

estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues

it something But I make my wager rather against

your confidence than her reputation and to bar

your offense herein too I durst attempt it against

any lady in the world

What's that

Would I had put my estate and my neighbor's

on th' approbation of what I have spoke

Yours whom in constancy you think stands

so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your

ring that commend me to the court where your

lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity

of a second conference and I will bring from

thence that honor of hers which you imagine so

reserved

You are a friend and therein the wiser If you

buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot

preserve it from tainting But I see you have some

religion in you that you fear

I am the master of my speeches and would

undergo what's spoken I swear

By the gods it is oneIf I bring you no sufficient

testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest

bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand

ducats are yours so is your diamond too If I come

off and leave her in such honor as you have trust

in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are

yours provided I have your commendation for my

more free entertainment

Your hand a covenant

We will have these things set down by lawful counsel

and straight away for Britain lest the bargain

should catch cold and starve I will fetch my gold

and have our two wagers recorded

Change you madam

The worthy Leonatus is in safety

And greets your Highness dearly

All of her that is out of door most rich

If she be furnished with a mind so rare

She is alone th' Arabian bird and I

Have lost the wager Boldness be my friend

Arm me audacity from head to foot

Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight

Rather directly fly

Thanks fairest lady

What are men mad Hath nature given them eyes

To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop

Of sea and land which can distinguish 'twixt

The fiery orbs above and the twinned stones

Upon the numbered beach and can we not

Partition make with spectacles so precious

'Twixt fair and foul

It cannot be i' th' eye for apes and monkeys

'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and

Contemn with mows the other nor i' th' judgment

For idiots in this case of favor would

Be wisely definite nor i' th' appetite

Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed

Should make desire vomit emptiness

Not so allured to feed

The cloyd will

That satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub

Both filled and running ravening first the lamb

Longs after for the garbage

Thanks madam well

Beseech you sir

Desire my man's abode where I did leave him

He's strange and peevish

Well madam

Exceeding pleasant None a stranger there

So merry and so gamesome He is called

The Briton Reveler

I never saw him sad

There is a Frenchman his companion one

An eminent monsieur that it seems much loves

A Gallian girl at home He furnaces

The thick sighs from him whiles the jolly Briton

Your lord I meanlaughs from 's free lungs cries O

Can my sides hold to think that man who knows

By history report or his own proof

What woman is yea what she cannot choose

But must be will 's free hours languish for

Assurd bondage

Ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter

It is a recreation to be by

And hear him mock the Frenchman But heavens know

Some men are much to blame

Not hebut yet heaven's bounty towards him might

Be used more thankfully In himself 'tis much

In you which I account his beyond all talents

Whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound

To pity too

Two creatures heartily

Lamentable What

To hide me from the radiant sun and solace

I' th' dungeon by a snuff

That others do

I was about to say enjoy yourbut

It is an office of the gods to venge it

Not mine to speak on 't

Had I this cheek

To bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch

Whose every touch would force the feeler's soul

To th' oath of loyalty this object which

Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye

Fixing it only here should I damned then

Slaver with lips as common as the stairs

That mount the Capitol join gripes with hands

Made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as

With labor then by-peeping in an eye

Base and illustrous as the smoky light

That's fed with stinking tallow it were fit

That all the plagues of hell should at one time

Encounter such revolt

And himself Not I

Inclined to this intelligence pronounce

The beggary of his change but 'tis your graces

That from my mutest conscience to my tongue

Charms this report out

O dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart

With pity that doth make me sick A lady

So fair and fastened to an empery

Would make the great'st king double to be partnered

With tomboys hired with that self exhibition

Which your own coffers yield with diseased ventures

That play with all infirmities for gold

Which rottenness can lend nature such boiled stuff

As well might poison poison Be revenged

Or she that bore you was no queen and you

Recoil from your great stock

Should he make me

Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets

Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps

In your despite upon your purse Revenge it

I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure

More noble than that runagate to your bed

And will continue fast to your affection

Still close as sure

Let me my service tender on your lips

O happy Leonatus I may say

The credit that thy lady hath of thee

Deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness

Her assured creditBlessd live you long

A lady to the worthiest sir that ever

Country called his and you his mistress only

For the most worthiest fit Give me your pardon

I have spoke this to know if your affiance

Were deeply rooted and shall make your lord

That which he is new o'er and he is one

The truest mannered such a holy witch

That he enchants societies into him

Half all men's hearts are his

He sits 'mongst men like a descended god

He hath a kind of honor sets him off

More than a mortal seeming Be not angry

Most mighty princess that I have adventured

To try your taking of a false report which hath

Honored with confirmation your great judgment

In the election of a sir so rare

Which you know cannot err The love I bear him

Made me to fan you thus but the gods made you

Unlike all others chaffless Pray your pardon

My humble thanks I had almost forgot

T' entreat your Grace but in a small request

And yet of moment too for it concerns

Your lord myself and other noble friends

Are partners in the business

Some dozen Romans of us and your lord

The best feather of our winghave mingled sums

To buy a present for the Emperor

Which I the factor for the rest have done

In France 'Tis plate of rare device and jewels

Of rich and exquisite form their values great

And I am something curious being strange

To have them in safe stowage May it please you

To take them in protection

They are in a trunk

Attended by my men I will make bold

To send them to you only for this night

I must aboard tomorrow

Yes I beseech or I shall short my word

By length'ning my return From Gallia

I crossed the seas on purpose and on promise

To see your Grace

O I must madam

Therefore I shall beseech you if you please

To greet your lord with writing do 't tonight

I have outstood my time which is material

To th' tender of our present

The crickets sing and man's o'erlabored sense

Repairs itself by rest Our Tarquin thus

Did softly press the rushes ere he wakened

The chastity he woundedCytherea

How bravely thou becom'st thy bed fresh lily

And whiter than the sheetsThat I might touch

But kiss one kiss Rubies unparagoned

How dearly they do 't 'Tis her breathing that

Perfumes the chamber thus The flame o' th' taper

Bows toward her and would underpeep her lids

To see th' enclosd lights now canopied

Under these windows white and azure-laced

With blue of heaven's own tinct But my design

To note the chamber I will write all down

Such and such pictures there the window such

Th' adornment of her bed the arras figures

Why such and such and the contents o' th' story

Ah but some natural notes about her body

Above ten thousand meaner movables

Would testify t' enrich mine inventory

O sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her

And be her sense but as a monument

Thus in a chapel lyingCome off come off

As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard

'Tis mine and this will witness outwardly

As strongly as the conscience does within

To th' madding of her lord On her left breast

A mole cinque-spotted like the crimson drops

I' th' bottom of a cowslip Here's a voucher

Stronger than ever law could make This secret

Will force him think I have picked the lock and ta'en

The treasure of her honor No more To what end

Why should I write this down that's riveted

Screwed to my memory She hath been reading late

The tale of Tereus here the leaf's turned down

Where Philomel gave up I have enough

To th' trunk again and shut the spring of it

Swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning

May bare the raven's eye I lodge in fear

Though this a heavenly angel hell is here

One two three Time time

Your lady

Is one of the fairest that I have looked upon

Here are letters for you

'Tis very like

He was expected then but not approached

If I have lost it

I should have lost the worth of it in gold

I'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy

A second night of such sweet shortness which

Was mine in Britain for the ring is won

Not a whit

Your lady being so easy

Good sir we must

If you keep covenant Had I not brought

The knowledge of your mistress home I grant

We were to question farther but I now

Profess myself the winner of her honor

Together with your ring and not the wronger

Of her or you having proceeded but

By both your wills

Sir my circumstances

Being so near the truth as I will make them

Must first induce you to believe whose strength

I will confirm with oath which I doubt not

You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find

You need it not

First her bedchamber

Where I confess I slept not but profess

Had that was well worth watchingit was hanged

With tapestry of silk and silver the story

Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman

And Cydnus swelled above the banks or for

The press of boats or pride A piece of work

So bravely done so rich that it did strive

In workmanship and value which I wondered

Could be so rarely and exactly wrought

Since the true life on 't was

More particulars

Must justify my knowledge

The chimney

Is south the chamber and the chimney-piece

Chaste Dian bathing Never saw I figures

So likely to report themselves the cutter

Was as another Nature dumb outwent her

Motion and breath left out

The roof o' th' chamber

With golden cherubins is fretted Her andirons

I had forgot themwere two winking Cupids

Of silver each on one foot standing nicely

Depending on their brands

Then if you can

Be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel See

And now 'tis up again It must be married

To that your diamond I'll keep them

Sir I thank her that

She stripped it from her arm I see her yet

Her pretty action did outsell her gift

And yet enriched it too She gave it me

And said she prized it once

She writes so to you doth she

By Jupiter I had it from her arm

If you seek

For further satisfying under her breast

Worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud

Of that most delicate lodging By my life

I kissed it and it gave me present hunger

To feed again though full You do remember

This stain upon her

Will you hear more

I'll be sworn

I'll deny nothing

With all my heart

The heaviness and guilt within my bosom

Takes off my manhood I have belied a lady

The Princess of this country and the air on 't

Revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl

A very drudge of nature's have subdued me

In my profession Knighthoods and honors borne

As I wear mine are titles but of scorn

If that thy gentry Britain go before

This lout as he exceeds our lords the odds

Is that we scarce are men and you are gods

'Tis their fresh supplies

Thou 'lt torture me to leave unspoken that

Which to be spoke would torture thee

I am glad to be constrained to utter that

Which torments me to conceal By villainy

I got this ring 'Twas Leonatus' jewel

Whom thou didst banish andwhich more may grieve thee

As it doth mea nobler sir ne'er lived

'Twixt sky and ground Wilt thou hear more my lord

That paragon thy daughter

For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits

Quail to rememberGive me leave I faint

Upon a timeunhappy was the clock

That struck the hourit was in Romeaccursed

The mansion where'twas at a feastO would

Our viands had been poisoned or at least

Those which I heaved to headthe good Posthumus

What should I say He was too good to be

Where ill men were and was the best of all

Amongst the rar'st of good onessitting sadly

Hearing us praise our loves of Italy

For beauty that made barren the swelled boast

Of him that best could speak for feature laming

The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva

Postures beyond brief nature for condition

A shop of all the qualities that man

Loves woman for besides that hook of wiving

Fairness which strikes the eye

All too soon I shall

Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly This Posthumus

Most like a noble lord in love and one

That had a royal lover took his hint

And not dispraising whom we praisedtherein

He was as calm as virtuehe began

His mistress' picture which by his tongue being made

And then a mind put in 't either our brags

Were cracked of kitchen trulls or his description

Proved us unspeaking sots

Your daughter's chastitythere it begins

He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams

And she alone were cold whereat I wretch

Made scruple of his praise and wagered with him

Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore

Upon his honored finger to attain

In suit the place of 's bed and win this ring

By hers and mine adultery He true knight

No lesser of her honor confident

Than I did truly find her stakes this ring

And would so had it been a carbuncle

Of Phoebus' wheel and might so safely had it

Been all the worth of 's car Away to Britain

Post I in this design Well may you sir

Remember me at court where I was taught

Of your chaste daughter the wide difference

'Twixt amorous and villainous Being thus quenched

Of hope not longing mine Italian brain

Gan in your duller Britain operate

Most vilely for my vantage excellent

And to be brief my practice so prevailed

That I returned with simular proof enough

To make the noble Leonatus mad

By wounding his belief in her renown

With tokens thus and thus averring notes

Of chamber-hanging pictures this her bracelet

O cunning how I got itnay some marks

Of secret on her person that he could not

But think her bond of chastity quite cracked

I having ta'en the forfeit Whereupon

Methinks I see him now

I am down again

But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee

As then your force did Take that life beseech you

Which I so often owe but your ring first

And here the bracelet of the truest princess

That ever swore her faith
