than now he is with that which makes him

both without and within.

His father and I were soldiers together, to

whom I have been often bound for no less than my

life.

Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained

amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your knowing,

to a stranger of his quality.—I beseech you all,

be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend

to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy

he is I will leave to appear hereafter rather

than story him in his own hearing.

Let us leave here, gentlemen.

Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too

suddenly. Let it die as it was born, and, I pray you,

be better acquainted.

I will have it no lay.

Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray, let us

follow ’em.

What means do you make to him?

Your very goodness and your company

O’erpays all I can do. By this, your king

Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius

Will do ’s commission throughly. And I think

He’ll grant the tribute, send th’ arrearages,

Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance

Is yet fresh in their grief.

See, Iachimo!

Welcome, sir.

Was Caius Lucius in the Briton court

When you were there?

Have patience, sir,

And take your ring again. ’Tis not yet won.

It may be probable she lost it; or

Who knows if one her women, being corrupted,

Hath stol’n it from her.

Sir, be patient.

This is not strong enough to be believed

Of one persuaded well of.

Quite beside

The government of patience. You have won.

Let’s follow him and pervert the present wrath

He hath against himself.
