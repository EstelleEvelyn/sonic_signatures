
Ay and I think

One business does command us all

For mine is money

And sir Philotus' too

Welcome good brother

What do you think the hour

So much

Not yet

Ay but the days are waxed shorter with him

You must consider that a prodigal course

Is like the sun's

But not like his recoverable I fear

'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse

That is one may reach deep enough and yet

Find little

Mark how strange it shows

Timon in this should pay more than he owes

And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels

And send for money for 'em

Five thousand mine

Flaminius Sir a word Pray is my lord

ready to come forth

Ha Is not that his steward muffled so

He goes away in a cloud Call him call him

Ay but this answer will not serve

Many do keep their chambers are not sick

And if it be so far beyond his health

Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts

And make a clear way to the gods

Put in now Titus

Here's mine

Alas my lord

Five thousand crowns my lord
