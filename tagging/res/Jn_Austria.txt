


Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss

As seal to this indenture of my love

That to my home I will no more return

Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France

Together with that pale that white-faced shore

Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides

And coops from other lands her islanders

Even till that England hedged in with the main

That water-walld bulwark still secure

And confident from foreign purposes

Even till that utmost corner of the West

Salute thee for her king Till then fair boy

Will I not think of home but follow arms

The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords

In such a just and charitable war

By how much unexpected by so much

We must awake endeavor for defense

For courage mounteth with occasion

Let them be welcome then We are prepared

Peace

What the devil art thou

What cracker is this same that deafs our ears

With this abundance of superfluous breath

Peace No more

I from the north

And your lips too for I am well assured

That I did so when I was first assured

Lady Constance peace

O that a man should speak those words to me

Thou dar'st not say so villain for thy life

King Philip listen to the Cardinal

Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs

Because

Do so King Philip Hang no more in doubt

Rebellion flat rebellion
