be good people in a commonweal that do nothing

but use their abuses in common houses, I know no

law. Bring them away.

If it please your Honor, I am the poor duke’s

constable, and my name is Elbow. I do lean upon

justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good

Honor two notorious benefactors.

If it please your Honor, I know not well what

they are, but precise villains they are, that I am sure

of, and void of all profanation in the world that

good Christians ought to have.

He, sir? A tapster, sir, parcel bawd; one that

serves a bad woman, whose house, sir, was, as they

say, plucked down in the suburbs, and now she

professes a hothouse, which I think is a very ill

house too.

My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and

your Honor—

Ay, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest

woman—

I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she,

that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity

of her life, for it is a naughty house.

Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a

woman cardinally given, might have been accused

in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness

there.

Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as

she spit in his face, so she defied him.

Prove it before these varlets here, thou honorable

man, prove it.

I beseech you, sir, ask him what

this man did to my wife.

First, an it like you, the house is a respected

house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his

mistress is a respected woman.

Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The

time is yet to come that she was ever respected with

man, woman, or child.

O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O

thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with her before I

was married to her?—If ever I was respected with

her, or she with me, let not your Worship think me

the poor duke’s officer.—Prove this, thou wicked

Hannibal, or I’ll have mine action of batt’ry on thee.

Marry, I thank your good Worship for it. What

is ’t your Worship’s pleasure I shall do with this

wicked caitiff?

Marry, I thank your Worship for it.

Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what’s

come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou

varlet, thou art to continue.

Seven year and a half, sir.

And a half, sir.

Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As

they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for

them. I do it for some piece of money and go

through with all.

To your Worship’s house, sir?

Nay, if there be no remedy for it

but that you will needs buy and sell men and

women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink

brown and white bastard.

Come your way, sir.—Bless you, good father

friar.

Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir,

we take him to be a thief too, sir, for we have found

upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have

sent to the Deputy.

He must before the Deputy, sir; he has given

him warning. The Deputy cannot abide a whoremaster.

If he be a whoremonger and comes before

him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.

His neck will come to your waist—a cord, sir.

For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

Come your ways, sir, come.

Come your ways, sir, come.
