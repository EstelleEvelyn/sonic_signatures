Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.

I want more uncles here to welcome me.

God keep me from false friends, but they were none.

I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.—

I thought my mother and my brother York

Would long ere this have met us on the way.

Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not

To tell us whether they will come or no!

Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?

Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.

Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,

Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

I do not like the Tower, of any place.—

Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

Is it upon record, or else reported

Successively from age to age, he built it?

But say, my lord, it were not registered,

Methinks the truth should live from age to age,

As ’twere retailed to all posterity,

Even to the general all-ending day.

What say you, uncle?

That Julius Caesar was a famous man.

With what his valor did enrich his wit,

His wit set down to make his valor live.

Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,

For now he lives in fame, though not in life.

I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham—

An if I live until I be a man,

I’ll win our ancient right in France again

Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?

Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.

Too late he died that might have kept that title,

Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

A beggar, brother?

My lord of York will still be cross in talk.

Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.

My Lord Protector needs will have it so.

I fear no uncles dead.

An if they live, I hope I need not fear.

But come, my lord. With a heavy heart,

Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.

Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower.

Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,

And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death.

Thy nephews’ souls bid thee despair and die.

Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace and wake in joy.

Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy.

Live, and beget a happy race of kings.

Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
