for they can write and read

I know that Deformed He

has been a vile thief this seven year He goes up and

down like a gentleman I remember his name

We charge you in the Prince's name

stand

And one Deformed is one of them I

know him he wears a lock

You'll be made bring

Deformed forth I warrant you

This man said sir that Don John the

Prince's brother was a villain

And that Count Claudio did mean

upon his words to disgrace Hero before the whole

assembly and not marry her
