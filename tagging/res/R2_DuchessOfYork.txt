


My lord you told me you would tell the rest

When weeping made you break the story off

Of our two cousins coming into London

At that sad stop my lord

Where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops

Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head

Alack poor Richard Where rode he the whilst

Here comes my son Aumerle

Welcome my son Who are the violets now

That strew the green lap of the new-come spring

What should you fear

'Tis nothing but some bond that he is entered into

For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day

What is the matter my lord

Why what is it my lord

What is the matter

I will not peaceWhat is the matter Aumerle

Thy life answer

Strike him Aumerle Poor boy thou art amazed

Hence villain never more come in my sight

Why York what wilt thou do

Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own

Have we more sons Or are we like to have

Is not my teeming date drunk up with time

And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age

And rob me of a happy mother's name

Is he not like thee Is he not thine own

He shall be none We'll keep him here

Then what is that to him

Hadst thou groaned for him as I have done

Thou wouldst be more pitiful

But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect

That I have been disloyal to thy bed

And that he is a bastard not thy son

Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind

He is as like thee as a man may be

Not like to me or any of my kin

And yet I love him

After Aumerle Mount thee upon his horse

Spur post and get before him to the King

And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee

I'll not be long behind Though I be old

I doubt not but to ride as fast as York

And never will I rise up from the ground

Till Bolingbroke have pardoned thee Away begone

What ho my liege For God's sake let me in

A woman and thy aunt great king 'Tis I

Speak with me pity me Open the door

A beggar begs that never begged before

O king believe not this hard-hearted man

Love loving not itself none other can

Sweet York be patientHear me gentle liege

Not yet I thee beseech

Forever will I walk upon my knees

And never see day that the happy sees

Till thou give joy until thou bid me joy

By pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy

Pleads he in earnest Look upon his face

His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest

His words come from his mouth ours from our breast

He prays but faintly and would be denied

We pray with heart and soul and all beside

His weary joints would gladly rise I know

Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow

His prayers are full of false hypocrisy

Ours of true zeal and deep integrity

Our prayers do outpray his Then let them have

That mercy which true prayer ought to have

Nay do not say stand up

Say pardon first and afterwards stand up

An if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach

Pardon should be the first word of thy speech

I never longed to hear a word till now

Say pardon king let pity teach thee how

The word is short but not so short as sweet

No word like pardon for kings' mouths so meet

Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy

Ah my sour husband my hard-hearted lord

That sets the word itself against the word

Speak pardon as 'tis current in our land

The chopping French we do not understand

Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there

Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear

That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce

Pity may move thee pardon to rehearse

I do not sue to stand

Pardon is all the suit I have in hand

O happy vantage of a kneeling knee

Yet am I sick for fear Speak it again

Twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain

But makes one pardon strong

A god on Earth thou art

Come my old son I pray God make thee new
