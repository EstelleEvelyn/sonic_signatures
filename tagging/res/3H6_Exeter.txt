


But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly

For shame come down He made thee Duke of York

Thy father was a traitor to the crown

No for he could not so resign his crown

But that the next heir should succeed and reign

His is the right and therefore pardon me

My conscience tells me he is lawful king

They seek revenge and therefore will not yield

Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes

Here comes the Queen whose looks bewray her anger

I'll steal away

And I I hope shall reconcile them all

Away for Vengeance comes along with them

Nay stay not to expostulate make speed

Or else come after I'll away before

The doubt is that he will seduce the rest

Hark hark my lord what shouts are these
