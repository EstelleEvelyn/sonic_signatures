


Suffolk ariseWelcome Queen Margaret

I can express no kinder sign of love

Than this kind kiss O Lord that lends me life

Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness

For Thou hast given me in this beauteous face

A world of earthly blessings to my soul

If sympathy of love unite our thoughts

Her sight did ravish but her grace in speech

Her words yclad with wisdom's majesty

Makes me from wond'ring fall to weeping joys

Such is the fullness of my heart's content

Lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love

Uncle how now

Uncle of Winchester I pray read on

They please us wellLord Marquess kneel down

We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk

And girt thee with the sword Cousin of York

Be full expiredThanks Uncle Winchester

Gloucester York Buckingham Somerset

Salisbury and Warwick

We thank you all for this great favor done

In entertainment to my princely queen

Come let us in and with all speed provide

To see her coronation be performed

For my part noble lords I care not which

Or Somerset or York all's one to me

Sweet aunt be quiet 'Twas against her will

What mean'st thou Suffolk Tell me what are these

Say man were these thy words

Uncle what shall we say to this in law

Away with them to prison and the day of

combat shall be the last of the next month

Come Somerset we'll see thee sent away

But what a point my lord your falcon made

And what a pitch she flew above the rest

To see how God in all his creatures works

Yea man and birds are fain of climbing high

The treasury of everlasting joy

I prithee peace

Good queen and whet not on these furious peers

For blessd are the peacemakers on Earth

How now my lords

Why how now uncle Gloucester

The winds grow high so do your stomachs lords

How irksome is this music to my heart

When such strings jar what hope of harmony

I pray my lords let me compound this strife

Now God be praised that to believing souls

Gives light in darkness comfort in despair

Great is his comfort in this earthly vale

Although by his sight his sin be multiplied

Good fellow tell us here the circumstance

That we for thee may glorify the Lord

What hast thou been long blind and now restored

Where wert thou born

Poor soul God's goodness hath been great to thee

Let never day nor night unhallowed pass

But still remember what the Lord hath done

Why then thou know'st what color jet is of

O God seest Thou this and bearest so long

What tidings with our cousin Buckingham

O God what mischiefs work the wicked ones

Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby

Well for this night we will repose us here

Tomorrow toward London back again

To look into this business thoroughly

And call these foul offenders to their answers

And poise the cause in Justice' equal scales

Whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails

Stand forth Dame Eleanor Cobham Gloucester's wife

In sight of God and us your guilt is great

Receive the sentence of the law for sins

Such as by God's book are adjudged to death

You four from hence to prison back again

From thence unto the place of execution

The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes

And you three shall be strangled on the gallows

You madam for you are more nobly born

Despoild of your honor in your life

Shall after three days' open penance done

Live in your country here in banishment

With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man

Stay Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Ere thou go

Give up thy staff Henry will to himself

Protector be and God shall be my hope

My stay my guide and lantern to my feet

And go in peace Humphrey no less beloved

Than when thou wert Protector to thy king

I' God's name see the lists and all things fit

Here let them end it and God defend the right

Go take hence that traitor from our sight

For by his death we do perceive his guilt

And God in justice hath revealed to us

The truth and innocence of this poor fellow

Which he had thought to have murdered wrongfully

Come fellow follow us for thy reward

I muse my lord of Gloucester is not come

'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man

Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now

My lords at once the care you have of us

To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot

Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience

Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent

From meaning treason to our royal person

As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove

The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given

To dream on evil or to work my downfall

Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France

Cold news Lord Somerset but God's will be done

My lord of Gloucester 'tis my special hope

That you will clear yourself from all suspense

My conscience tells me you are innocent

My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best

Do or undo as if ourself were here

Ay Margaret My heart is drowned with grief

Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes

My body round engirt with misery

For what's more miserable than discontent

Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see

The map of honor truth and loyalty

And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come

That e'er I proved thee false or feared thy faith

What louring star now envies thy estate

That these great lords and Margaret our queen

Do seek subversion of thy harmless life

Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong

And as the butcher takes away the calf

And binds the wretch and beats it when it strains

Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse

Even so remorseless have they borne him hence

And as the dam runs lowing up and down

Looking the way her harmless young one went

And can do naught but wail her darling's loss

Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case

With sad unhelpful tears and with dimmed eyes

Look after him and cannot do him good

So mighty are his vowd enemies

His fortunes I will weep and 'twixt each groan

Say Who's a traitor Gloucester he is none

Go call our uncle to our presence straight

Say we intend to try his Grace today

If he be guilty as 'tis publishd

Lords take your places and I pray you all

Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester

Than from true evidence of good esteem

He be approved in practice culpable

I thank thee Meg These words content me much

How now Why look'st thou pale Why tremblest thou

Where is our uncle What's the matter Suffolk

O heavenly God

What doth my lord of Suffolk comfort me

Came he right now to sing a raven's note

Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers

And thinks he that the chirping of a wren

By crying comfort from a hollow breast

Can chase away the first-conceivd sound

Hide not thy poison with such sugared words

Lay not thy hands on me Forbear I say

Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting

Thou baleful messenger out of my sight

Upon thy eyeballs murderous Tyranny

Sits in grim majesty to fright the world

Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding

Yet do not go away Come basilisk

And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight

For in the shade of death I shall find joy

In life but double death now Gloucester's dead

Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man

That he is dead good Warwick 'tis too true

But how he died God knows not Henry

Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse

And comment then upon his sudden death

O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts

My thoughts that labor to persuade my soul

Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life

If my suspect be false forgive me God

For judgment only doth belong to Thee

Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips

With twenty thousand kisses and to drain

Upon his face an ocean of salt tears

To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk

And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling

But all in vain are these mean obsequies

And to survey his dead and earthy image

What were it but to make my sorrow greater

That is to see how deep my grave is made

For with his soul fled all my worldly solace

For seeing him I see my life in death

What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted

Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just

And he but naked though locked up in steel

Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted

Why how now lords Your wrathful weapons drawn

Here in our presence Dare you be so bold

Why what tumultuous clamor have we here

Go Salisbury and tell them all from me

I thank them for their tender loving care

And had I not been cited so by them

Yet did I purpose as they do entreat

For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy

Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means

And therefore by His Majesty I swear

Whose far unworthy deputy I am

He shall not breathe infection in this air

But three days longer on the pain of death

Ungentle queen to call him gentle Suffolk

No more I say If thou dost plead for him

Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath

Had I but said I would have kept my word

But when I swear it is irrevocable

If after three days' space thou here be'st found

On any ground that I am ruler of

The world shall not be ransom for thy life

Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me

I have great matters to impart to thee

How fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign

Ah what a sign it is of evil life

Where Death's approach is seen so terrible

O Thou eternal mover of the heavens

Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch

O beat away the busy meddling fiend

That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul

And from his bosom purge this black despair

Peace to his soul if God's good pleasure be

Lord Card'nal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss

Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope

He dies and makes no sign O God forgive him

Forbear to judge for we are sinners all

Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close

And let us all to meditation

I'll send some holy bishop to entreat

For God forbid so many simple souls

Should perish by the sword And I myself

Rather than bloody war shall cut them short

Will parley with Jack Cade their general

But stay I'll read it over once again

Lord Saye Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head

How now madam

Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death

I fear me love if that I had been dead

Thou wouldst not have mourned so much for me

How now what news Why com'st thou in such haste

O graceless men they know not what they do

Lord Saye the traitors hateth thee

Therefore away with us to Killingworth

Come Margaret God our hope will succor us

Farewell my lord Trust not the Kentish rebels

Was ever king that joyed an earthly throne

And could command no more content than I

No sooner was I crept out of my cradle

But I was made a king at nine months old

Was never subject longed to be a king

As I do long and wish to be a subject

Why Buckingham is the traitor Cade surprised

Or is he but retired to make him strong

Then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates

To entertain my vows of thanks and praise

Soldiers this day have you redeemed your lives

And showed how well you love your prince and country

Continue still in this so good a mind

And Henry though he be infortunate

Assure yourselves will never be unkind

And so with thanks and pardon to you all

I do dismiss you to your several countries

Thus stands my state 'twixt Cade and York distressed

Like to a ship that having scaped a tempest

Is straightway calmed and boarded with a pirate

But now is Cade driven back his men dispersed

And now is York in arms to second him

I pray thee Buckingham go and meet him

And ask him what's the reason of these arms

Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower

And Somerset we will commit thee thither

Until his army be dismissed from him

In any case be not too rough in terms

For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language

Come wife let's in and learn to govern better

For yet may England curse my wretched reign

Buckingham doth York intend no harm to us

That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm

Then what intends these forces thou dost bring

The head of Cade Great God how just art Thou

O let me view his visage being dead

That living wrought me such exceeding trouble

Tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him

How art thou called And what is thy degree

Iden kneel down Rise up a knight

We give thee for reward a thousand marks

And will that thou henceforth attend on us

See Buckingham Somerset comes with th' Queen

Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke

Ay Clifford a bedlam and ambitious humor

Makes him oppose himself against his king

Why Warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow

Old Salisbury shame to thy silver hair

Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son

What wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian

And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles

O where is faith O where is loyalty

If it be banished from the frosty head

Where shall it find a harbor in the earth

Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war

And shame thine honorable age with blood

Why art thou old and want'st experience

Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it

For shame In duty bend thy knee to me

That bows unto the grave with mickle age

Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me

Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath

Call Buckingham and bid him arm himself

Can we outrun the heavens Good Margaret stay
