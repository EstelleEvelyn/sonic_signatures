once set a dish of applejohns before him and told

him there were five more Sir Johns and, putting off

his hat, said “I will now take my leave of these six

dry, round, old, withered knights.” It angered him

to the heart. But he hath forgot that.

By the Mass, here will be old utis. It

will be an excellent stratagem.
