England is safe, if true within itself?

’Tis better using France than trusting France.

Let us be backed with God and with the seas

Which He hath giv’n for fence impregnable,

And with their helps only defend ourselves.

In them and in ourselves our safety lies.

And Hastings as he favors Edward’s cause!

To Lynn, my lord, and shipped from thence to Flanders.

My liege, I’ll knock once more to summon them.

Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?

Open the gates. We are King Henry’s friends.

The good old man would fain that all were well,

So ’twere not long of him; but being entered,

I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade

Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.

Sound, trumpet! Edward shall be here proclaimed.—

Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.

Long live Edward the Fourth!
