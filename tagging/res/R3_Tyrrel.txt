


James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

Prove me, my gracious lord.

Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies.

Let me have open means to come to them,

And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.

I will dispatch it straight.

The tyrannous and bloody act is done,

The most arch deed of piteous massacre

That ever yet this land was guilty of.

Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn

To do this piece of ruthless butchery,

Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs,

Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,

Wept like two children in their deaths’ sad story.

“O thus,” quoth Dighton, “lay the gentle babes.”

“Thus, thus,” quoth Forrest, “girdling one another

Within their alabaster innocent arms.

Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,

And in their summer beauty kissed each other.

A book of prayers on their pillow lay,

Which once,” quoth Forrest, “almost changed my mind,

But, O, the devil—” There the villain stopped;

When Dighton thus told on: “We smotherèd

The most replenishèd sweet work of nature

That from the prime creation e’er she framed.”

Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse;

They could not speak; and so I left them both

To bear this tidings to the bloody king.

And here he comes.—All health, my sovereign lord.

If to have done the thing you gave in charge

Beget your happiness, be happy then,

For it is done.

I did, my lord.

The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them,

But where, to say the truth, I do not know.

I humbly take my leave.
