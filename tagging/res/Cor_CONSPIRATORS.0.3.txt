’Twixt you there’s difference, but the fall of either

Makes the survivor heir of all.

Sir, his stoutness

When he did stand for consul, which he lost

By lack of stooping—

Therefore at your vantage,

Ere he express himself or move the people

With what he would say, let him feel your sword,

Which we will second. When he lies along,

After your way his tale pronounced shall bury

His reasons with his body.

Let him die for ’t.

Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
