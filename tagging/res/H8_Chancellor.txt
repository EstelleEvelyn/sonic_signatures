Why are we met in council?

Let him come in.

My good lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry

To sit here at this present and behold

That chair stand empty. But we all are men,

In our own natures frail, and capable

Of our flesh—few are angels—out of which frailty

And want of wisdom you, that best should teach us,

Have misdemeaned yourself, and not a little,

Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling

The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains’—

For so we are informed—with new opinions,

Divers and dangerous, which are heresies

And, not reformed, may prove pernicious.

This is too much!

Forbear, for shame, my lords.

Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,

I take it, by all voices, that forthwith

You be conveyed to th’ Tower a prisoner,

There to remain till the King’s further pleasure

Be known unto us.—Are you all agreed, lords?

We are.

Thus far,

My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace

To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed

Concerning his imprisonment was rather,

If there be faith in men, meant for his trial

And fair purgation to the world than malice,

I’m sure, in me.
