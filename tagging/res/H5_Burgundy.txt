


My duty to you both on equal love

Great kings of France and England That I have labored

With all my wits my pains and strong endeavors

To bring your most imperial Majesties

Unto this bar and royal interview

Your Mightiness on both parts best can witness

Since then my office hath so far prevailed

That face to face and royal eye to eye

You have congreeted let it not disgrace me

If I demand before this royal view

What rub or what impediment there is

Why that the naked poor and mangled peace

Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births

Should not in this best garden of the world

Our fertile France put up her lovely visage

Alas she hath from France too long been chased

And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps

Corrupting in its own fertility

Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart

Unprund dies Her hedges even-pleached

Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair

Put forth disordered twigs Her fallow leas

The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory

Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts

That should deracinate such savagery

The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth

The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover

Wanting the scythe withal uncorrected rank

Conceives by idleness and nothing teems

But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burrs

Losing both beauty and utility

And all our vineyards fallows meads and hedges

Defective in their natures grow to wildness

Even so our houses and ourselves and children

Have lost or do not learn for want of time

The sciences that should become our country

But grow like savages as soldiers will

That nothing do but meditate on blood

To swearing and stern looks diffused attire

And everything that seems unnatural

Which to reduce into our former favor

You are assembled and my speech entreats

That I may know the let why gentle peace

Should not expel these inconveniences

And bless us with her former qualities

The King hath heard them to the which as yet

There is no answer made

God save your Majesty My royal cousin

teach you our princess English

Is she not apt

Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I

answer you for that If you would conjure in her

you must make a circle if conjure up Love in her in

his true likeness he must appear naked and blind

Can you blame her then being a maid yet rosed

over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny

the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked

seeing self It were my lord a hard condition for a

maid to consign to

They are then excused my lord when they

see not what they do

I will wink on her to consent my lord if

you will teach her to know my meaning for maids

well summered and warm kept are like flies at

Bartholomew-tide blind though they have their

eyes and then they will endure handling which

before would not abide looking on

As love is my lord before it loves

Amen
