Such as I am I come from Antony

I was of late as petty to his ends

As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf

To his grand sea

Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and

Requires to live in Egypt which not granted

He lessens his requests and to thee sues

To let him breathe between the heavens and Earth

A private man in Athens This for him

Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness

Submits her to thy might and of thee craves

The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs

Now hazarded to thy grace

Fortune pursue thee

Ay my lord

He says so
