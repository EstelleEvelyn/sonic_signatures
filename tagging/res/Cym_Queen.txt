


No be assured you shall not find me daughter

After the slander of most stepmothers

Evil-eyed unto you You're my prisoner but

Your jailer shall deliver you the keys

That lock up your restraintFor you Posthumus

So soon as I can win th' offended king

I will be known your advocate Marry yet

The fire of rage is in him and 'twere good

You leaned unto his sentence with what patience

Your wisdom may inform you

You know the peril

I'll fetch a turn about the garden pitying

The pangs of barred affections though the King

Hath charged you should not speak together

Be brief I pray you

If the King come I shall incur I know not

How much of his displeasure Yet I'll move him

To walk this way I never do him wrong

But he does buy my injuries to be friends

Pays dear for my offenses

Beseech your patiencePeace

Dear lady daughter peaceSweet sovereign

Leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort

Out of your best advice

Fie you must give way

Here is your servantHow now sir What news

Ha

No harm I trust is done

I am very glad on 't

This hath been

Your faithful servant I dare lay mine honor

He will remain so

Pray walk awhile

Whiles yet the dew's on ground gather those flowers

Make haste Who has the note of them

Dispatch

Now Master Doctor have you brought those drugs

I wonder doctor

Thou ask'st me such a question Have I not been

Thy pupil long Hast thou not learned me how

To make perfumes distil preserveyea so

That our great king himself doth woo me oft

For my confections Having thus far proceeded

Unless thou think'st me devilish is 't not meet

That I did amplify my judgment in

Other conclusions I will try the forces

Of these thy compounds on such creatures as

We count not worth the hangingbut none human

To try the vigor of them and apply

Allayments to their act and by them gather

Their several virtues and effects

O content thee

Here comes a flattering rascal Upon him

Will I first work He's for his master

And enemy to my sonHow now Pisanio

Doctor your service for this time is ended

Take your own way

Hark thee a word

No further service doctor

Until I send for thee

Weeps she still sayst thou Dost thou think in time

She will not quench and let instructions enter

Where folly now possesses Do thou work

When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son

I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then

As great as is thy master greater for

His fortunes all lie speechless and his name

Is at last gasp Return he cannot nor

Continue where he is To shift his being

Is to exchange one misery with another

And every day that comes comes to decay

A day's work in him What shalt thou expect

To be depender on a thing that leans

Who cannot be new built nor has no friends

So much as but to prop himThou tak'st up

Thou know'st not what But take it for thy labor

It is a thing I made which hath the King

Five times redeemed from death I do not know

What is more cordial Nay I prithee take it

It is an earnest of a farther good

That I mean to thee Tell thy mistress how

The case stands with her Do 't as from thyself

Think what a chance thou changest on but think

Thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son

Who shall take notice of thee I'll move the King

To any shape of thy preferment such

As thou 'lt desire and then myself I chiefly

That set thee on to this desert am bound

To load thy merit richly Call my women

Think on my words A sly and constant knave

Not to be shaked the agent for his master

And the remembrancer of her to hold

The handfast to her lord I have given him that

Which if he take shall quite unpeople her

Of liegers for her sweet and which she after

Except she bend her humor shall be assured

To taste of too    So so Well done well done

The violets cowslips and the primroses

Bear to my closetFare thee well Pisanio

Think on my words

You are most bound to th' King

Who lets go by no vantages that may

Prefer you to his daughter Frame yourself

To orderly solicits and be friended

With aptness of the season Make denials

Increase your services So seem as if

You were inspired to do those duties which

You tender to her that you in all obey her

Save when command to your dismission tends

And therein you are senseless

And to kill the marvel

Shall be so ever

That opportunity

Which then they had to take from 's to resume

We have againRemember sir my liege

The Kings your ancestors together with

The natural bravery of your isle which stands

As Neptune's park ribbed and pald in

With rocks unscalable and roaring waters

With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats

But suck them up to th' topmast A kind of conquest

Caesar made here but made not here his brag

Of came and saw and overcame With shame

The first that ever touched himhe was carried

From off our coast twice beaten and his shipping

Poor ignorant baubles on our terrible seas

Like eggshells moved upon their surges cracked

As easily 'gainst our rocks For joy whereof

The famed Cassibelan who was once at point

O giglet Fortuneto master Caesar's sword

Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright

And Britons strut with courage

He goes hence frowning but it honors us

That we have given him cause

'Tis not sleepy business

But must be looked to speedily and strongly

Royal sir

Since the exile of Posthumus most retired

Hath her life been the cure whereof my lord

'Tis time must do Beseech your Majesty

Forbear sharp speeches to her She's a lady

So tender of rebukes that words are strokes

And strokes death to her

My lord when last I went to visit her

She prayed me to excuse her keeping close

Whereto constrained by her infirmity

She should that duty leave unpaid to you

Which daily she was bound to proffer This

She wished me to make known but our great court

Made me to blame in memory

Son I say follow the King

Go look after

Pisanio thou that stand'st so for Posthumus

He hath a drug of mine I pray his absence

Proceed by swallowing that for he believes

It is a thing most precious But for her

Where is she gone Haply despair hath seized her

Or winged with fervor of her love she's flown

To her desired Posthumus Gone she is

To death or to dishonor and my end

Can make good use of either She being down

I have the placing of the British crown

How now my son

All the better May

This night forestall him of the coming day
