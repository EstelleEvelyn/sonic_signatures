By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told ’s

They are sisters’ children, nephews to the King.

Wi’ leave, they’re called

Arcite and Palamon.

Nor in a state of life. Had they been taken

When their last hurts were given, ’twas possible

They might have been recovered. Yet they breathe

And have the name of men.
