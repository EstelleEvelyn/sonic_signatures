


Princes that strive by factions and by friends

Ambitiously for rule and empery

Know that the people of Rome for whom we stand

A special party have by common voice

In election for the Roman empery

Chosen Andronicus surnamd Pius

For many good and great deserts to Rome

A nobler man a braver warrior

Lives not this day within the city walls

He by the Senate is accited home

From weary wars against the barbarous Goths

That with his sons a terror to our foes

Hath yoked a nation strong trained up in arms

Ten years are spent since first he undertook

This cause of Rome and chastisd with arms

Our enemies' pride Five times he hath returned

Bleeding to Rome bearing his valiant sons

In coffins from the field

And now at last laden with honor's spoils

Returns the good Andronicus to Rome

Renownd Titus flourishing in arms

Let us entreat by honor of his name

Whom worthily you would have now succeed

And in the Capitol and Senate's right

Whom you pretend to honor and adore

That you withdraw you and abate your strength

Dismiss your followers and as suitors should

Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness

Long live Lord Titus my belovd brother

Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome

And welcome nephews from successful wars

You that survive and you that sleep in fame

Fair lords your fortunes are alike in all

That in your country's service drew your swords

But safer triumph is this funeral pomp

That hath aspired to Solon's happiness

And triumphs over chance in honor's bed

Titus Andronicus the people of Rome

Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been

Send thee by me their tribune and their trust

This palliament of white and spotless hue

And name thee in election for the empire

With these our late deceasd emperor's sons

Be candidatus then and put it on

And help to set a head on headless Rome

Titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery

With voices and applause of every sort

Patricians and plebeians we create

Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor

And say Long live our Emperor Saturnine

Suum cuique is our Roman justice

This prince in justice seizeth but his own

O Titus see O see what thou hast done

In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son

My lord this is impiety in you

My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him

He must be buried with his brethren

No noble Titus but entreat of thee

To pardon Mutius and to bury him

Brother for in that name doth nature plead

Renownd Titus more than half my soul

Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter

His noble nephew here in virtue's nest

That died in honor and Lavinia's cause

Thou art a Roman be not barbarous

The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax

That slew himself and wise Laertes' son

Did graciously plead for his funerals

Let not young Mutius then that was thy joy

Be barred his entrance here

No man shed tears for noble Mutius

He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause

My lord to step out of these dreary dumps

How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths

Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome

That on mine honor here do I protest

I have dogs my lord

Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase

And climb the highest promontory top

Who is this My niece that flies away so fast

Cousin a word Where is your husband

If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me

If I do wake some planet strike me down

That I may slumber an eternal sleep

Speak gentle niece What stern ungentle hands

Hath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare

Of her two branches those sweet ornaments

Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in

And might not gain so great a happiness

As half thy love Why dost not speak to me

Alas a crimson river of warm blood

Like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind

Doth rise and fall between thy rosd lips

Coming and going with thy honey breath

But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee

And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue

Ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame

And notwithstanding all this loss of blood

As from a conduit with three issuing spouts

Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face

Blushing to be encountered with a cloud

Shall I speak for thee shall I say 'tis so

O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast

That I might rail at him to ease my mind

Sorrow conceald like an oven stopped

Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is

Fair Philomela why she but lost her tongue

And in a tedious sampler sewed her mind

But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee

A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met

And he hath cut those pretty fingers off

That could have better sewed than Philomel

O had the monster seen those lily hands

Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute

And make the silken strings delight to kiss them

He would not then have touched them for his life

Or had he heard the heavenly harmony

Which that sweet tongue hath made

He would have dropped his knife and fell asleep

As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet

Come let us go and make thy father blind

For such a sight will blind a father's eye

One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads

What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes

Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee

O could our mourning ease thy misery

Titus prepare thy agd eyes to weep

Or if not so thy noble heart to break

I bring consuming sorrow to thine age

This was thy daughter

O that delightful engine of her thoughts

That blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence

Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage

Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung

Sweet varied notes enchanting every ear

O thus I found her straying in the park

Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer

That hath received some unrecuring wound

Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband

Perchance because she knows them innocent

Patience dear nieceGood Titus dry thine eyes

Which of your hands hath not defended Rome

And reared aloft the bloody battleax

Writing destruction on the enemy's castle

O none of both but are of high desert

My hand hath been but idle let it serve

To ransom my two nephews from their death

Then have I kept it to a worthy end

My hand shall go

And for our father's sake and mother's care

Now let me show a brother's love to thee

But I will use the ax

O brother speak with possibility

And do not break into these deep extremes

But yet let reason govern thy lament

Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily

And be my heart an everburning hell

These miseries are more than may be borne

To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal

But sorrow flouted at is double death

Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless

As frozen water to a starvd snake

Now farewell flatt'ry die Andronicus

Thou dost not slumber See thy two sons' heads

Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here

Thy other banished son with this dear sight

Struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I

Even like a stony image cold and numb

Ah now no more will I control thy griefs

Rent off thy silver hair thy other hand

Gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight

The closing up of our most wretched eyes

Now is a time to storm Why art thou still

Why dost thou laugh It fits not with this hour

Fie brother fie Teach her not thus to lay

Such violent hands upon her tender life

Alas the tender boy in passion moved

Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness

At that that I have killed my lord a fly

Alas my lord I have but killed a fly

Pardon me sir It was a black ill-favored fly

Like to the Empress' Moor Therefore I killed him

Alas poor man grief has so wrought on him

He takes false shadows for true substances

Stand by me Lucius Do not fear thine aunt

What means my niece Lavinia by these signs

Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus

Lucius I will

I think she means that there were more than one

Confederate in the fact Ay more there was

Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge

For love of her that's gone

Perhaps she culled it from among the rest

See brother see Note how she quotes the leaves

O why should nature build so foul a den

Unless the gods delight in tragedies

Sit down sweet nieceBrother sit down by me

Apollo Pallas Jove or Mercury

Inspire me that I may this treason find

My lord look hereLook here Lavinia

This sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst

This after me I have writ my name

Without the help of any hand at all

Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift

Write thou good niece and here display at last

What God will have discovered for revenge

Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain

That we may know the traitors and the truth

O do you read my lord what she hath writ

What what The lustful sons of Tamora

Performers of this heinous bloody deed

O calm thee gentle lord although I know

There is enough written upon this earth

To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts

And arm the minds of infants to exclaims

My lord kneel down with meLavinia kneel

And kneel sweet boy the Roman Hector's hope

And swear with meas with the woeful fere

And father of that chaste dishonored dame

Lord Junius Brutus swore for Lucrece' rape

That we will prosecute by good advice

Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths

And see their blood or die with this reproach

Ay that's my boy Thy father hath full oft

For his ungrateful country done the like

O heavens can you hear a good man groan

And not relent or not compassion him

Marcus attend him in his ecstasy

That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart

Than foemen's marks upon his battered shield

But yet so just that he will not revenge

Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus

O Publius is not this a heavy case

To see thy noble uncle thus distract

Kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy

But

Join with the Goths and with revengeful war

Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude

And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine

Kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court

We will afflict the Emperor in his pride

My lord I aim a mile beyond the moon

Your letter is with Jupiter by this

This was the sport my lord when Publius shot

The Bull being galled gave Aries such a knock

That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court

And who should find them but the Empress' villain

She laughed and told the Moor he should not choose

But give them to his master for a present

Why sir that is as fit as can be to

serve for your oration and let him deliver the pigeons

to the Emperor from you

This will I do and soon return again

Rome's emperor and nephew break the parle

These quarrels must be quietly debated

The feast is ready which the careful Titus

Hath ordained to an honorable end

For peace for love for league and good to Rome

Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places

You sad-faced men people and sons of Rome

By uproars severed as a flight of fowl

Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts

O let me teach you how to knit again

This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf

These broken limbs again into one body

Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself

And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to

Like a forlorn and desperate castaway

Do shameful execution on herself

But if my frosty signs and chaps of age

Grave witnesses of true experience

Cannot induce you to attend my words

Speak Rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor

When with his solemn tongue he did discourse

To lovesick Dido's sad-attending ear

The story of that baleful burning night

When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy

Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears

Or who hath brought the fatal engine in

That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound

My heart is not compact of flint nor steel

Nor can I utter all our bitter grief

But floods of tears will drown my oratory

And break my utterance even in the time

When it should move you to attend me most

And force you to commiseration

Here's Rome's young captain Let him tell the tale

While I stand by and weep to hear him speak

Now is my turn to speak Behold the child

Of this was Tamora deliverd

The issue of an irreligious Moor

Chief architect and plotter of these woes

The villain is alive in Titus' house

And as he is to witness this is true

Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge

These wrongs unspeakable past patience

Or more than any living man could bear

Now have you heard the truth What say you Romans

Have we done aught amiss Show us wherein

And from the place where you behold us pleading

The poor remainder of Andronici

Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves

And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls

And make a mutual closure of our house

Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall

Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall

Go go into old Titus' sorrowful house

And hither hale that misbelieving Moor

To be adjudged some direful slaught'ring death

As punishment for his most wicked life

Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss

Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips

O were the sum of these that I should pay

Countless and infinite yet would I pay them

How many thousand times hath these poor lips

When they were living warmed themselves on thine

O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss

Bid him farewell commit him to the grave

Do them that kindness and take leave of them
