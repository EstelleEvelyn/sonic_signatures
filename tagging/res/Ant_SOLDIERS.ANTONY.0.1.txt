Nothing. What news?

Well, sir, goodnight.

’Tis a brave army, and full of purpose.

List, list!

Music i’ th’ air.

Peace, I say. What should this mean?

Walk. Let’s see if other watchmen

Do hear what we do.

How now? How now? Do you hear this?

Ay. Is ’t not strange?

Follow the noise so far as we have quarter.

Let’s see how it will give off.

Content. ’Tis strange.

Good morrow, general.
