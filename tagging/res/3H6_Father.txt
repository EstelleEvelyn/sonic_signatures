Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold,

For I have bought it with an hundred blows.

But let me see: is this our foeman’s face?

Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!

Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,

Throw up thine eye! See, see, what showers arise,

Blown with the windy tempest of my heart

Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!

O, pity God this miserable age!

What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,

Erroneous, mutinous, and unnatural

This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!

O, boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,

And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!

How will my wife for slaughter of my son

Shed seas of tears and ne’er be satisfied!

Was ever father so bemoaned his son?

These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;

My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulcher,

For from my heart thine image ne’er shall go.

My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;

And so obsequious will thy father be

E’en for the loss of thee, having no more,

As Priam was for all his valiant sons.

I’ll bear thee hence, and let them fight that will,

For I have murdered where I should not kill.
