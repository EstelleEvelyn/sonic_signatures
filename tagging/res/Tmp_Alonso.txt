Play the men.

Prithee, peace.

I prithee, spare.

You cram these words into mine ears against

The stomach of my sense. Would I had never

Married my daughter there, for coming thence

My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,

Who is so far from Italy removed

I ne’er again shall see her.—O, thou mine heir

Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish

Hath made his meal on thee?

No, no, he’s gone.

Prithee, peace.

So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.

Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me.

What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes

Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find

They are inclined to do so.

Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

Why, how now, ho! Awake? Why are you drawn?

Wherefore this ghastly looking?

I heard nothing.

Heard you this, Gonzalo?

Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search

For my poor son.

Lead away.

Old lord, I cannot blame thee.

Who am myself attached with weariness

To th’ dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest.

Even here I will put off my hope and keep it

No longer for my flatterer. He is drowned

Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks

Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

What harmony is this? My good friends, hark.

Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

I cannot too much muse

Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing—

Although they want the use of tongue—a kind

Of excellent dumb discourse.

Not I.

I will stand to and feed.

Although my last, no matter, since I feel

The best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke,

Stand to, and do as we.

O, it is monstrous, monstrous!

Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;

The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,

That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced

The name of Prosper. It did bass my trespass.

Therefor my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded, and

I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,

And with him there lie mudded.

Whe’er thou be’st he or no,

Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me

(As late I have been) I not know. Thy pulse

Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,

Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which

I fear a madness held me. This must crave,

An if this be at all, a most strange story.

Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat

Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero

Be living and be here?

If thou be’st Prospero,

Give us particulars of thy preservation,

How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since

Were wracked upon this shore, where I have lost—

How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—

My dear son Ferdinand.

Irreparable is the loss, and patience

Says it is past her cure.

You the like loss?

A daughter?

O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,

The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish

Myself were mudded in that oozy bed

Where my son lies!—When did you lose your daughter?

If this prove

A vision of the island, one dear son

Shall I twice lose.

Now, all the blessings

Of a glad father compass thee about!

Arise, and say how thou cam’st here.

What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?

Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours.

Is she the goddess that hath severed us

And brought us thus together?

I am hers.

But, O, how oddly will it sound that I

Must ask my child forgiveness!

I say “Amen,” Gonzalo.

Give me your hands.

Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart

That doth not wish you joy!

These are not natural events. They strengthen

From strange to stranger.—Say, how came you hither?

This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod,

And there is in this business more than nature

Was ever conduct of. Some oracle

Must rectify our knowledge.

Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they

Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?

How cam’st thou in this pickle?

This is as strange a thing as e’er I looked on.

Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

I long

To hear the story of your life, which must

Take the ear strangely.
