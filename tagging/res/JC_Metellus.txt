


O let us have him for his silver hairs

Will purchase us a good opinion

And buy men's voices to commend our deeds

It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands

Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear

But all be buried in his gravity

Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard

Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey

I wonder none of you have thought of him

Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar

Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat

An humble heart

Is there no voice more worthy than my own

To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear

For the repealing of my banished brother

Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesar's

Should chance
