


Stand sir and throw us that you have about you

If not we'll make you sit and rifle you

Ay by my beard will we for he is a proper man

Have you long sojourned there

By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar

This fellow were a king for our wild faction

Know then that some of us are gentlemen

Such as the fury of ungoverned youth

Thrust from the company of awful men

Myself was from Verona banishd

For practicing to steal away a lady

An heir and near allied unto the Duke

What sayst thou Wilt thou be of our consort

Say ay and be the captain of us all

We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee

Love thee as our commander and our king

No we detest such vile base practices

Come go with us we'll bring thee to our crews

And show thee all the treasure we have got

Which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose

Being nimble-footed he hath outrun us

But Moyses and Valerius follow him

Go thou with her to the west end of the wood

There is our captain We'll follow him that's fled

The thicket is beset he cannot 'scape

A prize a prize a prize
