Whate’er Lord Harry Percy then had said

To such a person and in such a place,

At such a time, with all the rest retold,

May reasonably die and never rise

To do him wrong or any way impeach

What then he said, so he unsay it now.

So hath the business that I come to speak of.

Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word

That Douglas and the English rebels met

The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.

A mighty and a fearful head they are,

If promises be kept on every hand,

As ever offered foul play in a state.

I come with gracious offers from the King,

If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.

And God defend but still I should stand so,

So long as out of limit and true rule

You stand against anointed majesty.

But to my charge. The King hath sent to know

The nature of your griefs, and whereupon

You conjure from the breast of civil peace

Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land

Audacious cruelty. If that the King

Have any way your good deserts forgot,

Which he confesseth to be manifold,

He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed

You shall have your desires with interest

And pardon absolute for yourself and these

Herein misled by your suggestion.

Tut, I came not to hear this.

Shall I return this answer to the King?

I would you would accept of grace and love.

Pray God you do.

What is thy name that in the battle thus

Thou crossest me? What honor dost thou seek

Upon my head?

They tell thee true.

I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,

And thou shalt find a king that will revenge

Lord Stafford’s death.
