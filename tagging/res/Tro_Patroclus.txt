No more words Thersites Peace

A good riddance

Who's there Thersites Good

Thersites come in and rail

What art thou devout Wast thou in

prayer

Amen

Thersites my lord

Thy lord Thersites Then tell me I pray

thee what's Thersites

Thou must tell that knowest

You rascal

Why am I a fool

Within his tent but ill-disposed my lord

I shall say so to him

Achilles bids me say he is much sorry

If anything more than your sport and pleasure

Did move your greatness and this noble state

To call upon him He hopes it is no other

But for your health and your digestion sake

An after-dinner's breath

I shall and bring his answer presently

They pass by strangely They were used to bend

To send their smiles before them to Achilles

To come as humbly as they use to creep

To holy altars

To this effect Achilles have I moved you

A woman impudent and mannish grown

Is not more loathed than an effeminate man

In time of action I stand condemned for this

They think my little stomach to the war

And your great love to me restrains you thus

Sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid

Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold

And like a dewdrop from the lion's mane

Be shook to air

Ay and perhaps receive much honor by him

O then beware

Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves

Omission to do what is necessary

Seals a commission to a blank of danger

And danger like an ague subtly taints

Even then when they sit idly in the sun

Jove

bless great Ajax

I come from the worthy Achilles

Who most humbly desires you to invite

Hector to his tent

And to procure safe-conduct from

Agamemnon

Ay my lord

What say you to 't

Your answer sir

Your answer sir

But that's no argument for kissing now

For thus popped Paris in his hardiment

And parted thus you and your argument

The first was Menelaus' kiss this mine

Patroclus kisses you

Paris and I kiss evermore for him

The Trojan's trumpet

Here comes Thersites

Who keeps the tent now

Well said adversity And what need these

tricks

Male varlet you rogue What's that

Why thou damnable box of envy thou

what means thou to curse thus

Why no you ruinous butt you whoreson

indistinguishable cur no

Out gall
