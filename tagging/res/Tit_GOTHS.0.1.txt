


Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus

Whose name was once our terror now our comfort

Whose high exploits and honorable deeds

Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt

Be bold in us We'll follow where thou lead'st

Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day

Led by their master to the flowered fields

And be avenged on cursd Tamora

And as he saith so say we all with him

And ours with thine befall what fortune will
