


How is the King employed

No his conscience

Has crept too near another lady

Pray God he do He'll never know himself else

And free us from his slavery

For me my lords

I love him not nor fear him there's my creed

As I am made without him so I'll stand

If the King please His curses and his blessings

Touch me alike they're breath I not believe in

I knew him and I know him so I leave him

To him that made him proud the Pope

How sad he looks Sure he is much afflicted

Not to speak of

I would not be so sick though for his place

But this cannot continue

I another

Which of the peers

Have uncontemned gone by him or at least

Strangely neglected When did he regard

The stamp of nobleness in any person

Out of himself

Most strangely

The Cardinal's letters to the Pope miscarried

And came to th' eye o' th' King wherein was read

How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness

To stay the judgment o' th' divorce for if

It did take place I do quoth he perceive

My king is tangled in affection to

A creature of the Queen's Lady Anne Bullen

Believe it

May you be happy in your wish my lord

For I profess you have it

My amen to 't

There's order given for her coronation

Marry this is yet but young and may be left

To some ears unrecounted But my lords

She is a gallant creature and complete

In mind and feature I persuade me from her

Will fall some blessing to this land which shall

In it be memorized

No no

There be more wasps that buzz about his nose

Will make this sting the sooner Cardinal Campeius

Is stol'n away to Rome hath ta'en no leave

Has left the cause o' th' King unhandled and

Is posted as the agent of our cardinal

To second all his plot I do assure you

The King cried Ha at this

He is returned in his opinions which

Have satisfied the King for his divorce

Together with all famous colleges

Almost in Christendom Shortly I believe

His second marriage shall be published and

Her coronation Katherine no more

Shall be called queen but princess dowager

And widow to Prince Arthur

He has and we shall see him

For it an archbishop

'Tis so

The Cardinal

Maybe he hears the King

Does whet his anger to him

The King the King

Who dare cross 'em

Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly

Then that without the knowledge

Either of king or council when you went

Ambassador to the Emperor you made bold

To carry into Flanders the great seal

That out of mere ambition you have caused

Your holy hat to be stamped on the King's coin

Lord Cardinal the King's further pleasure is

Because all those things you have done of late

By your power legative within this kingdom

Fall into th' compass of a praemunire

That therefore such a writ be sued against you

To forfeit all your goods lands tenements

Chattels and whatsoever and to be

Out of the King's protection This is my charge

Sir I did never win of you before

God safely quit her of her burden and

With gentle travail to the gladding of

Your Highness with an heir

I wish your Highness

A quiet night and my good mistress will

Remember in my prayers

Nay my lord

That cannot be You are a councillor

And by that virtue no man dare accuse you

We are

'Tis the right ring by heaven I told you all

When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling

'Twould fall upon ourselves
