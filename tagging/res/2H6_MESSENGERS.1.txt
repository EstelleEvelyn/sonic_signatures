Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,

Descended from the Duke of Clarence’ house,

And calls your Grace usurper, openly,

And vows to crown himself in Westminster.

His army is a ragged multitude

Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless.

Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother’s death

Hath given them heart and courage to proceed.

All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen

They call false caterpillars and intend their death.
