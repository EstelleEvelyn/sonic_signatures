


Her obsequies have been as far enlarged

As we have warranty Her death was doubtful

And but that great command o'ersways the order

She should in ground unsanctified been lodged

Till the last trumpet For charitable prayers

Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her

Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants

Her maiden strewments and the bringing home

Of bell and burial

No more be done

We should profane the service of the dead

To sing a requiem and such rest to her

As to peace-parted souls
