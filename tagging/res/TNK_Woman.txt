
’Tis called narcissus, madam.

They could not be to one so fair.

I think I should not, madam.

Why, madam?

Yes.

Dainty, madam.

Why, gentle madam?

Yet, good madam,

Sometimes her modesty will blow so far

She falls for ’t. A maid,

If she have any honor, would be loath

To take example by her.

I could lie down, I am sure.

That’s as we bargain, madam.
