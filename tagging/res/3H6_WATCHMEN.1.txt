


Come on my masters each man take his stand

The King by this is set him down to sleep

Why no for he hath made a solemn vow

Never to lie and take his natural rest

Till Warwick or himself be quite suppressed

'Tis the Lord Hastings the King's chiefest friend

Unless our halberds did shut up his passage

Who goes there
