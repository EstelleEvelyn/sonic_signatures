


The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge

My gracious liege when that my father lived

Your brother did employ my father much

And once dispatched him in an embassy

To Germany there with the Emperor

To treat of high affairs touching that time

Th' advantage of his absence took the King

And in the meantime sojourned at my father's

Where how he did prevail I shame to speak

But truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores

Between my father and my mother lay

As I have heard my father speak himself

When this same lusty gentleman was got

Upon his deathbed he by will bequeathed

His lands to me and took it on his death

That this my mother's son was none of his

An if he were he came into the world

Full fourteen weeks before the course of time

Then good my liege let me have what is mine

My father's land as was my father's will

Shall then my father's will be of no force

To dispossess that child which is not his
