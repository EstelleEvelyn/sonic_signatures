Mort de ma vie, if they march along

Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom

To buy a slobb’ry and a dirty farm

In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

They bid us to the English dancing-schools,

And teach lavoltas high, and swift corantos,

Saying our grace is only in our heels

And that we are most lofty runaways.
