Madam madam

First madam he is well

Good madam hear me

Will 't please you hear me

Madam he's well

And friends with Caesar

Caesar and he are greater friends than ever

But yet madam

Free madam no I made no such report

He's bound unto Octavia

For the best turn i' th' bed

Madam he's married to Octavia

Good madam patience

Gracious madam

I that do bring the news made not the match

He's married madam

Nay then I'll run

What mean you madam I have made no fault

I have done my duty

He's married madam

Should I lie madam

I crave your Highness' pardon

Take no offense that I would not offend you

To punish me for what you make me do

Seems much unequal He's married to Octavia

Most gracious Majesty

Ay dread queen

Madam in Rome

I looked her in the face and saw her led

Between her brother and Mark Antony

She is not madam

Madam I heard her speak She is low-voiced

She creeps

Her motion and her station are as one

She shows a body rather than a life

A statue than a breather

Or I have no observance

Madam she was a widow

And I do think she's thirty

Round even to faultiness

Brown madam and her forehead

As low as she would wish it
