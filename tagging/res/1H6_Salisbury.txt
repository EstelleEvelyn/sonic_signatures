How wert thou handled being prisoner

Or by what means gott'st thou to be released

Discourse I prithee on this turret's top

Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertained

I grieve to hear what torments you endured

But we will be revenged sufficiently

Now it is supper time in Orleance

Here through this grate I count each one

And view the Frenchmen how they fortify

Let us look in the sight will much delight thee

Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale

Let me have your express opinions

Where is best place to make our batt'ry next

O Lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
