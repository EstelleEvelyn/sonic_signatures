
Sir, he may live.

I saw him beat the surges under him

And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,

Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted

The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head

’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared

Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke

To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,

As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt

He came alive to land.

They vanished strangely.
