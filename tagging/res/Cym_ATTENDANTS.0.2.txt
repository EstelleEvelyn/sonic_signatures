
Good my liege

The day that she was missing he was here

I dare be bound he's true and shall perform

All parts of his subjection loyally For Cloten

There wants no diligence in seeking him

And will no doubt be found

So please your Majesty

The Roman legions all from Gallia drawn

Are landed on your coast with a supply

Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent

Good my liege

Your preparation can affront no less

Than what you hear of Come more for more you're ready

The want is but to put those powers in motion

That long to move
