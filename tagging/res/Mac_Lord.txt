
The son of Duncan

(From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth)

Lives in the English court and is received

Of the most pious Edward with such grace

That the malevolence of fortune nothing

Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff

Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid

To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward

That, by the help of these (with Him above

To ratify the work), we may again

Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,

Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,

Do faithful homage, and receive free honors,

All which we pine for now. And this report

Hath so exasperate the King that he

Prepares for some attempt of war.

He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”

The cloudy messenger turns me his back

And hums, as who should say “You’ll rue the time

That clogs me with this answer.”

I’ll send my prayers with him.
