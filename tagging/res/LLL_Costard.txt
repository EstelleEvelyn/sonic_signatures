


Sir the contempts thereof are as touching

me

The matter is to me sir as concerning

Jaquenetta The manner of it is I was taken with

the manner

In manner and form following sir all those

three I was seen with her in the manor house

sitting with her upon the form and taken following

her into the park which put together is in manner

and form following Now sir for the manner

It is the manner of a man to speak to a woman For

the formin some form

As it shall follow in my correction and God

defend the right

Such is the sinplicity of man to hearken after

the flesh

Not a word of Costard yet

It may be so but if he say it is so he is in

telling true but so

Be to me and every man that dares not fight

Of other men's secrets I beseech you

Me

Me

Still me

O me

With a wench

Sir I confess the wench

I do confess much of the hearing it but little

of the marking of it

I was taken with none sir I was taken with a

damsel

This was no damsel neither sir She was a

virgin

If it were I deny her virginity I was taken

with a maid

This maid will serve my turn sir

I had rather pray a month with mutton and

porridge

I suffer for the truth sir for true it is I was

taken with Jaquenetta and Jaquenetta is a true

girl And therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity

Affliction may one day smile again and till

then sit thee down sorrow

Well sir I hope when I do it I shall do it on

a full stomach

I am more bound to you than your fellows

for they are but lightly rewarded

Let me not be pent up sir I will

fast being loose

Well if ever I do see the merry days of

desolation that I have seen some shall see

Nay nothing Master Mote but what they

look upon It is not for prisoners to be too silent in

their words and therefore I will say nothing I thank

God I have as little patience as another man and

therefore I can be quiet

No egma no riddle no l'envoi no salve in

the mail sir O sir plantain a plain plantain No

l'envoi no l'envoi no salve sir but a plantain

The boy hath sold him a bargaina goose that's flat

Sir your pennyworth is good an your goose be fat

To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose

Let me see a fat l'envoiay that's a fat goose

True and I for a plantain Thus came your

argument in Then the boy's fat l'envoi the goose

that you bought and he ended the market

Thou hast no feeling of it Mote I will speak

that l'envoi

I Costard running out that was safely within

Fell over the threshold and broke my shin

Till there be more matter in the shin

O marry me to one Frances I smell some

l'envoi some goose in this

True true and now you will be my purgation

and let me loose

My sweet ounce of man's flesh my incony Jew

Now will I look to his remuneration

Remuneration O that's the Latin word for

three farthings Three farthingsremuneration

What's the price of this inkle One penny No

I'll give you a remuneration Why it carries it

Remuneration Why it is a fairer name than French

crown I will never buy and sell out of this word

Pray you sir how much carnation ribbon

may a man buy for a remuneration

Marry sir halfpenny farthing

I thank your Worship God be wi' you

When would you have it done sir

Well I will do it sir Fare you well

I shall know sir when I have done it

I will come to your Worship tomorrow

morning

Gardon O sweet

gardon Better than remuneration a 'levenpence

farthing better Most sweet gardon I will do it sir

in print Gardon Remuneration

God dig-you-den all Pray you which is the

head lady

Which is the greatest lady the highest

The thickest and the tallest it is so truth is truth

An your waist mistress were as slender as my wit

One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit

Are not you the chief woman You are the thickest here

I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to

one Lady Rosaline

I told you my lord

From my lord to my lady

From my Lord Berowne a good master of mine

To a lady of France that he called Rosaline

By my troth most pleasant How both did fit it

Indeed he must shoot nearer or he'll ne'er hit the clout

Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin

She's too hard for you at pricks sir Challenge her to bowl

By my soul a swain a most simple clown

Lord Lord how the ladies and I have put him down

O' my troth most sweet jests most incony vulgar wit

When it comes so smoothly off so obscenely as it were so fit

Armado o' th' one side O a most dainty man

To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan

To see him kiss his hand and how most sweetly he will swear

And his page o' t' other side that handful of wit

Ah heavens it is a most pathetical nit

Sola sola

Marry Master Schoolmaster he that is likeliest

to a hogshead

Have with thee my girl

Some certain treason

Nay it makes nothing sir

Of Dun Adramadio Dun Adramadio

Walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay

O they have lived long on the

almsbasket of words I marvel thy master hath not

eaten thee for a word for thou art not so long by the

head as honorificabilitudinitatibus Thou art easier

swallowed than a flapdragon

An I had but one penny in the world thou

shouldst have it to buy gingerbread Hold there is

the very remuneration I had of thy master thou

halfpenny purse of wit thou pigeon egg of discretion

O an the heavens were

so pleased that thou wert but my bastard what a

joyful father wouldest thou make me Go to thou

hast it ad dunghill at the fingers' ends as they say

O Lord sir they would know

Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no

No sir but it is vara fine

For every one pursents three

Not so sir under correction sir I hope it is not so

You cannot beg us sir I can assure you sir we know what we know

I hope sir three times thrice sir

Under correction sir we know whereuntil it

doth amount

O Lord sir it were pity you should get your

living by reckoning sir

O Lord sir the parties themselves the actors

sir will show whereuntil it doth amount For

mine own part I am as they say but to parfect one

man in one poor manPompion the Great sir

It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey

the Great For mine own part I know not the

degree of the Worthy but I am to stand for him

We will turn it finely off sir We will take some care

I Pompey am

I Pompey am

I Pompey am Pompey surnamed the Big

It is Great sirPompey surnamed the Great

That oft in field with targe and shield did make my foe to sweat

And traveling along this coast I here am come by chance

And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France

If your Ladyship would say Thanks Pompey I

had done

'Tis not so much worth but I hope I was

perfect I made a little fault in Great

Your servant and Costard

O sir you have overthrown

Alisander the Conqueror You will be scraped out of

the painted cloth for this Your lion that holds his

polax sitting on a close-stool will be given to Ajax

He will be the ninth Worthy A conqueror and

afeard to speak Run away for shame Alisander

There an 't shall please you a foolish mild man an

honest man look you and soon dashed He is a

marvelous good neighbor faith and a very good

bowler But for Alisanderalas you see how 'tis

a little o'erparted But there are Worthies a-coming

will speak their mind in some other sort

Fellow Hector she is gone she is two

months on her way

Faith unless you play the honest Troyan the

poor wench is cast away She's quick the child

brags in her belly already 'Tis yours

Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta

that is quick by him and hanged for Pompey

that is dead by him

I will not fight with a pole like a northern

man I'll slash I'll do it by the swordI bepray

you let me borrow my arms again

I'll do it in my shirt
