I came this way so happily. The King

Shall understand it presently.

I’ll show your Grace the strangest sight.

I think your Highness saw this many a day.

There, my lord:

The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury,

Who holds his state at door, ’mongst pursuivants,

Pages, and footboys.
