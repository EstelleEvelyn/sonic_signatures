water but for the party that owed it he might have

more diseases than he knew for

He said sir you should procure him better

assurance than Bardolph He would not take his

band and yours He liked not the security

He's gone in Smithfield to buy your Worship a

horse

Sir here comes the nobleman that

committed the Prince for striking him about

Bardolph

You must speak louder My master is deaf

Sir

Seven groats and two pence

Away you scullion you rampallian you fustilarian

I'll tickle your catastrophe

He calls me e'en now my lord through a red

lattice and I could discern no part of his face from

the window At last I spied his eyes and methought

he had made two holes in the ale-wife's new

petticoat and so peeped through

Away you rascally Althea's dream away

Marry my lord Althea dreamt she was delivered

of a firebrand and therefore I call him her dream

Ephesians my lord of the old church

None my lord but old Mistress Quickly and

Mistress Doll Tearsheet

A proper gentlewoman sir and a kinswoman of

my master's

And for mine sir I will govern it

Pray thee go down

The music is come sir
