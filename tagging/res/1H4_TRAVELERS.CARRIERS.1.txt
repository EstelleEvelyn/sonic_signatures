I’ll be hanged. Charles’s Wain is over the new

chimney, and yet our horse not packed.—What,

ostler!

I prithee, Tom, beat Cut’s saddle. Put a

few flocks in the point. Poor jade is wrung in the

withers out of all cess.

Poor fellow never joyed since the price

of oats rose. It was the death of him.

Like a tench? By the Mass, there is

ne’er a king christen could be better bit than I have

been since the first cock.

What, ostler, come away and be

hanged. Come away.

God’s body, the turkeys in my pannier

are quite starved.—What, ostler! A plague on thee!

Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Canst not hear?

An ’twere not as good deed as drink to break the

pate on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be

hanged. Hast no faith in thee?

I think it be two o’clock.

Nay, by God, soft. I know a trick worth

two of that, i’ faith.
