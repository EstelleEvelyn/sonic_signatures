


Roses their sharp spines being gone

Not royal in their smells alone

But in their hue

Maiden pinks of odor faint

Daisies smell-less yet most quaint

And sweet thyme true

Primrose firstborn child of Ver

Merry springtime's harbinger

With her bells dim

Oxlips in their cradles growing

Marigolds on deathbeds blowing

Lark's-heels trim

All dear Nature's children sweet

Lie 'fore bride and bridegroom's feet

Blessing their sense

Not an angel of the air

Bird melodious or bird fair

Is absent hence

The crow the sland'rous cuckoo nor

The boding raven nor chough hoar

Nor chatt'ring pie

May on our bridehouse perch or sing

Or with them any discord bring

But from it fly
