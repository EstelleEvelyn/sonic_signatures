Suddenly taken, and hath sent posthaste

To entreat your Majesty to visit him.

At Ely House.

Amen!

Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.

You promised, when you parted with the King,

To lay aside life-harming heaviness

And entertain a cheerful disposition.

Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows

Which shows like grief itself but is not so;

For sorrow’s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,

Divides one thing entire to many objects,

Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon

Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry

Distinguish form. So your sweet Majesty,

Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,

Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail,

Which, looked on as it is, is naught but shadows

Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,

More than your lord’s departure weep not. More is not seen,

Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,

Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

Why have you not proclaimed Northumberland

And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

Despair not, madam.

The wind sits fair for news to go for Ireland,

But none returns. For us to levy power

Proportionable to the enemy

Is all unpossible.

Wherein the King stands generally condemned.

Thither will I with you, for little office

Will the hateful commons perform for us,

Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.—

Will you go along with us?

That’s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

Well, we may meet again.

More welcome is the stroke of death to me

Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
