
Now, in good time!

I was promised them against the feast, but they

come not too late now.

He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe

he has paid you more, which will shame you to give

him again.

I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry

lace and a pair of sweet gloves.

Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print

alife, for then we are sure they are true.

Is it true, think you?

Pray you now, buy it.

Let’s have some merry ones.

We can both sing it. If thou ’lt bear a part, thou

shalt hear; ’tis in three parts.

O, whither?

It becomes thy oath full well

Thou to me thy secrets tell.

Or thou goest to th’ grange or mill.

Thou hast sworn it more to me.

Then whither goest? Say whither.
