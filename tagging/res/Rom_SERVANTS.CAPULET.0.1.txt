to take away He shift a trencher He scrape a

trencher

Away with the joint stools remove

the court cupboard look to the plate

Good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as

thou loves me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone

and NellAnthony and Potpan

You are looked for and called for

asked for and sought for in the great chamber

You shall have none ill sir for I'll try if

they can lick their fingers

Marry sir 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick

his own fingers Therefore he that cannot lick his

fingers goes not with me

Things for the cook sir but I know not what
