His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.

Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes

Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm

Excite the mortified man.

What does the tyrant?

Who, then, shall blame

His pestered senses to recoil and start

When all that is within him does condemn

Itself for being there?

We doubt it nothing.

The Wood of Birnam.
