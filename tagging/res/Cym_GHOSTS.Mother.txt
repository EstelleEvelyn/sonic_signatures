But took me in my throes,

That from me was Posthumus ripped,

Came crying ’mongst his foes,

A thing of pity.

With marriage wherefore was he mocked,

To be exiled and thrown

From Leonati seat, and cast

From her, his dearest one,

Sweet Imogen?

Since, Jupiter, our son is good,

Take off his miseries.

Thanks, Jupiter.
