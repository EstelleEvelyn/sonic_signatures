


Thus after greeting speaks the King of France

In my behavior to the majesty

The borrowed majesty of England here

Philip of France in right and true behalf

Of thy deceasd brother Geoffrey's son

Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim

To this fair island and the territories

To Ireland Poitiers Anjou Touraine Maine

Desiring thee to lay aside the sword

Which sways usurpingly these several titles

And put the same into young Arthur's hand

Thy nephew and right royal sovereign

The proud control of fierce and bloody war

To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld

Then take my king's defiance from my mouth

The farthest limit of my embassy

Then turn your forces from this paltry siege

And stir them up against a mightier task

England impatient of your just demands

Hath put himself in arms The adverse winds

Whose leisure I have stayed have given him time

To land his legions all as soon as I

His marches are expedient to this town

His forces strong his soldiers confident

With him along is come the Mother Queen

An Ate stirring him to blood and strife

With her her niece the Lady Blanche of Spain

With them a bastard of the King's deceased

And all th' unsettled humors of the land

Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries

With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens

Have sold their fortunes at their native homes

Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs

To make a hazard of new fortunes here

In brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits

Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er

Did never float upon the swelling tide

To do offense and scathe in Christendom

The interruption of their churlish drums

Cuts off more circumstance They are at hand

To parley or to fight therefore prepare
