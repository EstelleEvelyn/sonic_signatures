


Who is that calls so coldly

Is my master and his wife coming Grumio

Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported

Away you three-inch fool I am no beast

I prithee good Grumio tell me how goes the

world

There's fire ready And therefore good Grumio

the news

Come you are so full of cony-catching

All ready And therefore I pray thee news

How

Let's ha' t good Grumio

Here

This 'tis to feel a tale not to hear a tale

Both of one horse

Why a horse

By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she

They are

Do you hear ho You must meet

my master to countenance my mistress

Who knows not that

I call them forth to credit her

In her chamber

Making a sermon of continency to her

And rails and swears and rates that she poor soul

Knows not which way to stand to look to speak

And sits as one new-risen from a dream

Away away for he is coming hither
