


Shame and eternal shame nothing but shame

Let us die In once more Back again

And he that will not follow Bourbon now

Let him go hence and with his cap in hand

Like a base pander hold the chamber door

Whilst by a slave no gentler than my dog

His fairest daughter is contaminate

The devil take order now I'll to the throng

Let life be short else shame will be too long
