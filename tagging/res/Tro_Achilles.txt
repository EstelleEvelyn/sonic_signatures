thusHow now Thersites What's the matter

man

Ay what's the matter

So I do What's the matter

Well why so I do

I know that fool

What

Nay good Ajax

Nay I must hold you

Peace fool

Will you set your wit to a fool's

What's the quarrel

Your last service was suff'rance 'twas not

voluntary No man is beaten voluntary Ajax was

here the voluntary and you as under an impress

What with me too Thersites

What What

There's for you Patroclus

Marry this sir is proclaimed through all our host

That Hector by the fifth hour of the sun

Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy

Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms

That hath a stomach and such a one that dare

MaintainI know not what 'tis trash Farewell

I know not 'Tis put to lott'ry Otherwise

He knew his man

Who's there

Where Where O where

Art thou come Why my cheese my

digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my

table so many meals Come what's Agamemnon

O tell tell

He is a privileged manProceed

Thersites

Derive this Come

Patroclus I'll speak with nobodyCome in

with me Thersites

What comes the General to speak with me

You know my mind I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy

No

Good day good day

What does the cuckold scorn me

Good morrow Ajax

Good morrow

What mean these fellows Know they not Achilles

What am I poor of late

'Tis certain greatness once fall'n out with Fortune

Must fall out with men too What the declined is

He shall as soon read in the eyes of others

As feel in his own fall for men like butterflies

Show not their mealy wings but to the summer

And not a man for being simply man

Hath any honor but honor for those honors

That are without himas place riches and favor

Prizes of accident as oft as merit

Which when they fall as being slippery slanders

The love that leaned on them as slippery too

Doth one pluck down another and together

Die in the fall But 'tis not so with me

Fortune and I are friends I do enjoy

At ample point all that I did possess

Save these men's looks who do methinks find out

Something not worth in me such rich beholding

As they have often given Here is Ulysses

I'll interrupt his readingHow now Ulysses

What are you reading

This is not strange Ulysses

The beauty that is borne here in the face

The bearer knows not but commends itself

To others' eyes nor doth the eye itself

That most pure spirit of sense behold itself

Not going from itself but eye to eye opposed

Salutes each other with each other's form

For speculation turns not to itself

Till it hath traveled and is mirrored there

Where it may see itself This is not strange at all

I do believe it for they passed by me

As misers do by beggars neither gave to me

Good word nor look What are my deeds forgot

Of this my privacy

I have strong reasons

Ha Known

Shall Ajax fight with Hector

I see my reputation is at stake

My fame is shrewdly gored

Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus

I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him

T' invite the Trojan lords after the combat

To see us here unarmed I have a woman's longing

An appetite that I am sick withal

To see great Hector in his weeds of peace

To talk with him and to behold his visage

Even to my full of view    A labor saved

What

How so

How can that be

Thou must be my ambassador to him

Thersites

To him Patroclus Tell him I humbly desire

the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector

to come unarmed to my tent and to procure safe-conduct

for his person of the magnanimous and

most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honored captain

general of the Grecian army Agamemnon

et cetera Do this

Why but he is not in this tune is he

Come thou shalt bear a letter to him

straight

My mind is troubled like a fountain stirred

And I myself see not the bottom of it

'Tis but early days

I'll take that winter from your lips fair lady

Achilles bids you welcome

The Trojan's trumpet

But securely done

A little proudly and great deal misprizing

The knight opposed

If not Achilles nothing

A maiden battle then O I perceive you

I shall forestall thee Lord Ulysses thou

Now Hector I have fed mine eyes on thee

I have with exact view perused thee Hector

And quoted joint by joint

I am Achilles

Behold thy fill

Thou art too brief I will the second time

As I would buy thee view thee limb by limb

Tell me you heavens in which part of his body

Shall I destroy himwhether there or there or there

That I may give the local wound a name

And make distinct the very breach whereout

Hector's great spirit flew Answer me heavens

I tell thee yea

Dost thou entreat me Hector

Tomorrow do I meet thee fell as death

Tonight all friends

I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine tonight

Which with my scimitar I'll cool tomorrow

Patroclus let us feast him to the height

How now thou core of envy

Thou crusty botch of nature what's the news

From whence fragment

My sweet Patroclus I am thwarted quite

From my great purpose in tomorrow's battle

Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba

A token from her daughter my fair love

Both taxing me and gaging me to keep

An oath that I have sworn I will not break it

Fall Greeks fail fame honor or go or stay

My major vow lies here this I'll obey

Come come Thersites help to trim my tent

This night in banqueting must all be spent

Away Patroclus

Welcome brave Hector Welcome princes all

Good night and welcome both at once to those

That go or tarry

Old Nestor tarries and you too Diomed

Keep Hector company an hour or two

Come come enter my tent

Where is this Hector

Come come thou boy-queller show thy face

Know what it is to meet Achilles angry

Hector Where's Hector I will none but Hector

Now do I see thee Ha Have at thee Hector

I do disdain thy courtesy proud Trojan

Be happy that my arms are out of use

My rest and negligence befriends thee now

But thou anon shalt hear of me again

Till when go seek thy fortune

Come here about me you my Myrmidons

Mark what I say Attend me where I wheel

Strike not a stroke but keep yourselves in breath

And when I have the bloody Hector found

Empale him with your weapons round about

In fellest manner execute your arms

Follow me sirs and my proceedings eye

It is decreed Hector the great must die

Look Hector how the sun begins to set

How ugly night comes breathing at his heels

Even with the vail and dark'ning of the sun

To close the day up Hector's life is done

Strike fellows strike This is the man I seek

So Ilium fall thou next Come Troy sink down

Here lies thy heart thy sinews and thy bone

On Myrmidons and cry you all amain

Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain

Hark A retire upon our Grecian part

The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the Earth

And stickler-like the armies separates

My half-supped sword that frankly would have fed

Pleased with this dainty bait thus goes to bed

Come tie his body to my horse's tail

Along the field I will the Trojan trail
