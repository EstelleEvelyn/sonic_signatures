


Let's raise the siege Why live we idly here

Talbot is taken whom we wont to fear

Remaineth none but mad-brained Salisbury

And he may well in fretting spend his gall

Nor men nor money hath he to make war

Salisbury is a desperate homicide

He fighteth as one weary of his life

The other lords like lions wanting food

Do rush upon us as their hungry prey

I think by some odd gimmers or device

Their arms are set like clocks still to strike on

Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do

By my consent we'll even let them alone

Fair maid is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats

She takes upon her bravely at first dash

My lord methinks is very long in talk

Shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean

My lord where are you What devise you on

Shall we give o'er Orleance or no

Woman do what thou canst to save our honors

Drive them from Orleance and be immortalized

Why ring not bells aloud throughout the town

Dauphin command the citizens make bonfires

And feast and banquet in the open streets

To celebrate the joy that God hath given us

'Twas time I trow to wake and leave our beds

Hearing alarums at our chamber doors

If not of hell the heavens sure favor him

And so was mine my lord

By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower

Which once discerned shows that her meaning is

No way to that for weakness which she entered

Defer no time delays have dangerous ends

Enter and cry The Dauphin presently

And then do execution on the watch

To whom

Suffolk what remedy

I am a soldier and unapt to weep

Or to exclaim on Fortune's fickleness

Speaks Suffolk as he thinks

Upon thy princely warrant I descend

To give thee answer of thy just demand

Welcome brave earl into our territories

Command in Anjou what your Honor pleases

Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth

To be the princely bride of such a lord

Upon condition I may quietly

Enjoy mine own the country Maine and Anjou

Free from oppression or the stroke of war

My daughter shall be Henry's if he please

And I again in Henry's royal name

As deputy unto that gracious king

Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith

I do embrace thee as I would embrace

The Christian prince King Henry were he here

My lord you do not well in obstinacy

To cavil in the course of this contract

If once it be neglected ten to one

We shall not find like opportunity
