


Noble patricians, patrons of my right,

Defend the justice of my cause with arms.

And countrymen, my loving followers,

Plead my successive title with your swords.

I am his firstborn son that was the last

That wore the imperial diadem of Rome.

Then let my father’s honors live in me,

Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.

How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!

Friends that have been thus forward in my right,

I thank you all and here dismiss you all,

And to the love and favor of my country

Commit myself, my person, and the cause.

Rome, be as just and gracious unto me

As I am confident and kind to thee.

Open the gates and let me in.

Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?

Romans, do me right.

Patricians, draw your swords and sheathe them not

Till Saturninus be Rome’s emperor.—

Andronicus, would thou were shipped to hell

Rather than rob me of the people’s hearts.

Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done

To us in our election this day,

I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,

And will with deeds requite thy gentleness.

And for an onset, Titus, to advance

Thy name and honorable family,

Lavinia will I make my empress,

Rome’s royal mistress, mistress of my heart,

And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.

Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?

Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.

How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts

Rome shall record.—And when I do forget

The least of these unspeakable deserts,

Romans, forget your fealty to me.

A goodly lady, trust me, of the hue

That I would choose, were I to choose anew.—

Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance.

Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,

Thou com’st not to be made a scorn in Rome.

Princely shall be thy usage every way.

Rest on my word, and let not discontent

Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you

Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.—

Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?

Thanks, sweet Lavinia.—Romans, let us go.

Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.

Proclaim our honors, lords, with trump and drum.

Surprised? By whom?

No, Titus, no, the Emperor needs her not,

Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock.

I’ll trust by leisure him that mocks me once,

Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,

Confederates all thus to dishonor me.

Was none in Rome to make a stale

But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,

Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine

That said’st I begged the empire at thy hands.

But go thy ways. Go give that changing piece

To him that flourished for her with his sword.

A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy,

One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,

To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.

And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,

That like the stately Phoebe ’mongst her nymphs

Dost overshine the gallant’st dames of Rome,

If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,

Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,

And will create thee Emperess of Rome.

Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?

And here I swear by all the Roman gods,

Sith priest and holy water are so near,

And tapers burn so bright, and everything

In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,

I will not resalute the streets of Rome

Or climb my palace till from forth this place

I lead espoused my bride along with me.

Ascend, fair queen, to Pantheon.—Lords, accompany

Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,

Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,

Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquerèd.

There shall we consummate our spousal rites.

So, Bassianus, you have played your prize.

God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride.

Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,

Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.

’Tis good, sir, you are very short with us.

But if we live, we’ll be as sharp with you.

What, madam, be dishonored openly,

And basely put it up without revenge?

Rise, Titus, rise. My empress hath prevailed.

Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.

Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother’s here,

And at my lovely Tamora’s entreats,

I do remit these young men’s heinous faults.

Stand up.

Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,

I found a friend, and sure as death I swore

I would not part a bachelor from the priest.

Come, if the Emperor’s court can feast two brides,

You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.—

This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.

Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.

And you have rung it lustily, my lords—

Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.

Come on, then. Horse and chariots let us have,

And to our sport. Madam, now shall you see

Our Roman hunting.

Along with me! I’ll see what hole is here

And what he is that now is leapt into it.—

Say, who art thou that lately didst descend

Into this gaping hollow of the earth?

My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest.

He and his lady both are at the lodge

Upon the north side of this pleasant chase.

’Tis not an hour since I left them there.

Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.

Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound.

Poor Bassianus here lies murderèd.

An if we miss to meet him handsomely,

Sweet huntsman—Bassianus ’tis we mean—

Do thou so much as dig the grave for him;

Thou know’st our meaning. Look for thy reward

Among the nettles at the elder tree

Which overshades the mouth of that same pit

Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.

Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.

O Tamora, was ever heard the like?

This is the pit, and this the elder tree.—

Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out

That should have murdered Bassianus here.

Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,

Have here bereft my brother of his life.—

Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison.

There let them bide until we have devised

Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.

If it be proved! You see it is apparent.

Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?

Thou shalt not bail them. See thou follow me.—

Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers.

Let them not speak a word. The guilt is plain.

For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,

That end upon them should be executed.

Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen

An emperor in Rome thus overborne,

Troubled, confronted thus, and for the extent

Of equal justice, used in such contempt?

My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,

However these disturbers of our peace

Buzz in the people’s ears, there naught hath passed

But even with law against the willful sons

Of old Andronicus. And what an if

His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits?

Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,

His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?

And now he writes to heaven for his redress!

See, here’s “to Jove,” and this “to Mercury,”

This “to Apollo,” this to the god of war.

Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!

What’s this but libeling against the Senate

And blazoning our unjustice everywhere?

A goodly humor is it not, my lords?

As who would say, in Rome no justice were.

But if I live, his feignèd ecstasies

Shall be no shelter to these outrages,

But he and his shall know that justice lives

In Saturninus’ health, whom, if he sleep,

He’ll so awake as he in fury shall

Cut off the proud’st conspirator that lives.

Go, take him away, and hang him presently.

Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!

Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?

I know from whence this same device proceeds.

May this be borne?—as if his traitorous sons,

That died by law for murder of our brother,

Have by my means been butchered wrongfully!

Go, drag the villain hither by the hair.

Nor age nor honor shall shape privilege.

For this proud mock, I’ll be thy slaughterman,

Sly, frantic wretch, that holp’st to make me great

In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

What news with thee, Aemilius?

Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?

These tidings nip me, and I hang the head

As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms.

Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.

’Tis he the common people love so much.

Myself hath often heard them say,

When I have walkèd like a private man,

That Lucius’ banishment was wrongfully,

And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.

Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius

And will revolt from me to succor him.

But he will not entreat his son for us.

Aemilius, do this message honorably,

And if he stand in hostage for his safety,

Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.

Then go successantly, and plead to him.

What, hath the firmament more suns than one?

Marcus, we will.

Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?

It was, Andronicus.

Because the girl should not survive her shame,

And by her presence still renew his sorrows.

What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?

What, was she ravished? Tell who did the deed.

Go fetch them hither to us presently.

Die, frantic wretch, for this accursèd deed.
