


Ill met by moonlight proud Titania

Tarry rash wanton Am not I thy lord

How canst thou thus for shame Titania

Glance at my credit with Hippolyta

Knowing I know thy love to Theseus

Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night

From Perigouna whom he ravishd

And make him with fair Aegles break his faith

With Ariadne and Antiopa

Do you amend it then It lies in you

Why should Titania cross her Oberon

I do but beg a little changeling boy

To be my henchman

How long within this wood intend you stay

Give me that boy and I will go with thee

Well go thy way Thou shalt not from this grove

Till I torment thee for this injury

My gentle Puck come hither Thou rememb'rest

Since once I sat upon a promontory

And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back

Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath

That the rude sea grew civil at her song

And certain stars shot madly from their spheres

To hear the sea-maid's music

That very time I saw but thou couldst not

Flying between the cold moon and the Earth

Cupid all armed A certain aim he took

At a fair vestal thrond by the west

And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow

As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts

But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft

Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon

And the imperial vot'ress passd on

In maiden meditation fancy-free

Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell

It fell upon a little western flower

Before milk-white now purple with love's wound

And maidens call it love-in-idleness

Fetch me that flower the herb I showed thee once

The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid

Will make or man or woman madly dote

Upon the next live creature that it sees

Fetch me this herb and be thou here again

Ere the leviathan can swim a league

Having once this juice

I'll watch Titania when she is asleep

And drop the liquor of it in her eyes

The next thing then she waking looks upon

Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull

On meddling monkey or on busy ape

She shall pursue it with the soul of love

And ere I take this charm from off her sight

As I can take it with another herb

I'll make her render up her page to me

But who comes here I am invisible

And I will overhear their conference

Fare thee well nymph Ere he do leave this grove

Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love

Hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer

I pray thee give it me

I know a bank where the wild thyme blows

Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows

Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine

With sweet muskroses and with eglantine

There sleeps Titania sometime of the night

Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight

And there the snake throws her enameled skin

Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in

And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes

And make her full of hateful fantasies

Take thou some of it and seek through this grove

A sweet Athenian lady is in love

With a disdainful youth Anoint his eyes

But do it when the next thing he espies

May be the lady Thou shalt know the man

By the Athenian garments he hath on

Effect it with some care that he may prove

More fond on her than she upon her love

And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow

What thou seest when thou dost wake

Do it for thy true love take

Love and languish for his sake

Be it ounce or cat or bear

Pard or boar with bristled hair

In thy eye that shall appear

When thou wak'st it is thy dear

Wake when some vile thing is near

I wonder if Titania be awaked

Then what it was that next came in her eye

Which she must dote on in extremity

Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit

What night-rule now about this haunted grove

This falls out better than I could devise

But hast thou yet latched the Athenian's eyes

With the love juice as I did bid thee do

Stand close This is the same Athenian

What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite

And laid the love juice on some true-love's sight

Of thy misprision must perforce ensue

Some true-love turned and not a false turned true

About the wood go swifter than the wind

And Helena of Athens look thou find

All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer

With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear

By some illusion see thou bring her here

I'll charm his eyes against she do appear

Flower of this purple dye

Hit with Cupid's archery

Sink in apple of his eye

When his love he doth espy

Let her shine as gloriously

As the Venus of the sky

When thou wak'st if she be by

Beg of her for remedy

Stand aside The noise they make

Will cause Demetrius to awake

This is thy negligence Still thou mistak'st

Or else committ'st thy knaveries willfully

Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight

Hie therefore Robin overcast the night

The starry welkin cover thou anon

With drooping fog as black as Acheron

And lead these testy rivals so astray

As one come not within another's way

Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue

Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong

And sometime rail thou like Demetrius

And from each other look thou lead them thus

Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep

With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep

Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye

Whose liquor hath this virtuous property

To take from thence all error with his might

And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight

When they next wake all this derision

Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision

And back to Athens shall the lovers wend

With league whose date till death shall never end

Whiles I in this affair do thee employ

I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy

And then I will her charmd eye release

From monster's view and all things shall be peace

But we are spirits of another sort

I with the Morning's love have oft made sport

And like a forester the groves may tread

Even till the eastern gate all fiery red

Opening on Neptune with fair blessd beams

Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams

But notwithstanding haste Make no delay

We may effect this business yet ere day

Welcome good Robin Seest thou this sweet sight

Her dotage now I do begin to pity

For meeting her of late behind the wood

Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool

I did upbraid her and fall out with her

For she his hairy temples then had rounded

With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers

And that same dew which sometime on the buds

Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls

Stood now within the pretty flouriets' eyes

Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail

When I had at my pleasure taunted her

And she in mild terms begged my patience

I then did ask of her her changeling child

Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent

To bear him to my bower in Fairyland

And now I have the boy I will undo

This hateful imperfection of her eyes

And gentle Puck take this transformd scalp

From off the head of this Athenian swain

That he awaking when the other do

May all to Athens back again repair

And think no more of this night's accidents

But as the fierce vexation of a dream

But first I will release the Fairy Queen

Be as thou wast wont to be

See as thou wast wont to see

Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower

Hath such force and blessd power

Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen

There lies your love

Silence awhileRobin take off this head

Titania music call and strike more dead

Than common sleep of all these five the sense

Sound music Come my queen take hands with me

And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be

Now thou and I are new in amity

And will tomorrow midnight solemnly

Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly

And bless it to all fair prosperity

There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be

Wedded with Theseus all in jollity

Then my queen in silence sad

Trip we after night's shade

We the globe can compass soon

Swifter than the wand'ring moon

Through the house give glimmering light

By the dead and drowsy fire

Every elf and fairy sprite

Hop as light as bird from brier

And this ditty after me

Sing and dance it trippingly

Now until the break of day

Through this house each fairy stray

To the best bride-bed will we

Which by us shall blessd be

And the issue there create

Ever shall be fortunate

So shall all the couples three

Ever true in loving be

And the blots of Nature's hand

Shall not in their issue stand

Never mole harelip nor scar

Nor mark prodigious such as are

Despisd in nativity

Shall upon their children be

With this field-dew consecrate

Every fairy take his gait

And each several chamber bless

Through this palace with sweet peace

And the owner of it blest

Ever shall in safety rest

Trip away Make no stay

Meet me all by break of day
