


I thank you I am not of many words but I

thank you

There is no measure in the occasion that

breeds Therefore the sadness is without limit

And when I have heard it what blessing

brings it

I wonder that thou being as thou sayst thou

art born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral

medicine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide

what I am I must be sad when I have cause and

smile at no man's jests eat when I have stomach

and wait for no man's leisure sleep when I am

drowsy and tend on no man's business laugh when

I am merry and claw no man in his humor

I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a

rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be

disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob

love from any In this though I cannot be said to be

a flattering honest man it must not be denied but I

am a plain-dealing villain I am trusted with a

muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I

have decreed not to sing in my cage If I had my

mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I would do

my liking In the meantime let me be that I am and

seek not to alter me

I make all use of it for I use it only Who

comes here

What news Borachio

Will it serve for any model to build mischief

on What is he for a fool that betroths himself to

unquietness

Who the most exquisite Claudio

A proper squire And who and who Which

way looks he

A very forward March chick How came you

to this

Come come let us thither This may prove

food to my displeasure That young start-up hath

all the glory of my overthrow If I can cross him any

way I bless myself every way You are both sure and

will assist me

Let us to the great supper Their cheer is the

greater that I am subdued Would the cook were o'

my mind Shall we go prove what's to be done

Sure my brother is amorous

on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break

with him about it The ladies follow her and but one

visor remains

Are not you Signior Benedick

Signior you are very near my brother in his

love He is enamored on Hero I pray you dissuade

him from her She is no equal for his birth You

may do the part of an honest man in it

I heard him swear his affection

Come let us to the banquet

It is so The Count Claudio shall marry the

daughter of Leonato

Any bar any cross any impediment will be

med'cinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him

and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges

evenly with mine How canst thou cross this

marriage

Show me briefly how

I remember

What life is in that to be the death of this

marriage

What proof shall I make of that

Only to despite them I will endeavor

anything

Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will

put it in practice Be cunning in the working this

and thy fee is a thousand ducats

I will presently go learn their day of

marriage

My lord and brother God save you

If your leisure served I would speak with

you

If it please you Yet Count Claudio may

hear for what I would speak of concerns him

Means your Lordship to be

married tomorrow

I know not that when he knows what I

know

You may think I love you not Let that

appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I

now will manifest For my brother I think he holds

you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect

your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and

labor ill bestowed

I came hither to tell you and circumstances

shortened for she has been too long

a-talking of the lady is disloyal

Even she Leonato's Hero your Hero every

man's Hero

The word is too good to paint out her

wickedness I could say she were worse Think you

of a worse title and I will fit her to it Wonder not

till further warrant Go but with me tonight you

shall see her chamber window entered even the

night before her wedding day If you love her then

tomorrow wed her But it would better fit your

honor to change your mind

If you dare not trust that you see confess

not that you know If you will follow me I will

show you enough and when you have seen more

and heard more proceed accordingly

I will disparage her no farther till you are

my witnesses Bear it coldly but till midnight and

let the issue show itself

O plague right well prevented So will you

say when you have seen the sequel

Sir they are spoken and these things are true

Fie fie they are not to be named my lord

Not to be spoke of

There is not chastity enough in language

Without offense to utter themThus pretty lady

I am sorry for thy much misgovernment

Come let us go These things come thus to light

Smother her spirits up
