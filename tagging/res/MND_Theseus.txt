


Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour

Draws on apace Four happy days bring in

Another moon But O methinks how slow

This old moon wanes She lingers my desires

Like to a stepdame or a dowager

Long withering out a young man's revenue

Go Philostrate

Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments

Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth

Turn melancholy forth to funerals

The pale companion is not for our pomp

Hippolyta I wooed thee with my sword

And won thy love doing thee injuries

But I will wed thee in another key

With pomp with triumph and with reveling

Thanks good Egeus What's the news with thee

What say you Hermia Be advised fair maid

To you your father should be as a god

One that composed your beauties yea and one

To whom you are but as a form in wax

By him imprinted and within his power

To leave the figure or disfigure it

Demetrius is a worthy gentleman

In himself he is

But in this kind wanting your father's voice

The other must be held the worthier

Rather your eyes must with his judgment look

Either to die the death or to abjure

Forever the society of men

Therefore fair Hermia question your desires

Know of your youth examine well your blood

Whether if you yield not to your father's choice

You can endure the livery of a nun

For aye to be in shady cloister mewed

To live a barren sister all your life

Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon

Thrice-blessd they that master so their blood

To undergo such maiden pilgrimage

But earthlier happy is the rose distilled

Than that which withering on the virgin thorn

Grows lives and dies in single blessedness

Take time to pause and by the next new moon

The sealing day betwixt my love and me

For everlasting bond of fellowship

Upon that day either prepare to die

For disobedience to your father's will

Or else to wed Demetrius as he would

Or on Diana's altar to protest

For aye austerity and single life

I must confess that I have heard so much

And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof

But being overfull of self-affairs

My mind did lose itBut Demetrius come

And come Egeus you shall go with me

I have some private schooling for you both

For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself

To fit your fancies to your father's will

Or else the law of Athens yields you up

Which by no means we may extenuate

To death or to a vow of single life

Come my Hippolyta What cheer my love

Demetrius and Egeus go along

I must employ you in some business

Against our nuptial and confer with you

Of something nearly that concerns yourselves

Go one of you find out the Forester

For now our observation is performed

And since we have the vaward of the day

My love shall hear the music of my hounds

Uncouple in the western valley let them go

Dispatch I say and find the Forester

We will fair queen up to the mountain's top

And mark the musical confusion

Of hounds and echo in conjunction

My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind

So flewed so sanded and their heads are hung

With ears that sweep away the morning dew

Crook-kneed and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls

Slow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bells

Each under each A cry more tunable

Was never holloed to nor cheered with horn

In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly

Judge when you hearBut soft What nymphs are these

No doubt they rose up early to observe

The rite of May and hearing our intent

Came here in grace of our solemnity

But speak Egeus Is not this the day

That Hermia should give answer of her choice

Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns

Good morrow friends Saint Valentine is past

Begin these woodbirds but to couple now

I pray you all stand up

I know you two are rival enemies

How comes this gentle concord in the world

That hatred is so far from jealousy

To sleep by hate and fear no enmity

Fair lovers you are fortunately met

Of this discourse we more will hear anon

Egeus I will overbear your will

For in the temple by and by with us

These couples shall eternally be knit

And for the morning now is something worn

Our purposed hunting shall be set aside

Away with us to Athens Three and three

We'll hold a feast in great solemnity

Come Hippolyta

More strange than true I never may believe

These antique fables nor these fairy toys

Lovers and madmen have such seething brains

Such shaping fantasies that apprehend

More than cool reason ever comprehends

The lunatic the lover and the poet

Are of imagination all compact

One sees more devils than vast hell can hold

That is the madman The lover all as frantic

Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt

The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling

Doth glance from heaven to Earth from Earth to heaven

And as imagination bodies forth

The forms of things unknown the poet's pen

Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing

A local habitation and a name

Such tricks hath strong imagination

That if it would but apprehend some joy

It comprehends some bringer of that joy

Or in the night imagining some fear

How easy is a bush supposed a bear

Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth

Joy gentle friends Joy and fresh days of love

Accompany your hearts

Come now what masques what dances shall we have

To wear away this long age of three hours

Between our after-supper and bedtime

Where is our usual manager of mirth

What revels are in hand Is there no play

To ease the anguish of a torturing hour

Call Philostrate

Say what abridgment have you for this evening

What masque what music How shall we beguile

The lazy time if not with some delight

The battle with the Centaurs to be sung

By an Athenian eunuch to the harp

We'll none of that That have I told my love

In glory of my kinsman Hercules

The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals

Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage

That is an old device and it was played

When I from Thebes came last a conqueror

The thrice-three Muses mourning for the death

Of learning late deceased in beggary

That is some satire keen and critical

Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony

A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus

And his love Thisbe very tragical mirth

Merry and tragical Tedious and brief

That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow

How shall we find the concord of this discord

What are they that do play it

And we will hear it

I will hear that play

For never anything can be amiss

When simpleness and duty tender it

Go bring them inand take your places ladies

Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing

The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing

Our sport shall be to take what they mistake

And what poor duty cannot do noble respect

Takes it in might not merit

Where I have come great clerks have purposd

To greet me with premeditated welcomes

Where I have seen them shiver and look pale

Make periods in the midst of sentences

Throttle their practiced accent in their fears

And in conclusion dumbly have broke off

Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet

Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome

And in the modesty of fearful duty

I read as much as from the rattling tongue

Of saucy and audacious eloquence

Love therefore and tongue-tied simplicity

In least speak most to my capacity

Let him approach

This fellow doth not stand upon points

His speech was like a tangled chainnothing

impaired but all disordered Who is next

I wonder if the lion be to speak

Would you desire lime and hair to speak

better

Pyramus draws near the wall Silence

The wall methinks being sensible should

curse again

Now is the wall down between the two

neighbors

The best in this kind are but shadows and

the worst are no worse if imagination amend

them

If we imagine no worse of them than they of

themselves they may pass for excellent men Here

come two noble beasts in a man and a lion

A very gentle beast and of a good

conscience

True and a goose for his discretion

His discretion I am sure cannot carry his

valor for the goose carries not the fox It is well

Leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the

Moon

He is no crescent and his horns are invisible

within the circumference

This is the greatest error of all the rest the

man should be put into the lanthorn How is it else

the man i' th' moon

It appears by his small light of discretion that

he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason

we must stay the time

Well run Thisbe

Well moused Lion

This passion and the death of a dear friend

would go near to make a man look sad

With the help of a surgeon he might yet

recover and yet prove an ass

She will find him by starlight

Here she comes and her passion ends the play

Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the

dead

No epilogue I pray you For your play needs

no excuse Never excuse For when the players are

all dead there need none to be blamed Marry if

he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged

himself in Thisbe's garter it would have been a fine

tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged

But come your Bergomask Let your

epilogue alone

The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve

Lovers to bed 'Tis almost fairy time

I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn

As much as we this night have overwatched

This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled

The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed

A fortnight hold we this solemnity

In nightly revels and new jollity
