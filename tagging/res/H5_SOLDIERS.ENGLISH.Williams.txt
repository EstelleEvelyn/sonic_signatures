I think we shall never see the end of it.—Who goes

there?

Under what captain serve you?

A good old commander and a most kind

gentleman. I pray you, what thinks he of our

estate?

That’s more than we know.

But if the cause be not good, the King

himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all

those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a

battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry

all “We died at such a place,” some swearing, some

crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left

poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe,

some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard

there are few die well that die in a battle, for how

can they charitably dispose of anything when blood

is their argument? Now, if these men do not die

well, it will be a black matter for the king that led

them to it, who to disobey were against all proportion

of subjection.

’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill

upon his own head; the King is not to answer it.

Ay, he said so to make us fight cheerfully,

but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed

and we ne’er the wiser.

You pay him then. That’s a perilous shot out

of an elder gun, that a poor and a private displeasure

can do against a monarch. You may as well go

about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face

with a peacock’s feather. You’ll “never trust his

word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.

Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.

How shall I know thee again?

Here’s my glove. Give me another of thine.

This will I also wear in my cap. If ever thou

come to me and say, after tomorrow, “This is my

glove,” by this hand I will take thee a box on the

ear.

Thou dar’st as well be hanged.

Keep thy word. Fare thee well.

An ’t please your Majesty, ’tis the gage of

one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.

An ’t please your Majesty, a rascal that

swaggered with me last night, who, if alive and ever

dare to challenge this glove, I have sworn to take

him a box o’ th’ ear, or if I can see my glove in his

cap, which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would

wear if alive, I will strike it out soundly.

So I will, my liege, as I live.

Under Captain Gower, my liege.

I will, my liege.

I warrant it is to knight you, captain.

Sir, know you this glove?

I know this, and thus I challenge it.

Do you think I’ll be forsworn?

I am no traitor.

My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow

of it. And he that I gave it to in change promised to

wear it in his cap. I promised to strike him if he did.

I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have

been as good as my word.

All offenses, my lord, come from the heart.

Never came any from mine that might offend your

Majesty.

Your Majesty came not like yourself. You

appeared to me but as a common man; witness the

night, your garments, your lowliness. And what

your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech

you take it for your own fault and not mine, for, had

you been as I took you for, I made no offense.

Therefore, I beseech your Highness pardon me.

I will none of your money.
