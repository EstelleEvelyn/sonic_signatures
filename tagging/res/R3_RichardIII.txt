


Now is the winter of our discontent

Made glorious summer by this son of York

And all the clouds that loured upon our house

In the deep bosom of the ocean buried

Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths

Our bruisd arms hung up for monuments

Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings

Our dreadful marches to delightful measures

Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front

And now instead of mounting barbd steeds

To fright the souls of fearful adversaries

He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber

To the lascivious pleasing of a lute

But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks

Nor made to court an amorous looking glass

I that am rudely stamped and want love's majesty

To strut before a wanton ambling nymph

I that am curtailed of this fair proportion

Cheated of feature by dissembling nature

Deformed unfinished sent before my time

Into this breathing world scarce half made up

And that so lamely and unfashionable

That dogs bark at me as I halt by them

Why I in this weak piping time of peace

Have no delight to pass away the time

Unless to see my shadow in the sun

And descant on mine own deformity

And therefore since I cannot prove a lover

To entertain these fair well-spoken days

I am determind to prove a villain

And hate the idle pleasures of these days

Plots have I laid inductions dangerous

By drunken prophecies libels and dreams

To set my brother Clarence and the King

In deadly hate the one against the other

And if King Edward be as true and just

As I am subtle false and treacherous

This day should Clarence closely be mewed up

About a prophecy which says that G

Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be

Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes

Brother good day What means this armd guard

That waits upon your Grace

Upon what cause

Alack my lord that fault is none of yours

He should for that commit your godfathers

O belike his Majesty hath some intent

That you should be new christened in the Tower

But what's the matter Clarence May I know

Why this it is when men are ruled by women

'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower

My Lady Grey his wife Clarence 'tis she

That tempers him to this extremity

Was it not she and that good man of worship

Anthony Woodeville her brother there

That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower

From whence this present day he is delivered

We are not safe Clarence we are not safe

Humbly complaining to her Deity

Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty

I'll tell you what I think it is our way

If we will keep in favor with the King

To be her men and wear her livery

The jealous o'erworn widow and herself

Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen

Are mighty gossips in our monarchy

Even so An please your Worship Brakenbury

You may partake of anything we say

We speak no treason man We say the King

Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen

Well struck in years fair and not jealous

We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot

A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue

And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks

How say you sir Can you deny all this

Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee fellow

He that doth naught with her excepting one

Were best to do it secretly alone

We are the Queen's abjects and must obey

Brother farewell I will unto the King

And whatsoe'er you will employ me in

Were it to call King Edward's widow sister

I will perform it to enfranchise you

Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood

Touches me deeper than you can imagine

Well your imprisonment shall not be long

I will deliver you or else lie for you

Meantime have patience

Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return

Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so

That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven

If heaven will take the present at our hands

But who comes here The new-delivered Hastings

As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain

Well are you welcome to the open air

How hath your Lordship brooked imprisonment

No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too

For they that were your enemies are his

And have prevailed as much on him as you

What news abroad

Now by Saint John that news is bad indeed

O he hath kept an evil diet long

And overmuch consumed his royal person

'Tis very grievous to be thought upon

Where is he in his bed

Go you before and I will follow you

He cannot live I hope and must not die

Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven

I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence

With lies well steeled with weighty arguments

And if I fail not in my deep intent

Clarence hath not another day to live

Which done God take King Edward to His mercy

And leave the world for me to bustle in

For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter

What though I killed her husband and her father

The readiest way to make the wench amends

Is to become her husband and her father

The which will I not all so much for love

As for another secret close intent

By marrying her which I must reach unto

But yet I run before my horse to market

Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns

When they are gone then must I count my gains

Stay you that bear the corse and set it down

Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul

I'll make a corse of him that disobeys

Unmannered dog stand thou when I command

Advance thy halberd higher than my breast

Or by Saint Paul I'll strike thee to my foot

And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness

Sweet saint for charity be not so curst

Lady you know no rules of charity

Which renders good for bad blessings for curses

But I know none and therefore am no beast

More wonderful when angels are so angry

Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman

Of these supposd crimes to give me leave

By circumstance but to acquit myself

Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have

Some patient leisure to excuse myself

By such despair I should accuse myself

Say that I slew them not

I did not kill your husband

Nay he is dead and slain by Edward's hands

I was provokd by her sland'rous tongue

That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders

I grant you

The better for the King of heaven that hath him

Let him thank me that holp to send him thither

For he was fitter for that place than Earth

Yes one place else if you will hear me name it

Your bedchamber

So will it madam till I lie with you

I know so But gentle Lady Anne

To leave this keen encounter of our wits

And fall something into a slower method

Is not the causer of the timeless deaths

Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward

As blameful as the executioner

Your beauty was the cause of that effect

Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep

To undertake the death of all the world

So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom

These eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack

You should not blemish it if I stood by

As all the world is cheerd by the sun

So I by that It is my day my life

Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both

It is a quarrel most unnatural

To be revenged on him that loveth thee

He that bereft thee lady of thy husband

Did it to help thee to a better husband

He lives that loves thee better than he could

Plantagenet

The selfsame name but one of better nature

Here Why dost thou spit at me

Never came poison from so sweet a place

Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine

I would they were that I might die at once

For now they kill me with a living death

Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears

Shamed their aspects with store of childish drops

These eyes which never shed remorseful tear

No when my father York and Edward wept

To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made

When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him

Nor when thy warlike father like a child

Told the sad story of my father's death

And twenty times made pause to sob and weep

That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks

Like trees bedashed with rainin that sad time

My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear

And what these sorrows could not thence exhale

Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping

I never sued to friend nor enemy

My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word

But now thy beauty is proposed my fee

My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak

Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made

For kissing lady not for such contempt

If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive

Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword

Which if thou please to hide in this true breast

And let the soul forth that adoreth thee

I lay it naked to the deadly stroke

And humbly beg the death upon my knee

Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry

But 'twas thy beauty that provokd me

Nay now dispatch 'twas I that stabbed young Edward

But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on

Take up the sword again or take up me

Then bid me kill myself and I will do it

That was in thy rage

Speak it again and even with the word

This hand which for thy love did kill thy love

Shall for thy love kill a far truer love

To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory

'Tis figured in my tongue

Then never was man true

Say then my peace is made

But shall I live in hope

Vouchsafe to wear this ring

Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger

Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart

Wear both of them for both of them are thine

And if thy poor devoted servant may

But beg one favor at thy gracious hand

Thou dost confirm his happiness forever

That it may please you leave these sad designs

To him that hath most cause to be a mourner

And presently repair to Crosby House

Where after I have solemnly interred

At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king

And wet his grave with my repentant tears

I will with all expedient duty see you

For divers unknown reasons I beseech you

Grant me this boon

Bid me farewell

No to Whitefriars There attend my coming

Was ever woman in this humor wooed

Was ever woman in this humor won

I'll have her but I will not keep her long

What I that killed her husband and his father

To take her in her heart's extremest hate

With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes

The bleeding witness of my hatred by

Having God her conscience and these bars against me

And I no friends to back my suit at all

But the plain devil and dissembling looks

And yet to win her all the world to nothing

Ha

Hath she forgot already that brave prince

Edward her lord whom I some three months since

Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury

A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman

Framed in the prodigality of nature

Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal

The spacious world cannot again afford

And will she yet abase her eyes on me

That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince

And made her widow to a woeful bed

On me whose all not equals Edward's moiety

On me that halts and am misshapen thus

My dukedom to a beggarly denier

I do mistake my person all this while

Upon my life she finds although I cannot

Myself to be a marv'lous proper man

I'll be at charges for a looking glass

And entertain a score or two of tailors

To study fashions to adorn my body

Since I am crept in favor with myself

I will maintain it with some little cost

But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave

And then return lamenting to my love

Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass

That I may see my shadow as I pass

They do me wrong and I will not endure it

Who is it that complains unto the King

That I forsooth am stern and love them not

By holy Paul they love his Grace but lightly

That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors

Because I cannot flatter and look fair

Smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog

Duck with French nods and apish courtesy

I must be held a rancorous enemy

Cannot a plain man live and think no harm

But thus his simple truth must be abused

With silken sly insinuating Jacks

To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace

When have I injured thee When done thee wrong

Or theeOr thee Or any of your faction

A plague upon you all His royal Grace

Whom God preserve better than you would wish

Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while

But you must trouble him with lewd complaints

I cannot tell The world is grown so bad

That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch

Since every Jack became a gentleman

There's many a gentle person made a Jack

Meantime God grants that we have need of you

Our brother is imprisoned by your means

Myself disgraced and the nobility

Held in contempt while great promotions

Are daily given to ennoble those

That scarce some two days since were worth a noble

You may deny that you were not the mean

Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment

She may Lord Rivers Why who knows not so

She may do more sir than denying that

She may help you to many fair preferments

And then deny her aiding hand therein

And lay those honors on your high desert

What may she not She may ay marry may she

What marry may she Marry with a king

A bachelor and a handsome stripling too

Iwis your grandam had a worser match

What threat you me with telling of the King

Tell him and spare not Look what I have said

I will avouch 't in presence of the King

I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tower

'Tis time to speak My pains are quite forgot

Ere you were queen ay or your husband king

I was a packhorse in his great affairs

A weeder-out of his proud adversaries

A liberal rewarder of his friends

To royalize his blood I spent mine own

In all which time you and your husband Grey

Were factious for the House of Lancaster

And Rivers so were youWas not your husband

In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain

Let me put in your minds if you forget

What you have been ere this and what you are

Withal what I have been and what I am

Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick

Ay and forswore himselfwhich Jesu pardon

To fight on Edward's party for the crown

And for his meed poor lord he is mewed up

I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's

Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine

I am too childish-foolish for this world

If I should be I had rather be a peddler

Far be it from my heart the thought thereof

Foul wrinkled witch what mak'st thou in my sight

Wert thou not banishd on pain of death

The curse my noble father laid on thee

When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper

And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes

And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout

Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland

His curses then from bitterness of soul

Denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee

And God not we hath plagued thy bloody deed

Have done thy charm thou hateful withered hag

Margaret

Ha

I cry thee mercy then for I did think

That thou hadst called me all these bitter names

'Tis done by me and ends in Margaret

Good counsel marryLearn it learn it marquess

Ay and much more but I was born so high

Our aerie buildeth in the cedar's top

And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun

What doth she say my lord of Buckingham

I cannot blame her By God's holy mother

She hath had too much wrong and I repent

My part thereof that I have done to her

Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong

I was too hot to do somebody good

That is too cold in thinking of it now

Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid

He is franked up to fatting for his pains

God pardon them that are the cause thereof

So do I everbeing well advised

For had I cursed now I had cursed myself

I do the wrong and first begin to brawl

The secret mischiefs that I set abroach

I lay unto the grievous charge of others

Clarence who I indeed have cast in darkness

I do beweep to many simple gulls

Namely to Derby Hastings Buckingham

And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies

That stir the King against the Duke my brother

Now they believe it and withal whet me

To be revenged on Rivers Dorset Grey

But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture

Tell them that God bids us do good for evil

And thus I clothe my naked villainy

With odd old ends stol'n forth of Holy Writ

And seem a saint when most I play the devil

But soft here come my executioners

How now my hardy stout resolvd mates

Are you now going to dispatch this thing

Well thought upon I have it here about me

When you have done repair to Crosby Place

But sirs be sudden in the execution

Withal obdurate do not hear him plead

For Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps

May move your hearts to pity if you mark him

Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears

I like you lads About your business straight

Go go dispatch

Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen

And princely peers a happy time of day

A blessd labor my most sovereign lord

Among this princely heap if any here

By false intelligence or wrong surmise

Hold me a foe

If I unwittingly or in my rage

Have aught committed that is hardly borne

By any in this presence I desire

To reconcile me to his friendly peace

'Tis death to me to be at enmity

I hate it and desire all good men's love

First madam I entreat true peace of you

Which I will purchase with my duteous service

Of you my noble cousin Buckingham

If ever any grudge were lodged between us

Of you and you Lord Rivers and of Dorset

That all without desert have frowned on me

Of you Lord Woodeville and Lord Scalesof you

Dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all

I do not know that Englishman alive

With whom my soul is any jot at odds

More than the infant that is born tonight

I thank my God for my humility

Why madam have I offered love for this

To be so flouted in this royal presence

Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead

You do him injury to scorn his corse

But he poor man by your first order died

And that a wingd Mercury did bear

Some tardy cripple bare the countermand

That came too lag to see him burid

God grant that some less noble and less loyal

Nearer in bloody thoughts and not in blood

Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did

And yet go current from suspicion

This is the fruits of rashness Marked you not

How that the guilty kindred of the Queen

Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death

O they did urge it still unto the King

God will revenge it Come lords will you go

To comfort Edward with our company

Sister have comfort All of us have cause

To wail the dimming of our shining star

But none can help our harms by wailing them

Madam my mother I do cry you mercy

I did not see your Grace Humbly on my knee

I crave your blessing

Amen And make me die a good old man

That is the butt end of a mother's blessing

I marvel that her Grace did leave it out

I hope the King made peace with all of us

And the compact is firm and true in me

Then be it so and go we to determine

Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow

Madam and you my sister will you go

To give your censures in this business

My other self my council's consistory

My oracle my prophet my dear cousin

I as a child will go by thy direction

Toward Ludlow then for we'll not stay behind

Welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign

The weary way hath made you melancholy

Sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years

Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit

Nor more can you distinguish of a man

Than of his outward show which God He knows

Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart

Those uncles which you want were dangerous

Your Grace attended to their sugared words

But looked not on the poison of their hearts

God keep you from them and from such false friends

My lord the Mayor of London comes to greet you

Where it seems best unto your royal self

If I may counsel you some day or two

Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower

Then where you please and shall be thought most fit

For your best health and recreation

So wise so young they say do never live long

I say without characters fame lives long

Thus like the formal Vice Iniquity

I moralize two meanings in one word

Short summers lightly have a forward spring

How fares our cousin noble lord of York

He hath my lord

O my fair cousin I must not say so

He may command me as my sovereign

But you have power in me as in a kinsman

My dagger little cousin With all my heart

A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin

Ay gentle cousin were it light enough

It is too heavy for your Grace to wear

What would you have my weapon little lord

How

My lord will 't please you pass along

Myself and my good cousin Buckingham

Will to your mother to entreat of her

To meet you at the Tower and welcome you

Why what should you fear

Nor none that live I hope

No doubt no doubt O 'tis a parlous boy

Bold quick ingenious forward capable

He is all the mother's from the top to toe

Commend me to Lord William Tell him Catesby

His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries

Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle

And bid my lord for joy of this good news

Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more

Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep

At Crosby House there shall you find us both

Chop off his head Something we will determine

And look when I am king claim thou of me

The earldom of Hereford and all the movables

Whereof the King my brother was possessed

And look to have it yielded with all kindness

Come let us sup betimes that afterwards

We may digest our complots in some form

My noble lords and cousins all good morrow

I have been long a sleeper but I trust

My absence doth neglect no great design

Which by my presence might have been concluded

Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder

His Lordship knows me well and loves me well

My lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn

I saw good strawberries in your garden there

I do beseech you send for some of them

Cousin of Buckingham a word with you

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business

And finds the testy gentleman so hot

That he will lose his head ere give consent

His master's child as worshipfully he terms it

Shall lose the royalty of England's throne

I pray you all tell me what they deserve

That do conspire my death with devilish plots

Of damnd witchcraft and that have prevailed

Upon my body with their hellish charms

Then be your eyes the witness of their evil

Look how I am bewitched Behold mine arm

Is like a blasted sapling withered up

And this is Edward's wife that monstrous witch

Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore

That by their witchcraft thus have markd me

If Thou protector of this damnd strumpet

Talk'st thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor

Off with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear

I will not dine until I see the same

Lovell and Ratcliffe look that it be done

The rest that love me rise and follow me

Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy color

Murder thy breath in middle of a word

And then again begin and stop again

As if thou were distraught and mad with terror

He is and see he brings the Mayor along

Look to the drawbridge there

Catesby o'erlook the walls

Look back Defend thee Here are enemies

Be patient They are friends Ratcliffe and Lovell

So dear I loved the man that I must weep

I took him for the plainest harmless creature

That breathed upon the Earth a Christian

Made him my book wherein my soul recorded

The history of all her secret thoughts

So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue

That his apparent open guilt omitted

I mean his conversation with Shore's wife

He lived from all attainder of suspects

What think you we are Turks or infidels

Or that we would against the form of law

Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death

But that the extreme peril of the case

The peace of England and our persons' safety

Enforced us to this execution

And to that end we wished your Lordship here

T' avoid the censures of the carping world

Go after after cousin Buckingham

The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post

There at your meetest vantage of the time

Infer the bastardy of Edward's children

Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen

Only for saying he would make his son

Heir to the Crownmeaning indeed his house

Which by the sign thereof was termd so

Moreover urge his hateful luxury

And bestial appetite in change of lust

Which stretched unto their servants daughters wives

Even where his raging eye or savage heart

Without control lusted to make a prey

Nay for a need thus far come near my person

Tell them when that my mother went with child

Of that insatiate Edward noble York

My princely father then had wars in France

And by true computation of the time

Found that the issue was not his begot

Which well appeard in his lineaments

Being nothing like the noble duke my father

Yet touch this sparingly as 'twere far off

Because my lord you know my mother lives

If you thrive well bring them to Baynard's Castle

Where you shall find me well accompanied

With reverend fathers and well-learnd bishops

Go Lovell with all speed to Doctor Shaa

Go thou to Friar Penker Bid them both

Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle

Now will I go to take some privy order

To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight

And to give order that no manner person

Have any time recourse unto the Princes

How now how now What say the citizens

Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children

And did they so

What tongueless blocks were they Would they not speak

Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come

I go An if you plead as well for them

As I can say nay to thee for myself

No doubt we bring it to a happy issue

My lord there needs no such apology

I do beseech your Grace to pardon me

Who earnest in the service of my God

Deferred the visitation of my friends

But leaving this what is your Grace's pleasure

I do suspect I have done some offense

That seems disgracious in the city's eye

And that you come to reprehend my ignorance

Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land

I cannot tell if to depart in silence

Or bitterly to speak in your reproof

Best fitteth my degree or your condition

If not to answer you might haply think

Tongue-tied ambition not replying yielded

To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty

Which fondly you would here impose on me

If to reprove you for this suit of yours

So seasoned with your faithful love to me

Then on the other side I checked my friends

Therefore to speak and to avoid the first

And then in speaking not to incur the last

Definitively thus I answer you

Your love deserves my thanks but my desert

Unmeritable shuns your high request

First if all obstacles were cut away

And that my path were even to the crown

As the ripe revenue and due of birth

Yet so much is my poverty of spirit

So mighty and so many my defects

That I would rather hide me from my greatness

Being a bark to brook no mighty sea

Than in my greatness covet to be hid

And in the vapor of my glory smothered

But God be thanked there is no need of me

And much I need to help you were there need

The royal tree hath left us royal fruit

Which mellowed by the stealing hours of time

Will well become the seat of majesty

And make no doubt us happy by his reign

On him I lay that you would lay on me

The right and fortune of his happy stars

Which God defend that I should wring from him

Alas why would you heap this care on me

I am unfit for state and majesty

I do beseech you take it not amiss

I cannot nor I will not yield to you

O do not swear my lord of Buckingham

Will you enforce me to a world of cares

Call them again I am not made of stones

But penetrable to your kind entreaties

Albeit against my conscience and my soul

Cousin of Buckingham and sage grave men

Since you will buckle Fortune on my back

To bear her burden whe'er I will or no

I must have patience to endure the load

But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach

Attend the sequel of your imposition

Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me

From all the impure blots and stains thereof

For God doth know and you may partly see

How far I am from the desire of this

In saying so you shall but say the truth

Even when you please for you will have it so

Come let us to our holy work again

Farewell my cousin Farewell gentle friends

Stand all apartCousin of Buckingham

Give me thy hand  Thus high by thy advice

And thy assistance is King Richard seated

But shall we wear these glories for a day

Or shall they last and we rejoice in them

Ah Buckingham now do I play the touch

To try if thou be current gold indeed

Young Edward lives think now what I would speak

Why Buckingham I say I would be king

Ha Am I king 'Tis sobut Edward lives

O bitter consequence

That Edward still should live true noble prince

Cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull

Shall I be plain I wish the bastards dead

And I would have it suddenly performed

What sayst thou now Speak suddenly Be brief

Tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes

Say have I thy consent that they shall die

I will converse with iron-witted fools

And unrespective boys None are for me

That look into me with considerate eyes

High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect

Boy

Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold

Will tempt unto a close exploit of death

What is his name

I partly know the man Go call him hither boy

The deep-revolving witty Buckingham

No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels

Hath he so long held out with me untired

And stops he now for breath Well be it so

How now Lord Stanley what's the news

Come hither Catesby Rumor it abroad

That Anne my wife is very grievous sick

I will take order for her keeping close

Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman

Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter

The boy is foolish and I fear not him

Look how thou dream'st I say again give out

That Anne my queen is sick and like to die

About it for it stands me much upon

To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me

I must be married to my brother's daughter

Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass

Murder her brothers and then marry her

Uncertain way of gain But I am in

So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin

Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye

Is thy name Tyrrel

Art thou indeed

Dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine

Why then thou hast it Two deep enemies

Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers

Are they that I would have thee deal upon

Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower

Thou sing'st sweet music Hark come hither Tyrrel

Go by this token Rise and lend thine ear

There is no more but so Say it is done

And I will love thee and prefer thee for it

Well let that rest Dorset is fled to Richmond

Stanley he is your wife's son Well look unto it

Stanley look to your wife If she convey

Letters to Richmond you shall answer it

I do remember me Henry the Sixth

Did prophesy that Richmond should be king

When Richmond was a little peevish boy

A king perhaps

How chance the prophet could not at that time

Have told me I being by that I should kill him

Richmond When last I was at Exeter

The Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle

And called it Rougemont at which name I started

Because a bard of Ireland told me once

I should not live long after I saw Richmond

Ay what's o'clock

Well but what's o'clock

Well let it strike

Because that like a jack thou keep'st the stroke

Betwixt thy begging and my meditation

I am not in the giving vein today

Thou troublest me I am not in the vein

Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news

But did'st thou see them dead

And buried gentle Tyrrel

Come to me Tyrrel soon at after-supper

When thou shalt tell the process of their death

Meantime but think how I may do thee good

And be inheritor of thy desire

Farewell till then

The son of Clarence have I pent up close

His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage

The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom

And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight

Now for I know the Breton Richmond aims

At young Elizabeth my brother's daughter

And by that knot looks proudly on the crown

To her go I a jolly thriving wooer

Good or bad news that thou com'st in so bluntly

Ely with Richmond troubles me more near

Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength

Come I have learned that fearful commenting

Is leaden servitor to dull delay

Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary

Then fiery expedition be my wing

Jove's Mercury and herald for a king

Go muster men My counsel is my shield

We must be brief when traitors brave the field

Who intercepts me in my expedition

A flourish trumpets Strike alarum drums

Let not the heavens hear these telltale women

Rail on the Lord's anointed Strike I say

Either be patient and entreat me fair

Or with the clamorous report of war

Thus will I drown your exclamations

Ay I thank God my father and yourself

Madam I have a touch of your condition

That cannot brook the accent of reproof

Do then but I'll not hear

And brief good mother for I am in haste

And came I not at last to comfort you

Faith none but Humfrey Hower that called your Grace

To breakfast once forth of my company

If I be so disgracious in your eye

Let me march on and not offend you madam

Strike up the drum

You speak too bitterly

So

Stay madam I must talk a word with you

You have a daughter called Elizabeth

Virtuous and fair royal and gracious

Wrong not her birth She is a royal princess

Her life is safest only in her birth

Lo at their birth good stars were opposite

All unavoided is the doom of destiny

You speak as if that I had slain my cousins

Madam so thrive I in my enterprise

And dangerous success of bloody wars

As I intend more good to you and yours

Than ever you or yours by me were harmed

Th' advancement of your children gentle lady

Unto the dignity and height of fortune

The high imperial type of this Earth's glory

Even all I haveay and myself and all

Will I withal endow a child of thine

So in the Lethe of thy angry soul

Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs

Which thou supposest I have done to thee

Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter

What do you think

Be not so hasty to confound my meaning

I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter

And do intend to make her Queen of England

Even he that makes her queen Who else should be

Even so How think you of it

That would I learn of you

As one being best acquainted with her humor

Madam with all my heart

You mock me madam This is not the way

To win your daughter

Say that I did all this for love of her

Look what is done cannot be now amended

Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes

Which after-hours gives leisure to repent

If I did take the kingdom from your sons

To make amends I'll give it to your daughter

If I have killed the issue of your womb

To quicken your increase I will beget

Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter

A grandam's name is little less in love

Than is the doting title of a mother

They are as children but one step below

Even of your metal of your very blood

Of all one pain save for a night of groans

Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow

Your children were vexation to your youth

But mine shall be a comfort to your age

The loss you have is but a son being king

And by that loss your daughter is made queen

I cannot make you what amends I would

Therefore accept such kindness as I can

Dorset your son that with a fearful soul

Leads discontented steps in foreign soil

This fair alliance quickly shall call home

To high promotions and great dignity

The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife

Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother

Again shall you be mother to a king

And all the ruins of distressful times

Repaired with double riches of content

What we have many goodly days to see

The liquid drops of tears that you have shed

Shall come again transformed to orient pearl

Advantaging their love with interest

Of ten times double gain of happiness

Go then my mother to thy daughter go

Make bold her bashful years with your experience

Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale

Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame

Of golden sovereignty acquaint the Princess

With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys

And when this arm of mine hath chastisd

The petty rebel dull-brained Buckingham

Bound with triumphant garlands will I come

And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed

To whom I will retail my conquest won

And she shall be sole victoress Caesar's Caesar

Infer fair England's peace by this alliance

Tell her the King that may command entreats

Say she shall be a high and mighty queen

Say I will love her everlastingly

Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end

As long as heaven and nature lengthens it

Say I her sovereign am her subject low

Be eloquent in my behalf to her

Then plainly to her tell my loving tale

Your reasons are too shallow and too quick

Harp not on that string madam that is past

Now by my George my Garter and my crown

I swear

Then by myself

Now by the world

My father's death

Why then by God

The time to come

As I intend to prosper and repent

So thrive I in my dangerous affairs

Of hostile arms Myself myself confound

Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours

Day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest

Be opposite all planets of good luck

To my proceeding if with dear heart's love

Immaculate devotion holy thoughts

I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter

In her consists my happiness and thine

Without her follows to myself and thee

Herself the land and many a Christian soul

Death desolation ruin and decay

It cannot be avoided but by this

It will not be avoided but by this

Therefore dear motherI must call you so

Be the attorney of my love to her

Plead what I will be not what I have been

Not my deserts but what I will deserve

Urge the necessity and state of times

And be not peevish found in great designs

Ay if the devil tempt you to do good

Ay if your self's remembrance wrong yourself

But in your daughter's womb I bury them

Where in that nest of spicery they will breed

Selves of themselves to your recomforture

And be a happy mother by the deed

Bear her my true love's kiss and so farewell

Relenting fool and shallow changing woman

How now what news

Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk

Ratcliffe thyself or Catesby Where is he

Catesby fly to the Duke

Ratcliffe come hither Post to Salisbury

When thou com'st thitherDull unmindful villain

Why stay'st thou here and go'st not to the Duke

O true good Catesby Bid him levy straight

The greatest strength and power that he can make

And meet me suddenly at Salisbury

Why what wouldst thou do there before I go

My mind is changed    Stanley what news with you

Hoyday a riddle Neither good nor bad

What need'st thou run so many miles about

When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way

Once more what news

There let him sink and be the seas on him

White-livered runagate what doth he there

Well as you guess

Is the chair empty Is the sword unswayed

Is the King dead the empire unpossessed

What heir of York is there alive but we

And who is England's king but great York's heir

Then tell me what makes he upon the seas

Unless for that he comes to be your liege

You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes

Thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear

Where is thy power then to beat him back

Where be thy tenants and thy followers

Are they not now upon the western shore

Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships

Cold friends to me What do they in the north

When they should serve their sovereign in the west

Ay thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond

But I'll not trust thee

Go then and muster men but leave behind

Your son George Stanley Look your heart be firm

Or else his head's assurance is but frail

Out on you owls Nothing but songs of death

There take thou that till thou bring better news

I cry thee mercy

There is my purse to cure that blow of thine

Hath any well-advisd friend proclaimed

Reward to him that brings the traitor in

March on march on since we are up in arms

If not to fight with foreign enemies

Yet to beat down these rebels here at home

Away towards Salisbury While we reason here

A royal battle might be won and lost

Someone take order Buckingham be brought

To Salisbury The rest march on with me

Here pitch our tent even here in Bosworth field

My lord of Surrey why look you so sad

My lord of Norfolk

Norfolk we must have knocks ha must we not

Up with my tentHere will I lie tonight

But where tomorrow Well all's one for that

Who hath descried the number of the traitors

Why our battalia trebles that account

Besides the King's name is a tower of strength

Which they upon the adverse faction want

Up with the tentCome noble gentlemen

Let us survey the vantage of the ground

Call for some men of sound direction

Let's lack no discipline make no delay

For lords tomorrow is a busy day

What is 't o'clock

I will not sup tonight Give me some ink and paper

What is my beaver easier than it was

And all my armor laid into my tent

Good Norfolk hie thee to thy charge

Use careful watch Choose trusty sentinels

Stir with the lark tomorrow gentle Norfolk

Catesby

Send out a pursuivant-at-arms

To Stanley's regiment Bid him bring his power

Before sunrising lest his son George fall

Into the blind cave of eternal night

Fill me a bowl of wine Give me a watch

Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow

Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy

Ratcliffe

Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland

So I am satisfied Give me a bowl of wine

I have not that alacrity of spirit

Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have

Set it down Is ink and paper ready

Bid my guard watch Leave me

Ratcliffe about the mid of night come to my tent

And help to arm me Leave me I say

Give me another horse Bind up my wounds

Have mercy JesuSoft I did but dream

O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me

The lights burn blue it is now dead midnight

Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh

What do I fear Myself There's none else by

Richard loves Richard that is I am I

Is there a murderer here No Yes I am

Then fly What from myself Great reason why

Lest I revenge What myself upon myself

Alack I love myself Wherefore For any good

That I myself have done unto myself

O no Alas I rather hate myself

For hateful deeds committed by myself

I am a villain Yet I lie I am not

Fool of thyself speak well Fool do not flatter

My conscience hath a thousand several tongues

And every tongue brings in a several tale

And every tale condemns me for a villain

Perjury perjury in the highest degree

Murder stern murder in the direst degree

All several sins all used in each degree

Throng to the bar crying all Guilty guilty

I shall despair There is no creature loves me

And if I die no soul will pity me

And wherefore should they since that I myself

Find in myself no pity to myself

Methought the souls of all that I had murdered

Came to my tent and every one did threat

Tomorrow's vengeance on the head of Richard

Zounds who is there

O Ratcliffe I have dreamed a fearful dream

What think'st thou will our friends prove all true

O Ratcliffe I fear I fear

By the apostle Paul shadows tonight

Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard

Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers

Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond

'Tis not yet near day Come go with me

Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper

To see if any mean to shrink from me

What said Northumberland as touching Richmond

He said the truth And what said Surrey then

He was in the right and so indeed it is

Tell the clock there Give me a calendar

Who saw the sun today

Then he disdains to shine for by the book

He should have braved the east an hour ago

A black day will it be to somebody

Ratcliffe

The sun will not be seen today

The sky doth frown and lour upon our army

I would these dewy tears were from the ground

Not shine today Why what is that to me

More than to Richmond for the selfsame heaven

That frowns on me looks sadly upon him

Come bustle bustle Caparison my horse

Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power

I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain

And thus my battle shall be orderd

My foreward shall be drawn out all in length

Consisting equally of horse and foot

Our archers shall be placd in the midst

John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey

Shall have the leading of this foot and horse

They thus directed we will follow

In the main battle whose puissance on either side

Shall be well wingd with our chiefest horse

This and Saint George to bootWhat think'st thou Norfolk

Jockey of Norfolk be not so bold

For Dickon thy master is bought and sold

A thing devisd by the enemy

Go gentlemen every man unto his charge

Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls

Conscience is but a word that cowards use

Devised at first to keep the strong in awe

Our strong arms be our conscience swords our law

March on Join bravely Let us to it pell mell

If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell

What shall I say more than I have inferred

Remember whom you are to cope withal

A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways

A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants

Whom their o'ercloyd country vomits forth

To desperate adventures and assured destruction

You sleeping safe they bring to you unrest

You having lands and blessed with beauteous wives

They would restrain the one distain the other

And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow

Long kept in Brittany at our mother's cost

A milksop one that never in his life

Felt so much cold as overshoes in snow

Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again

Lash hence these overweening rags of France

These famished beggars weary of their lives

Who but for dreaming on this fond exploit

For want of means poor rats had hanged themselves

If we be conquered let men conquer us

And not these bastard Bretons whom our fathers

Have in their own land beaten bobbed and thumped

And in record left them the heirs of shame

Shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives

Ravish our daughters Hark I hear their drum

Fight gentlemen of EnglandFight bold yeomen

Draw archers draw your arrows to the head

Spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood

Amaze the welkin with your broken staves

What says Lord Stanley Will he bring his power

Off with his son George's head

A thousand hearts are great within my bosom

Advance our standards Set upon our foes

Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George

Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons

Upon them Victory sits on our helms

A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse

Slave I have set my life upon a cast

And I will stand the hazard of the die

I think there be six Richmonds in the field

Five have I slain today instead of him

A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
