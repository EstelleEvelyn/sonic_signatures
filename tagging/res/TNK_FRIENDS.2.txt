Good news.

Palamon has cleared you

And got your pardon, and discovered how

And by whose means he escaped, which was your daughter’s,

Whose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner,

Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,

Has given a sum of money to her marriage—

A large one, I’ll assure you.

Why, as it should be: they that ne’er begged

But they prevailed had their suits fairly granted;

The prisoners have their lives.

But there be new conditions, which you’ll hear of

At better time.

They are honorable;

How good they’ll prove I know not.

How he looks!

Not well?

Alas, what pity it is!

This is strange.

No; would she did.

Owgh, owgh, owgh!—’Tis up!

The wind’s fair!—Top the bowline!—Out with the

main sail! Where’s your whistle, master?

A fair wood.
