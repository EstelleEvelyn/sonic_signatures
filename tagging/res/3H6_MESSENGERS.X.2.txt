Whenas the noble Duke of York was slain,

Your princely father and my loving lord.

Environèd he was with many foes,

And stood against them, as the hope of Troy

Against the Greeks that would have entered Troy.

But Hercules himself must yield to odds;

And many strokes, though with a little axe,

Hews down and fells the hardest-timbered oak.

By many hands your father was subdued,

But only slaughtered by the ireful arm

Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,

Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite,

Laughed in his face; and when with grief he wept,

The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks

A napkin steepèd in the harmless blood

Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain.

And after many scorns, many foul taunts,

They took his head and on the gates of York

They set the same, and there it doth remain,

The saddest spectacle that e’er I viewed.
