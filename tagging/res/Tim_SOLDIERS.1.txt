Who's here Speak ho No answer What is this

Timon is dead who hath out-stretched his span

Some beast read this there does not live a man

Dead sure and this his grave What's on this tomb

I cannot read The character I'll take with wax

Our captain hath in every figure skill

An aged interpreter though young in days

Before proud Athens he's set down by this

Whose fall the mark of his ambition is

My noble general Timon is dead

Entombed upon the very hem o' th' sea

And on his gravestone this insculpture which

With wax I brought away whose soft impression

Interprets for my poor ignorance
