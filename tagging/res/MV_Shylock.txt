


Three thousand ducats, well.

For three months, well.

Antonio shall become bound, well.

Three thousand ducats for three months,

and Antonio bound.

Antonio is a good man.

Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he

is a good man is to have you understand me that he

is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he

hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the

Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto,

he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and

other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But

ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land

rats and water rats, water thieves and land

thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the

peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,

notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats.

I think I may take his bond.

I will be assured I may. And that I may be

assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with

Antonio?

Yes, to smell pork! To eat of the habitation

which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the

devil into! I will buy with you, sell with you, talk

with you, walk with you, and so following; but I

will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with

you.—What news on the Rialto?—Who is he comes

here?

How like a fawning publican he looks!

I hate him for he is a Christian,

But more for that in low simplicity

He lends out money gratis and brings down

The rate of usance here with us in Venice.

If I can catch him once upon the hip,

I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.

He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,

Even there where merchants most do congregate,

On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,

Which he calls “interest.” Cursèd be my tribe

If I forgive him!

I am debating of my present store,

And, by the near guess of my memory,

I cannot instantly raise up the gross

Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?

Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,

Will furnish me. But soft, how many months

Do you desire? Rest you fair, good signior!

Your Worship was the last man in our mouths.

Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

I had forgot—three months. You told me so.—

Well then, your bond. And let me see—but hear you:

Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow

Upon advantage.

When Jacob grazed his Uncle Laban’s sheep—

This Jacob from our holy Abram was

(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf)

The third possessor; ay, he was the third—

No, not take interest, not, as you would say,

Directly “interest.” Mark what Jacob did.

When Laban and himself were compromised

That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied

Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank

In end of autumn turnèd to the rams,

And when the work of generation was

Between these woolly breeders in the act,

The skillful shepherd pilled me certain wands,

And in the doing of the deed of kind

He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,

Who then conceiving did in eaning time

Fall parti-colored lambs, and those were Jacob’s.

This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;

And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.

I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.

But note me, signior—

Three thousand ducats. ’Tis a good round sum.

Three months from twelve, then let me see, the rate—

Signior Antonio, many a time and oft

In the Rialto you have rated me

About my moneys and my usances.

Still have I borne it with a patient shrug

(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe).

You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog,

And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,

And all for use of that which is mine own.

Well then, it now appears you need my help.

Go to, then. You come to me and you say

“Shylock, we would have moneys”—you say so,

You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,

And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur

Over your threshold. Moneys is your suit.

What should I say to you? Should I not say

“Hath a dog money? Is it possible

A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or

Shall I bend low, and in a bondman’s key,

With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,

Say this: “Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;

You spurned me such a day; another time

You called me ‘dog’; and for these courtesies

I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?

Why, look you how you storm!

I would be friends with you and have your love,

Forget the shames that you have stained me with,

Supply your present wants, and take no doit

Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me!

This is kind I offer.

This kindness will I show.

Go with me to a notary, seal me there

Your single bond; and in a merry sport,

If you repay me not on such a day,

In such a place, such sum or sums as are

Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit

Be nominated for an equal pound

Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken

In what part of your body pleaseth me.

O father Abram, what these Christians are,

Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect

The thoughts of others! Pray you tell me this:

If he should break his day, what should I gain

By the exaction of the forfeiture?

A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man

Is not so estimable, profitable neither,

As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,

To buy his favor I extend this friendship.

If he will take it, so. If not, adieu;

And for my love I pray you wrong me not.

Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.

Give him direction for this merry bond,

And I will go and purse the ducats straight,

See to my house left in the fearful guard

Of an unthrifty knave, and presently

I’ll be with you.

Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,

The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.—

What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandize

As thou hast done with me—what, Jessica!—

And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out.—

Why, Jessica, I say!

Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.

I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.

There are my keys.—But wherefore should I go?

I am not bid for love. They flatter me.

But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon

The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl,

Look to my house.—I am right loath to go.

There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,

For I did dream of money bags tonight.

So do I his.

What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica,

Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum

And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife,

Clamber not you up to the casements then,

Nor thrust your head into the public street

To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces,

But stop my house’s ears (I mean my casements).

Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter

My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear

I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.

But I will go.—Go you before me, sirrah.

Say I will come.

What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?

The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,

Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day

More than the wildcat. Drones hive not with me,

Therefore I part with him, and part with him

To one that I would have him help to waste

His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in.

Perhaps I will return immediately.

Do as I bid you. Shut doors after you.

Fast bind, fast find—

A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

You knew, none so well, none so well as you,

of my daughter’s flight.

She is damned for it.

My own flesh and blood to rebel!

I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.

There I have another bad match! A bankrout,

a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on

the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug

upon the mart! Let him look to his bond. He was

wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He

was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy; let

him look to his bond.

To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else,

it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and

hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses,

mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted

my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies—

and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not

a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,

senses, affections, passions? Fed with the

same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to

the same diseases, healed by the same means,

warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer

as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not

bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you

poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall

we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will

resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,

what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong

a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian

example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I

will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the

instruction.

How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa?

Hast thou found my daughter?

Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond

gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt!

The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I

never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that,

and other precious, precious jewels! I would my

daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her

ear; would she were hearsed at my foot and the

ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And

I know not what’s spent in the search! Why, thou

loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so

much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no

revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights a’ my

shoulders, no sighs but a’ my breathing, no tears but

a’ my shedding.

What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?

I thank God, I thank God! Is it true, is it true?

I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good

news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa—

Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never

see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting,

fourscore ducats!

I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll

torture him. I am glad of it.

Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It

was my turquoise! I had it of Leah when I was a

bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness

of monkeys.

Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal,

fee me an officer. Bespeak him a fortnight before. I

will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he

out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.

Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good

Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.

Jailer, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.

This is the fool that lent out money gratis.

Jailer, look to him.

I’ll have my bond. Speak not against my bond.

I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.

Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,

But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.

The Duke shall grant me justice.—I do wonder,

Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond

To come abroad with him at his request.

I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.

I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.

I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,

To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield

To Christian intercessors. Follow not!

I’ll have no speaking. I will have my bond.

I have possessed your Grace of what I purpose,

And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn

To have the due and forfeit of my bond.

If you deny it, let the danger light

Upon your charter and your city’s freedom!

You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have

A weight of carrion flesh than to receive

Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that,

But say it is my humor. Is it answered?

What if my house be troubled with a rat,

And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats

To have it baned? What, are you answered yet?

Some men there are love not a gaping pig,

Some that are mad if they behold a cat,

And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ th’ nose,

Cannot contain their urine; for affection

Masters oft passion, sways it to the mood

Of what it likes or loathes. Now for your answer:

As there is no firm reason to be rendered

Why he cannot abide a gaping pig,

Why he a harmless necessary cat,

Why he a woolen bagpipe, but of force

Must yield to such inevitable shame

As to offend, himself being offended,

So can I give no reason, nor I will not,

More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing

I bear Antonio, that I follow thus

A losing suit against him. Are you answered?

I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

If every ducat in six thousand ducats

Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,

I would not draw them. I would have my bond.

What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?

You have among you many a purchased slave,

Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,

You use in abject and in slavish parts

Because you bought them. Shall I say to you

“Let them be free! Marry them to your heirs!

Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds

Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates

Be seasoned with such viands”? You will answer

“The slaves are ours!” So do I answer you:

The pound of flesh which I demand of him

Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.

If you deny me, fie upon your law:

There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

I stand for judgment. Answer: shall I have it?

To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there.

No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,

Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.

Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall

To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.

Shylock is my name.

On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.

My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,

The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel.

O wise young judge, how I do honor thee!

Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven!

Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

No, not for Venice!

When it is paid according to the tenor.

It doth appear you are a worthy judge;

You know the law; your exposition

Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,

Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,

Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear

There is no power in the tongue of man

To alter me. I stay here on my bond.

O noble judge! O excellent young man!

’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,

How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

Ay, his breast!

So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?

“Nearest his heart.” Those are the very words.

I have them ready.

Is it so nominated in the bond?

I cannot find it. ’Tis not in the bond.

These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter—

Would any of the stock of Barabbas

Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!

We trifle time. I pray thee, pursue sentence.

Most rightful judge!

Most learnèd judge! A sentence!—Come, prepare.

Is that the law?

I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice

And let the Christian go.

Give me my principal and let me go.

Shall I not have barely my principal?

Why, then, the devil give him good of it!

I’ll stay no longer question.

Nay, take my life and all. Pardon not that.

You take my house when you do take the prop

That doth sustain my house; you take my life

When you do take the means whereby I live.

I am content.

I pray you give me leave to go from hence.

I am not well. Send the deed after me

And I will sign it.
