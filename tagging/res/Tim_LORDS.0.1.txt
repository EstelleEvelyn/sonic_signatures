That time serves still

Hang thyself

He's opposite to humanity Come shall we in

And taste Lord Timon's bounty He outgoes

The very heart of kindness

The noblest mind he carries

That ever governed man

My lord we always have confessed it

Might we but have that happiness my

lord that you would once use our hearts whereby

we might express some part of our zeals we

should think ourselves forever perfect

Where be our men

I am so far already in your gifts

O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that

O none so welcome

We are so virtuously bound

The best of happiness honor and fortunes

Keep with you Lord Timon
