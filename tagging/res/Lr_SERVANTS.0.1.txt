
Hold your hand, my lord.

I have served you ever since I was a child,

But better service have I never done you

Than now to bid you hold.

If you did wear a beard upon your chin,

I’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?

Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.

O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left

To see some mischief on him. O!
