Entreated me to call and know her mind;

There’s some great matter she’d employ me in.

Madam, madam!

Your servant, and your friend,

One that attends your Ladyship’s command.

As many, worthy lady, to yourself.

According to your Ladyship’s impose,

I am thus early come to know what service

It is your pleasure to command me in.

Madam, I pity much your grievances,

Which, since I know they virtuously are placed,

I give consent to go along with you,

Recking as little what betideth me

As much I wish all good befortune you.

When will you go?

Where shall I meet you?

I will not fail your Ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.

The sun begins to gild the western sky,

And now it is about the very hour

That Sylvia at Friar Patrick’s cell should meet me.

She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,

Unless it be to come before their time,

So much they spur their expedition.

See where she comes.—Lady, a happy evening.

Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;

If we recover that, we are sure enough.
