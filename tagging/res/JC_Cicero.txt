Why are you breathless? And why stare you so?

Why, saw you anything more wonderful?

Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time.

But men may construe things after their fashion,

Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.

Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?

Good night then, Casca. This disturbèd sky

Is not to walk in.
