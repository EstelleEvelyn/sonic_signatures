


Good even Casca Brought you Caesar home

Why are you breathless And why stare you so

Why saw you anything more wonderful

Indeed it is a strange-disposd time

But men may construe things after their fashion

Clean from the purpose of the things themselves

Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow

Good night then Casca This disturbd sky

Is not to walk in
