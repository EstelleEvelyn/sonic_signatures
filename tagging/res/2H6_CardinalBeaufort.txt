


Long live Queen Margaret England's happiness

Item it is further

agreed between them that the duchies of

Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered to

the King her father and she sent over of the King of

England's own proper cost and charges without

having any dowry

Nephew what means this passionate discourse

This peroration with such circumstance

For France 'tis ours and we will keep it still

My lord of Gloucester now you grow too hot

It was the pleasure of my lord the King

So there goes our Protector in a rage

'Tis known to you he is mine enemy

Nay more an enemy unto you all

And no great friend I fear me to the King

Consider lords he is the next of blood

And heir apparent to the English crown

Had Henry got an empire by his marriage

And all the wealthy kingdoms of the West

There's reason he should be displeased at it

Look to it lords Let not his smoothing words

Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect

What though the common people favor him

Calling him Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester

Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice

Jesu maintain your royal Excellence

With God preserve the good Duke Humphrey

I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss

He will be found a dangerous Protector

This weighty business will not brook delay

I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently

Ambitious Warwick let thy betters speak

The Commons hast thou racked the clergy's bags

Are lank and lean with thy extortions

I thought as much He would be above the clouds

Thy heaven is on Earth thine eyes and thoughts

Beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart

Pernicious Protector dangerous peer

That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal

Let me be blessd for the peace I make

Against this proud Protector with my sword

Marry when thou dar'st

Ay where thou dar'st not peep An if thou dar'st

This evening on the east side of the grove

Believe me cousin Gloucester

Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly

We had had more sport Come with thy two-hand sword

I am with you

Medice teipsum

Protector see to 't well protect yourself

Here comes the townsmen on procession

To present your Highness with the man

What art thou lame

Duke Humphrey has done a miracle today

And so my Lord Protector by this means

Your lady is forthcoming yet at London

This news I think hath turned your weapon's edge

'Tis like my lord you will not keep your hour

Did he not contrary to form of law

Devise strange deaths for small offenses done

It serves you well my lord to say so much

My liege his railing is intolerable

If those that care to keep your royal person

From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage

Be thus upbraided chid and rated at

And the offender granted scope of speech

'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace

Sirs take away the Duke and guard him sure

That he should die is worthy policy

But yet we want a color for his death

'Tis meet he be condemned by course of law

But I would have him dead my lord of Suffolk

Ere you can take due orders for a priest

Say you consent and censure well the deed

And I'll provide his executioner

I tender so the safety of my liege

A breach that craves a quick expedient stop

What counsel give you in this weighty cause

My lord of York try what your fortune is

Th' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms

And temper clay with blood of Englishmen

To Ireland will you lead a band of men

Collected choicely from each county some

And try your hap against the Irishmen

No more of him for I will deal with him

That henceforth he shall trouble us no more

And so break off the day is almost spent

Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event

God's secret judgment I did dream tonight

The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word

If thou be'st Death I'll give thee England's treasure

Enough to purchase such another island

So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain

Bring me unto my trial when you will

Died he not in his bed Where should he die

Can I make men live whe'er they will or no

O torture me no more I will confess

Alive again Then show me where he is

I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him

He hath no eyes The dust hath blinded them

Comb down his hair Look look It stands upright

Like lime-twigs set to catch my wingd soul

Give me some drink and bid the apothecary

Bring the strong poison that I bought of him
