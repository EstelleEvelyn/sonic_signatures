None, Brutus, none.

Live, Brutus, live, live!

We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up.

Peace, ho! Let us hear him.

The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.

You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.

The will! The testament!

Come down.

Stand back! Room! Bear back!

Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!

Slay! Let not a traitor live!

We’ll mutiny.

Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!

Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will.

Peace, ho!
