for him Cotus

Whence are you sirHas the

porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance

to such companionsPray get you out

Away Get you away

Are you so brave I'll have you

talked with anon

And I shall

Here sir I'd have beaten him like

a dog but for disturbing the lords within

By my hand I had thought to

have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind

gave me his clothes made a false report of him

Nay I knew by his face that there

was something in him He had sir a kind of face

methoughtI cannot tell how to term it

So did I I'll be sworn He is simply

the rarest man i' th' world

Who my master

Worth six on him

Faith look you one cannot tell

how to say that For the defense of a town our general

is excellent

What what what Let's partake

Wherefore Wherefore

Come we are fellows and friends

He was ever too hard for him I have heard him

say so himself

An he had been cannibally given

he might have boiled and eaten him too

And he's as like to do 't as any

man I can imagine

Why then we shall have a stirring

world again This peace is nothing but to rust iron

increase tailors and breed ballad-makers

'Tis so and as wars in some sort

may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied

but peace is a great maker of cuckolds

In in in in
