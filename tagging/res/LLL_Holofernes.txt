blood ripe as the pomewater who now hangeth

like a jewel in the ear of caelo the sky the welkin

the heaven and anon falleth like a crab on the face

of terra the soil the land the earth

Sir Nathaniel haud credo

Most barbarous intimation Yet a kind of

insinuation as it were in via in way of explication

facere as it were replication or rather ostentare to

show as it were his inclination after his undressed

unpolished uneducated unpruned untrained or

rather unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion

to insert again my haud credo for a deer

Twice-sod simplicity bis coctus

O thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look

Dictynna goodman Dull Dictynna

goodman Dull

The moon was a month old when Adam was no more

And raught not to five weeks when he came to fivescore

Th' allusion holds in the exchange

God comfort thy capacity I say th' allusion

holds in the exchange

Sir Nathaniel will you hear an extemporal

epitaph on the death of the deer And to humor

the ignorant call I the deer the Princess killed a

pricket

I will something affect the letter for it

argues facility

The preyful princess pierced and pricked a pretty pleasing pricket

Some say a sore but not a sore till now made sore with shooting

The dogs did yell Put l to sore then sorel jumps from thicket

Or pricket sore or else sorel The people fall a-hooting

If sore be sore then L to sore makes fifty sores o' sorel

Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L

This is a gift that I have simple simple

a foolish extravagant spirit full of forms

figures shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions

revolutions These are begot in the ventricle

of memory nourished in the womb of pia mater

and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion But

the gift is good in those in whom it is acute and I

am thankful for it

Mehercle if their sons be ingenious

they shall want no instruction if their daughters be

capable I will put it to them But Vir sapis qui pauca

loquitur A soul feminine saluteth us

Master Person quasi pierce one And

if one should be pierced which is the one

Of piercing a hogshead A good luster

of conceit in a turf of earth fire enough for a flint

pearl enough for a swine 'Tis pretty it is well

Facile precor gelida quando peccas omnia sub umbra

Ruminat

and so forth Ah good old Mantuan I may speak of

thee as the traveler doth of Venice

Venetia Venetia

Chi non ti vede non ti pretia

Old Mantuan old Mantuan Who understandeth

thee not loves thee not Ut re sol la

the contents Or rather as Horace says in his

What my soul verses

 Let me hear a staff a stanza a verse

Lege domine

You find not the apostrophus and so

miss the accent Let me supervise the canzonet

Here are only numbers ratified

but for the elegancy facility and golden cadence of

poesycaret Ovidius Naso was the man And why

indeed Naso but for smelling out the odoriferous

flowers of fancy the jerks of invention Imitari is

nothing so doth the hound his master the ape his

keeper the tired horse his riderBut damosella

virgin was this directed to you

I will overglance the superscript To

the snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady

Rosaline I will look again on the intellect of the

letter for the nomination of the party writing to

the person written unto Your Ladyship's in all

desired employment Berowne Sir Nathaniel this

Berowne is one of the votaries with the King and

here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the

stranger queen's which accidentally or by the way

of progression hath miscarried

Trip and go my sweet Deliver this paper into the

royal hand of the King It may concern much Stay

not thy compliment I forgive thy duty Adieu

Sir tell not me of the Father I do fear

colorable colors But to return to the verses did

they please you Sir Nathaniel

I do dine today at the father's of a certain

pupil of mine where if before repast it shall

please you to gratify the table with a grace I will

on my privilege I have with the parents of the

foresaid child or pupil undertake your ben venuto

where I will prove those verses to be very unlearned

neither savoring of poetry wit nor invention

I beseech your society

And certes the text most infallibly concludes

it Sir I do invite you too You shall

not say me nay Pauca verba Away The gentles are

at their game and we will to our recreation

Satis quid sufficit

Novi hominem tanquam te His humor

is lofty his discourse peremptory his tongue filed

his eye ambitious his gait majestical and his general

behavior vain ridiculous and thrasonical He is

too picked too spruce too affected too odd as it

were too peregrinate as I may call it

He draweth out the thread of his verbosity

finer than the staple of his argument I abhor

such fanatical phantasimes such insociable and

point-devise companions such rackers of orthography

as to speak dout fine when he should

say doubt det when he should pronounce

Ba pueritia with a horn added

Quis quis thou consonant

I will repeat them a e i

Thou disputes like an infant Go whip thy

Oh I smell false Latin Dunghill for

The posterior of the day most generous

sir is liable congruent and measurable for

the afternoon the word is well culled chose

sweet and apt I do assure you sir I do assure

Sir you shall present before her the Nine

WorthiesSir Nathaniel as concerning some

entertainment of time some show in the posterior

of this day to be rendered by our assistance the

King's command and this most gallant illustrate

and learned gentleman before the PrincessI say

none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies

Joshua yourself myself and this gallant

gentleman Judas Maccabaeus This swain because

of his great limb or joint shall pass Pompey

the Great the page Hercules

Shall I have audience He shall present

Hercules in minority His enter and exit shall be

strangling a snake and I will have an apology for

that purpose

I will play three myself

We attend

Via goodman Dull Thou hast spoken no

word all this while

Allons We will employ thee

Most dull honest Dull To our sport

Away

Great Hercules is presented by this imp

Whose club killed Cerberus that three-headed canus

And when he was a babe a child a shrimp

Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus

Quoniam he seemeth in minority

Ergo I come with this apology

Keep some state in thy exit and vanish

Judas I am

Not Iscariot sir

Judas I am yclept Maccabaeus

Judas I am

What mean you sir

Begin sir you are my elder

I will not be put out of countenance

What is this

You have put me out of countenance

But you have outfaced them all

This is not generous not gentle not humble
