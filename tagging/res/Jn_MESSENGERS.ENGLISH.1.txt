


From France to England Never such a power

For any foreign preparation

Was levied in the body of a land

The copy of your speed is learned by them

For when you should be told they do prepare

The tidings comes that they are all arrived

My liege her ear

Is stopped with dust The first of April died

Your noble mother And as I hear my lord

The Lady Constance in a frenzy died

Three days before But this from rumor's tongue

I idly heard If true or false I know not

Under the Dauphin

With all my heart my liege

My lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge

Desires your Majesty to leave the field

And send him word by me which way you go

Be of good comfort for the great supply

That was expected by the Dauphin here

Are wracked three nights ago on Goodwin Sands

This news was brought to Richard but even now

The French fight coldly and retire themselves
