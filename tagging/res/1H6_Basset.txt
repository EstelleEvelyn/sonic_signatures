The envious barking of your saucy tongue

Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.

Why, what is he? As good a man as York.

Villain, thou knowest the law of arms is such

That whoso draws a sword ’tis present death,

Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.

But I’ll unto his Majesty, and crave

I may have liberty to venge this wrong,

When thou shalt see I’ll meet thee to thy cost.

And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.

And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.

Crossing the sea from England into France,

This fellow here with envious carping tongue

Upbraided me about the rose I wear,

Saying the sanguine color of the leaves

Did represent my master’s blushing cheeks

When stubbornly he did repugn the truth

About a certain question in the law

Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him,

With other vile and ignominious terms.

In confutation of which rude reproach,

And in defense of my lord’s worthiness,

I crave the benefit of law of arms.

Confirm it so, mine honorable lord.
