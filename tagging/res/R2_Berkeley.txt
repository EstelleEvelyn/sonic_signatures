


My Lord of Hereford my message is to you

Mistake me not my lord 'tis not my meaning

To rase one title of your honor out

To you my lord I come what lord you will

From the most gracious regent of this land

The Duke of York to know what pricks you on

To take advantage of the absent time

And fright our native peace with self-borne arms
