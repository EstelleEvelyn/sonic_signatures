That can translate the stubbornness of fortune

Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

Under the greenwood tree

Who loves to lie with me

And turn his merry note

Unto the sweet bird’s throat,

Come hither, come hither, come hither.

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.

It will make you melancholy, Monsieur

Jaques.

My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.

What you will, Monsieur Jaques.

More at your request than to please myself.

Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while;

the Duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been

all this day to look you.

Who doth ambition shun

And loves to live i’ th’ sun,

Seeking the food he eats

And pleased with what he gets,

Come hither, come hither, come hither.

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.

And I’ll sing it.

What’s that “ducdame”?

And I’ll go seek the Duke. His banquet is

prepared.

Blow, blow, thou winter wind.

Thou art not so unkind

As man’s ingratitude.

Thy tooth is not so keen,

Because thou art not seen,

Although thy breath be rude.

Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.

Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.

Then heigh-ho, the holly.

This life is most jolly.

Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,

That dost not bite so nigh

As benefits forgot.

Though thou the waters warp,

Thy sting is not so sharp

As friend remembered not.

Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.

Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.

Then heigh-ho, the holly.

This life is most jolly.
