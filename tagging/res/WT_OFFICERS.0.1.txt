Appear in person here in court.    Silence!

Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes,

King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned

of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes,

King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo

to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy

royal husband; the pretense whereof being by circumstances

partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to

the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel

and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by

night.

You here shall swear upon this sword of justice

That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have

Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought

This sealed-up oracle, by the hand delivered

Of great Apollo’s priest, and that since then

You have not dared to break the holy seal

Nor read the secrets in ’t.

Hermione is chaste, Polixenes blameless,

Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant,

his innocent babe truly begotten; and the King shall

live without an heir if that which is lost be not

found.

Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.
