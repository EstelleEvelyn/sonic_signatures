
I will do ’t; but yet

She is a goodly creature.

I am resolved.

I warrant you, madam.

Southwest.

Was ’t so?

When was this?

Come, say your prayers.

If you require a little space for prayer,

I grant it. Pray, but be not tedious, for

The gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn

To do my work with haste.

To satisfy my lady.

My commission

Is not to reason of the deed, but do ’t.

I am sworn

And will dispatch.

These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes,

And they have seized Marina. Let her go.

There’s no hope she will return. I’ll swear she’s dead,

And thrown into the sea. But I’ll see further.

Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,

Not carry her aboard. If she remain,

Whom they have ravished must by me be slain.
