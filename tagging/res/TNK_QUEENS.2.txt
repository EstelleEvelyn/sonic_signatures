
For your mother's sake

And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair ones

Hear and respect me

Honored Hippolyta

Most dreaded Amazonian that hast slain

The scythe-tusked boar that with thy arm as strong

As it is white wast near to make the male

To thy sex captive but that this thy lord

Born to uphold creation in that honor

First nature styled it in shrunk thee into

The bound thou wast o'erflowing at once subduing

Thy force and thy affection soldieress

That equally canst poise sternness with pity

Whom now I know hast much more power on him

Than ever he had on thee who ow'st his strength

And his love too who is a servant for

The tenor of thy speech dear glass of ladies

Bid him that we whom flaming war doth scorch

Under the shadow of his sword may cool us

Require him he advance it o'er our heads

Speak 't in a woman's key like such a woman

As any of us three weep ere you fail

Lend us a knee

But touch the ground for us no longer time

Than a dove's motion when the head's plucked off

Tell him if he i' th' blood-sized field lay swoll'n

Showing the sun his teeth grinning at the moon

What you would do

What griefs our beds

That our dear lords have none

Now you may take him

Drunk with his victory

Farewell

We come unseasonably but when could grief

Cull forth as unpanged judgment can fitt'st time

For best solicitation

O help now

Our cause cries for your knee

And earn'st a deity equal with Mars

Both heaven and Earth

Friend thee forever

Urns and odors bring away

Vapors sighs darken the day

Our dole more deadly looks than dying

Balms and gums and heavy cheers

Sacred vials filled with tears

And clamors through the wild air flying

Come all sad and solemn shows

That are quick-eyed Pleasure's foes

We convent naught else but woes

We convent naught else but woes

And this to yours
