There to meet with Macbeth.

Anon.

Fair is foul, and foul is fair;

Hover through the fog and filthy air.

Sister, where thou?

And I another.

A drum, a drum!

Macbeth doth come.

The Weïrd Sisters, hand in hand,

Posters of the sea and land,

Thus do go about, about,

Thrice to thine and thrice to mine

And thrice again, to make up nine.

Peace, the charm’s wound up.

All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!

Hail!

Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.

So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

Harpier cries “’Tis time, ’tis time!”

Double, double toil and trouble;

Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

Double, double toil and trouble;

Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,

Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf

Of the ravined salt-sea shark,

Root of hemlock digged i’ th’ dark,

Liver of blaspheming Jew,

Gall of goat and slips of yew

Slivered in the moon’s eclipse,

Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips,

Finger of birth-strangled babe

Ditch-delivered by a drab,

Make the gruel thick and slab.

Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron

For th’ ingredience of our cauldron.

Double, double toil and trouble;

Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

A deed without a name.

We’ll answer.

Come high or low;

Thyself and office deftly show.

Listen but speak not to ’t.

Seek to know no more.

Show.

Show his eyes and grieve his heart.

Come like shadows; so depart.
