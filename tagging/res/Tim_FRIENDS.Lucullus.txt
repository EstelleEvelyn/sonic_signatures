warrant. Why, this hits right. I dreamt of a silver

basin and ewer tonight.—Flaminius, honest

Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir.

Fill me some wine.

And how does that honorable, complete, free-hearted

gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful

good lord and master?

I am right glad that his health is well, sir.

And what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty

Flaminius?

La, la, la, la. “Nothing doubting” says he?

Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman ’tis, if he would

not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I

ha’ dined with him and told him on ’t, and come

again to supper to him of purpose to have him

spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel,

take no warning by my coming. Every man has his

fault, and honesty is his. I ha’ told him on ’t, but I

could ne’er get him from ’t.

Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise.

Here’s to thee.

I have observed thee always for a towardly

prompt spirit—give thee thy due—and one that

knows what belongs to reason and canst use the

time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in

thee.—Get you gone, sirrah.

Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord’s a bountiful

gentleman, but thou art wise and thou

know’st well enough, although thou com’st to me,

that this is no time to lend money, especially upon

bare friendship, without security. Here’s three solidares

for thee. Good boy,

wink at me, and say thou saw’st me not. Fare thee

well.

Ha! Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy

master.
