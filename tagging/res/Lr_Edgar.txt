


How now brother Edmund what serious contemplation

are you in

Do you busy yourself with that

How long have you been a sectary

astronomical

The night gone by

Ay two hours together

None at all

Some villain hath done me wrong

Armed brother

Shall I hear from you anon

I am sure on 't not a word

I heard myself proclaimed

And by the happy hollow of a tree

Escaped the hunt No port is free no place

That guard and most unusual vigilance

Does not attend my taking Whiles I may 'scape

I will preserve myself and am bethought

To take the basest and most poorest shape

That ever penury in contempt of man

Brought near to beast My face I'll grime with filth

Blanket my loins elf all my hairs in knots

And with presented nakedness outface

The winds and persecutions of the sky

The country gives me proof and precedent

Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices

Strike in their numbed and mortifid arms

Pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary

And with this horrible object from low farms

Poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills

Sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers

Enforce their charity Poor Turlygod Poor Tom

That's something yet Edgar I nothing am

Fathom and half fathom and half

Poor Tom

Away The foul fiend follows me Through the

sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind Hum Go to

thy cold bed and warm thee

Who gives anything to Poor Tom whom the

foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame

through ford and whirlpool o'er bog and quagmire

that hath laid knives under his pillow and

halters in his pew set ratsbane by his porridge

made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting

horse over four-inched bridges to course his own

shadow for a traitor Bless thy five wits Tom's

a-cold O do de do de do de Bless thee from

whirlwinds star-blasting and taking Do Poor Tom

some charity whom the foul fiend vexes There

could I have him now and thereand there again

and there

Pillicock sat on Pillicock Hill Alow alow loo

Take heed o' th' foul fiend Obey thy parents

keep thy word's justice swear not commit not with

man's sworn spouse set not thy sweet heart on

proud array Tom's a-cold

A servingman proud in heart and mind that

curled my hair wore gloves in my cap served the

lust of my mistress' heart and did the act of

darkness with her swore as many oaths as I spake

words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven

one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to

do it Wine loved I deeply dice dearly and in

woman out-paramoured the Turk False of heart

light of ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox in

stealth wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in

prey Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling

of silks betray thy poor heart to woman Keep thy

foot out of brothels thy hand out of plackets thy

pen from lenders' books and defy the foul fiend

Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind

says suum mun nonny Dolphin my boy boy sessa

Let him trot by

This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet He begins

at curfew and walks till the first cock He

gives the web and the pin squints the eye and

makes the harelip mildews the white wheat and

hurts the poor creature of earth

Swithold footed thrice the 'old

He met the nightmare and her ninefold

Bid her alight

And her troth plight

And aroint thee witch aroint thee

Poor Tom that eats the swimming frog the

toad the tadpole the wall newt and the water

that in the fury of his heart when the foul fiend

rages eats cow dung for sallets swallows the old

rat and the ditch-dog drinks the green mantle of

the standing pool who is whipped from tithing to

tithing and stocked punished and imprisoned

who hath had three suits to his back six shirts to

his body

Horse to ride and weapon to wear

But mice and rats and such small deer

Have been Tom's food for seven long year

Beware my follower Peace Smulkin Peace thou

fiend

The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman Modo

he's called and Mahu

Poor Tom's a-cold

How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin

Tom's a-cold

Child Rowland to the dark tower came

His word was still Fie foh and fum

I smell the blood of a British man

Frateretto calls me and tells me Nero is an

angler in the lake of darkness Pray innocent and

beware the foul fiend

The foul fiend bites my back

Look where he stands and glaresWant'st

thou eyes at trial madam

Come o'er the burn Bessy to me

The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of

a nightingale Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for

two white herringCroak not black angel I have

no food for thee

Let us deal justly

Sleepest or wakest thou jolly shepherd

Thy sheep be in the corn

And for one blast of thy minikin mouth

Thy sheep shall take no harm

Purr the cat is gray

Bless thy five wits

My tears begin to take his part so much

They mar my counterfeiting

Tom will throw his head at themAvaunt you

curs

Be thy mouth or black or white

Tooth that poisons if it bite

Mastiff greyhound mongrel grim

Hound or spaniel brach or lym

Bobtail tike or trundle-tail

Tom will make him weep and wail

For with throwing thus my head

Dogs leapt the hatch and all are fled

Do de de de Sessa Come march to wakes

and fairs and market towns Poor Tom thy horn

is dry

When we our betters see bearing our woes

We scarcely think our miseries our foes

Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind

Leaving free things and happy shows behind

But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip

When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship

How light and portable my pain seems now

When that which makes me bend makes the King bow

He childed as I fathered Tom away

Mark the high noises and thyself bewray

When false opinion whose wrong thoughts defile thee

In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee

What will hap more tonight safe 'scape the King

Lurk lurk

Yet better thus and known to be contemned

Than still contemned and flattered To be worst

The lowest and most dejected thing of Fortune

Stands still in esperance lives not in fear

The lamentable change is from the best

The worst returns to laughter Welcome then

Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace

The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst

Owes nothing to thy blasts But who comes here

My father poorly led World world O world

But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee

Life would not yield to age

O gods who is 't can say I am at the worst

I am worse than e'er I was

And worse I may be yet The worst is not

So long as we can say This is the worst

How should this be

Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow

Ang'ring itself and othersBless thee master

Poor Tom's a-cold I cannot daub it further

And yet I mustBless thy sweet eyes they bleed

Both stile and gate horseway and footpath

Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits

Bless thee good man's son from the foul fiend

Five fiends have been in Poor Tom at once of lust

as Obidicut Hobbididance prince of dumbness

Mahu of stealing Modo of murder Flibbertigibbet

of mopping and mowing who since possesses

chambermaids and waiting women So bless

thee master

Ay master

Give me thy arm

Poor Tom shall lead thee

You do climb up it now Look how we labor

Horrible steep

Hark do you hear the sea

Why then your other senses grow imperfect

By your eyes' anguish

You're much deceived in nothing am I changed

But in my garments

Come on sir Here's the place Stand still How fearful

And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low

The crows and choughs that wing the midway air

Show scarce so gross as beetles Halfway down

Hangs one that gathers samphiredreadful trade

Methinks he seems no bigger than his head

The fishermen that walk upon the beach

Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark

Diminished to her cock her cock a buoy

Almost too small for sight The murmuring surge

That on th' unnumbered idle pebble chafes

Cannot be heard so high I'll look no more

Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight

Topple down headlong

Give me your hand You are now within a foot

Of th' extreme verge For all beneath the moon

Would I not leap upright

Now fare you well good sir

Why I do trifle thus with his despair

Is done to cure it

Gone sir Farewell

And yet I know not how conceit may rob

The treasury of life when life itself

Yields to the theft Had he been where he thought

By this had thought been past Alive or dead

Ho you sir Friend hear you Sir speak

Thus might he pass indeed Yet he revives

What are you sir

Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air

So many fathom down precipitating

Thou 'dst shivered like an egg but thou dost breathe

Hast heavy substance bleed'st not speak'st art sound

Ten masts at each make not the altitude

Which thou hast perpendicularly fell

Thy life's a miracle Speak yet again

From the dread summit of this chalky bourn

Look up a-height The shrill-gorged lark so far

Cannot be seen or heard Do but look up

Give me your arm

Up So how is 't Feel you your legs You stand

This is above all strangeness

Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that

Which parted from you

As I stood here below methought his eyes

Were two full moons he had a thousand noses

Horns whelked and waved like the enragd sea

It was some fiend Therefore thou happy father

Think that the clearest gods who make them honors

Of men's impossibilities have preserved thee

Bear free and patient thoughts    But who comes here

The safer sense will ne'er accommodate

His master thus

O thou side-piercing sight

Sweet marjoram

I would not take this from report It is

And my heart breaks at it

O matter and impertinency mixed

Reason in madness

Hail gentle sir

Do you hear aught sir of a battle toward

But by your favor

How near's the other army

I thank you sir That's all

I thank you sir

Well pray you father

A most poor man made tame to Fortune's blows

Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows

Am pregnant to good pity Give me your hand

I'll lead you to some biding

Chill not let go zir without vurther 'casion

Good gentleman go your gait and let poor

volk pass An 'chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my

life 'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight

Nay come not near th' old man Keep out

che vor' ye or Ise try whether your costard or my

ballow be the harder Chill be plain with you

Chill pick your teeth zir Come no matter vor

I know thee well a serviceable villain

As duteous to the vices of thy mistress

As badness would desire

Sit you down father rest you

Let's see these pockets The letters that he speaks of

May be my friends He's dead I am only sorry

He had no other deathsman Let us see

Leave gentle wax and manners blame us not

To know our enemies' minds we rip their hearts

Their papers is more lawful

Let our reciprocal vows be remembered You have

many opportunities to cut him off If your will want

not time and place will be fruitfully offered There is

nothing done if he return the conqueror Then am I

the prisoner and his bed my jail from the loathed

warmth whereof deliver me and supply the place for

your labor

Your wife so I would say affectionate servant

and for you her own for ventureGoneril

O indistinguished space of woman's will

A plot upon her virtuous husband's life

And the exchange my brotherHere in the sands

Thee I'll rake up the post unsanctified

Of murderous lechers and in the mature time

With this ungracious paper strike the sight

Of the death-practiced duke For him 'tis well

That of thy death and business I can tell

Give me your hand

Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum

Come father I'll bestow you with a friend

If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor

Hear me one word

Before you fight the battle ope this letter

If you have victory let the trumpet sound

For him that brought it Wretched though I seem

I can produce a champion that will prove

What is avouchd there If you miscarry

Your business of the world hath so an end

And machination ceases Fortune love you

I was forbid it

When time shall serve let but the herald cry

And I'll appear again

Here father take the shadow of this tree

For your good host Pray that the right may thrive

If ever I return to you again

I'll bring you comfort

Away old man Give me thy hand Away

King Lear hath lost he and his daughter ta'en

Give me thy hand Come on

What in ill thoughts again Men must endure

Their going hence even as their coming hither

Ripeness is all Come on

Know my name is lost

By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit

Yet am I noble as the adversary

I come to cope

What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester

Draw thy sword

That if my speech offend a noble heart

Thy arm may do thee justice Here is mine

Behold it is my privilege the privilege of mine honors

My oath and my profession I protest

Maugre thy strength place youth and eminence

Despite thy victor-sword and fire-new fortune

Thy valor and thy heart thou art a traitor

False to thy gods thy brother and thy father

Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince

And from th' extremest upward of thy head

To the descent and dust below thy foot

A most toad-spotted traitor Say thou no

This sword this arm and my best spirits are bent

To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak

Thou liest

Let's exchange charity

I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund

If more the more th' hast wronged me

My name is Edgar and thy father's son

The gods are just and of our pleasant vices

Make instruments to plague us

The dark and vicious place where thee he got

Cost him his eyes

Worthy prince I know 't

By nursing them my lord List a brief tale

And when 'tis told O that my heart would burst

The bloody proclamation to escape

That followed me so nearO our lives' sweetness

That we the pain of death would hourly die

Rather than die at oncetaught me to shift

Into a madman's rags t' assume a semblance

That very dogs disdained and in this habit

Met I my father with his bleeding rings

Their precious stones new lost became his guide

Led him begged for him saved him from despair

NeverO faultrevealed myself unto him

Until some half hour past when I was armed

Not sure though hoping of this good success

I asked his blessing and from first to last

Told him our pilgrimage But his flawed heart

Alack too weak the conflict to support

'Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief

Burst smilingly

This would have seemed a period

To such as love not sorrow but another

To amplify too much would make much more

And top extremity Whilst I

Was big in clamor came there in a man

Who having seen me in my worst estate

Shunned my abhorred society but then finding

Who 'twas that so endured with his strong arms

He fastened on my neck and bellowed out

As he'd burst heaven threw him on my father

Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him

That ever ear received which in recounting

His grief grew puissant and the strings of life

Began to crack Twice then the trumpets sounded

And there I left him tranced

Kent sir the banished Kent who in disguise

Followed his enemy king and did him service

Improper for a slave

What kind of help

What means this bloody knife

Here comes Kent

To who my lord Who has the office Send

Thy token of reprieve

Haste thee for thy life

Or image of that horror

'Tis noble Kent your friend

Very bootless

He faints My lord my lord

Look up my lord

He is gone indeed

The weight of this sad time we must obey

Speak what we feel not what we ought to say

The oldest hath borne most we that are young

Shall never see so much nor live so long
