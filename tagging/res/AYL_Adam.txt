Yonder comes my master your brother

Sweet masters be patient For

your father's remembrance be at accord

Is old dog my reward Most true I have lost

my teeth in your service God be with my old

master He would not have spoke such a word

What my young master O my gentle master

O my sweet master O you memory

Of old Sir Rowland Why what make you here

Why are you virtuous Why do people love you

And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant

Why would you be so fond to overcome

The bonny prizer of the humorous duke

Your praise is come too swiftly home before you

Know you not master to some kind of men

Their graces serve them but as enemies

No more do yours Your virtues gentle master

Are sanctified and holy traitors to you

O what a world is this when what is comely

Envenoms him that bears it

O unhappy youth

Come not within these doors Within this roof

The enemy of all your graces lives

Your brotherno no brotheryet the son

Yet not the son I will not call him son

Of him I was about to call his father

Hath heard your praises and this night he means

To burn the lodging where you use to lie

And you within it If he fail of that

He will have other means to cut you off

I overheard him and his practices

This is no place this house is but a butchery

Abhor it fear it do not enter it

No matter whither so you come not here

But do not so I have five hundred crowns

The thrifty hire I saved under your father

Which I did store to be my foster nurse

When service should in my old limbs lie lame

And unregarded age in corners thrown

Take that and He that doth the ravens feed

Yea providently caters for the sparrow

Be comfort to my age Here is the gold

All this I give you Let me be your servant

Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty

For in my youth I never did apply

Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood

Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo

The means of weakness and debility

Therefore my age is as a lusty winter

Frosty but kindly Let me go with you

I'll do the service of a younger man

In all your business and necessities

Master go on and I will follow thee

To the last gasp with truth and loyalty

From seventeen years till now almost fourscore

Here livd I but now live here no more

At seventeen years many their fortunes seek

But at fourscore it is too late a week

Yet fortune cannot recompense me better

Than to die well and not my master's debtor

Dear master I can go no further O I die for

food Here lie I down and measure out my grave

Farewell kind master

So had you need

I scarce can speak to thank you for myself
