


My Dionyza shall we rest us here

And by relating tales of others' griefs

See if 'twill teach us to forget our own

O Dionyza

Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it

Or can conceal his hunger till he famish

Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes

Into the air our eyes do weep till lungs

Fetch breath that may proclaim them louder that

If heaven slumber while their creatures want

They may awake their helpers to comfort them

I'll then discourse our woes felt several years

And wanting breath to speak help me with tears

This Tarsus o'er which I have the government

A city on whom Plenty held full hand

For Riches strewed herself even in her streets

Whose towers bore heads so high they kissed the clouds

And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at

Whose men and dames so jetted and adorned

Like one another's glass to trim them by

Their tables were stored full to glad the sight

And not so much to feed on as delight

All poverty was scorned and pride so great

The name of help grew odious to repeat

But see what heaven can do by this our change

These mouths who but of late earth sea and air

Were all too little to content and please

Although they gave their creatures in abundance

As houses are defiled for want of use

They are now starved for want of exercise

Those palates who not yet two savors younger

Must have inventions to delight the taste

Would now be glad of bread and beg for it

Those mothers who to nuzzle up their babes

Thought naught too curious are ready now

To eat those little darlings whom they loved

So sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife

Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life

Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping

Here many sink yet those which see them fall

Have scarce strength left to give them burial

Is not this true

O let those cities that of Plenty's cup

And her prosperities so largely taste

With their superfluous riots hear these tears

The misery of Tarsus may be theirs

Here

Speak out thy sorrows which thee bring'st in haste

For comfort is too far for us to expect

I thought as much

One sorrow never comes but brings an heir

That may succeed as his inheritor

And so in ours Some neighboring nation

Taking advantage of our misery

Hath stuffed the hollow vessels with their power

To beat us down the which are down already

And make a conquest of unhappy men

Whereas no glory's got to overcome

Thou speak'st like him's untutored to repeat

Who makes the fairest show means most deceit

But bring they what they will and what they can

What need we fear

The ground's the lowest and we are halfway there

Go tell their general we attend him here

To know for what he comes and whence he comes

And what he craves

Welcome is peace if he on peace consist

If wars we are unable to resist

The gods of Greece protect you and we'll pray for you

The which when any shall not gratify

Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought

Be it our wives our children or ourselves

The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils

Till whenthe which I hope shall ne'er be seen

Your Grace is welcome to our town and us

Your shakes of fortune though they haunt you mortally

Yet glance full wond'ringly on us

Fear not my lord but think

Your Grace that fed my country with your corn

For which the people's prayers still fall upon you

Must in your child be thought on If neglection

Should therein make me vile the common body

By you relieved would force me to my duty

But if to that my nature need a spur

The gods revenge it upon me and mine

To the end of generation

We'll bring your Grace e'en to the edge o' th' shore

Then give you up to the maskd Neptune

And the gentlest winds of heaven

O Dionyza such a piece of slaughter

The sun and moon ne'er looked upon

Were I chief lord of all this spacious world

I'd give it to undo the deed A lady

Much less in blood than virtue yet a princess

To equal any single crown o' th' Earth

I' the justice of compare O villain Leonine

Whom thou hast poisoned too

If thou hadst drunk to him 't had been a kindness

Becoming well thy face What canst thou say

When noble Pericles shall demand his child

O go to Well well

Of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods

Do like this worst

To such proceeding

Whoever but his approbation added

Though not his prime consent he did not flow

From honorable courses

Heavens forgive it

Thou art like the Harpy

Which to betray dost with thine angel's face

Seize with thine eagle's talons
