Indeed distract her mood will needs be pitied

She speaks much of her father says she hears

There's tricks i' th' world and hems and beats her heart

Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt

That carry but half sense Her speech is nothing

Yet the unshapd use of it doth move

The hearers to collection They aim at it

And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts

Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them

Indeed would make one think there might be thought

Though nothing sure yet much unhappily
