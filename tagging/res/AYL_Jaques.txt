I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck

melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.

More, I prithee, more.

I do not desire you to please me. I do desire

you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you

’em “stanzos”?

Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me

nothing. Will you sing?

Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank

you. But that they call “compliment” is like th’

encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks

me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and

he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing. And

you that will not, hold your tongues.

And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is

too disputable for my company. I think of as many

matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no

boast of them. Come, warble, come.

Who doth ambition shun

And loves to live i’ th’ sun,

Seeking the food he eats

And pleased with what he gets,

Come hither, come hither, come hither.

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.

I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made

yesterday in despite of my invention.

Thus it goes:

If it do come to pass

That any man turn ass,

Leaving his wealth and ease

A stubborn will to please,

Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame.

Here shall he see

Gross fools as he,

An if he will come to me.

’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a

circle. I’ll go sleep if I can. If I cannot, I’ll rail

against all the first-born of Egypt.

A fool, a fool, I met a fool i’ th’ forest,

A motley fool. A miserable world!

As I do live by food, I met a fool,

Who laid him down and basked him in the sun

And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,

In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.

“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,

“Call me not ‘fool’ till heaven hath sent me fortune.”

And then he drew a dial from his poke

And, looking on it with lack-luster eye,

Says very wisely “It is ten o’clock.

Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.

’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,

And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.

And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,

And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,

And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear

The motley fool thus moral on the time,

My lungs began to crow like chanticleer

That fools should be so deep-contemplative,

And I did laugh sans intermission

An hour by his dial. O noble fool!

A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.

O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier,

And says “If ladies be but young and fair,

They have the gift to know it.” And in his brain,

Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit

After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed

With observation, the which he vents

In mangled forms. O, that I were a fool!

I am ambitious for a motley coat.

It is my only suit,

Provided that you weed your better judgments

Of all opinion that grows rank in them

That I am wise. I must have liberty

Withal, as large a charter as the wind,

To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.

And they that are most gallèd with my folly,

They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?

The “why” is plain as way to parish church:

He that a fool doth very wisely hit

Doth very foolishly, although he smart,

Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,

The wise man’s folly is anatomized

Even by the squand’ring glances of the fool.

Invest me in my motley. Give me leave

To speak my mind, and I will through and through

Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,

If they will patiently receive my medicine.

What, for a counter, would I do but good?

Why, who cries out on pride

That can therein tax any private party?

Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea

Till that the weary very means do ebb?

What woman in the city do I name

When that I say the city-woman bears

The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?

Who can come in and say that I mean her,

When such a one as she such is her neighbor?

Or what is he of basest function

That says his bravery is not on my cost,

Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits

His folly to the mettle of my speech?

There then. How then, what then? Let me see wherein

My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,

Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,

Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies

Unclaimed of any man.    But who comes here?

Why, I have eat none yet.

Of what kind should this cock come of?

An you will not be answered with reason, I

must die.

All the world’s a stage,

And all the men and women merely players.

They have their exits and their entrances,

And one man in his time plays many parts,

His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,

Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.

Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel

And shining morning face, creeping like snail

Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,

Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad

Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,

Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,

Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,

Seeking the bubble reputation

Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,

In fair round belly with good capon lined,

With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,

Full of wise saws and modern instances;

And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts

Into the lean and slippered pantaloon

With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,

His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide

For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,

Turning again toward childish treble, pipes

And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,

That ends this strange eventful history,

Is second childishness and mere oblivion,

Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

I thank you for your company,

but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.

God be wi’ you. Let’s meet as little as we can.

I pray you mar no more trees with writing love

songs in their barks.

Rosalind is your love’s name?

I do not like her name.

What stature is she of?

You are full of pretty answers. Have you not

been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives and

conned them out of rings?

You have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of

Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we

two will rail against our mistress the world and all

our misery.

The worst fault you have is to be in love.

By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I

found you.

There I shall see mine own figure.

I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good

Signior Love.

O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than

Jove in a thatched house.

A material fool.

I would fain see this meeting.

Proceed, proceed. I’ll give

her.

Will you be married, motley?

And will you, being a man of your breeding, be

married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to

church, and have a good priest that can tell you

what marriage is. This fellow will but join you

together as they join wainscot. Then one of you will

prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp,

warp.

Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better

acquainted with thee.

I am so. I do love it better than laughing.

Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.

I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which

is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical;

nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the

soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s,

which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor

the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy

of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted

from many objects, and indeed the sundry

contemplation of my travels, in which my often

rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.

Yes, I have gained my experience.

Nay then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank

verse.

Which is he that killed the deer?

Let’s present him to the

Duke like a Roman conqueror. And it would do well

to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of

victory.—Have you no song, forester, for this

purpose?

Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it

make noise enough.

There is sure another flood toward, and these

couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of

very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called

fools.

Good my lord, bid him welcome.

This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so

often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he

swears.

And how was that ta’en up?

How “seventh cause”?—Good my lord, like

this fellow.

But for the seventh cause. How did you find the

quarrel on the seventh cause?

And how oft did you say his beard was not well

cut?

Can you nominate in order now the degrees of

the lie?

Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?

He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.

Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,

The Duke hath put on a religious life

And thrown into neglect the pompous court.

To him will I. Out of these convertites

There is much matter to be heard and learned.

You to your former honor I bequeath;

Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.

You to a love that your true faith doth merit.

You to your land, and love, and great allies.

You to a long and well-deservèd bed.

And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage

Is but for two months victualled.—So to your pleasures.

I am for other than for dancing measures.

To see no pastime, I. What you would have

I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.
