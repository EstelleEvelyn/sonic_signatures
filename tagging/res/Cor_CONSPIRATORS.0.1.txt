So he did, my lord.

The army marvelled at it, and, in the last,

When he had carried Rome and that we looked

For no less spoil than glory—

Your native town you entered like a post

And had no welcomes home, but he returns

Splitting the air with noise.

Let him die for ’t.

Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
