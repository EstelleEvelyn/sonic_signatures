Good captain let me be th' interpreter

No sir I warrant you

E'en such as you speak to me

Boskos thromuldo boskos

Boskos vauvado I understand thee and

can speak thy tongue Kerelybonto sir betake thee

to thy faith for seventeen poniards are at thy

bosom

O pray pray pray Manka reuania

dulche

The General is content to spare thee yet

And hoodwinked as thou art will lead thee on

To gather from thee Haply thou mayst inform

Something to save thy life

But wilt thou faithfully

Acordo linta Come on thou art

granted space

He calls for the tortures

What will you say without 'em

Bosko Chimurcho

You are a merciful generalOur general

bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a

note

First demand of

him how many horse the Duke is strongWhat say

you to that

Shall I set down your answer so

Well that's set down

Well that's set down

Demand of him of

what strength they are o' footWhat say you to

that

Well that's set down

You shall demand of him whether

one Captain Dumaine be i' th' camp a Frenchman

what his reputation is with the Duke what his valor

honesty and expertness in wars or whether he

thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums

of gold to corrupt him to a revoltWhat say you to

this What do you know of it

Do you know this Captain Dumaine

Well is this captain in the Duke of

Florence's camp

What is his reputation with the Duke

Marry we'll search

Here 'tis here's a paper Shall I read it to

you

Dian the Count's a fool and full

of gold

Nay I'll read it first by your favor

When he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it

After he scores he never pays the score

Half won is match well made Match and well make it

He ne'er pays after-debts Take it before

And say a soldier Dian told thee this

Men are to mell with boys are not to kiss

For count of this the Count's a fool I know it

Who pays before but not when he does owe it

Thine as he vowed to thee in thine ear

Parolles

I perceive sir by our

general's looks we shall be fain to hang you

We'll see what may be done so you confess

freely Therefore once more to this Captain

Dumaine you have answered to his reputation

with the Duke and to his valor What is his

honesty

What say you to his expertness in war

His qualities being at this poor price

I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to

revolt

What's his brother the other Captain

Dumaine

What's he

If your life be saved will you undertake

to betray the Florentine

I'll whisper with the General and know

his pleasure

There is no remedy sir but you must

die The General says you that have so traitorously

discovered the secrets of your army and made

such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held

can serve the world for no honest use Therefore

you must dieCome headsman off with his

head

That shall you and take your leave of

all your friends So

look about you Know you any here

You are undone captainall but your

scarf that has a knot on 't yet

If you could find out a country where

but women were that had received so much

shame you might begin an impudent nation Fare

you well sir I am for France too We shall speak of

you there
