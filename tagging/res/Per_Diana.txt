


My temple stands in Ephesus Hie thee thither

And do upon mine altar sacrifice

There when my maiden priests are met together

Before the people all

Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife

To mourn thy crosses with thy daughter's call

And give them repetition to the life

Or perform my bidding or thou livest in woe

Do 't and happy by my silver bow

Awake and tell thy dream
