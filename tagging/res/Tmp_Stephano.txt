


I shall no more to sea to sea

Here shall I die ashore

This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral

Well here's my comfort

The master the swabber the boatswain and I

The gunner and his mate

Loved Mall Meg and Marian and Margery

But none of us cared for Kate

For she had a tongue with a tang

Would cry to a sailor Go hang

She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch

Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch

Then to sea boys and let her go hang

This is a scurvy tune too But here's my comfort

What's the matter Have we devils here Do

you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind

Ha I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now

of your four legs for it hath been said As proper a

man as ever went on four legs cannot make him

give ground and it shall be said so again while

Stephano breathes at' nostrils

This is some monster of the isle with four

legs who hath got as I take it an ague Where the

devil should he learn our language I will give him

some relief if it be but for that If I can recover him

and keep him tame and get to Naples with him

he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on

neat's leather

He's in his fit now and does not talk after

the wisest He shall taste of my bottle If he have

never drunk wine afore it will go near to remove

his fit If I can recover him and keep him tame I will

not take too much for him He shall pay for him that

hath him and that soundly

Come on your ways Open your mouth

Here is that which will give language to you cat

Open your mouth This will shake your shaking I

can tell you and that soundly You

cannot tell who's your friend Open your chaps

again

Four legs and two voicesa most delicate

monster His forward voice now is to speak well of

his friend His backward voice is to utter foul

speeches and to detract If all the wine in my bottle

will recover him I will help his ague Come

Amen I will pour some in thy

other mouth

Doth thy other mouth call me Mercy mercy

this is a devil and no monster I will leave him I

have no long spoon

If thou be'st Trinculo come forth I'll pull

thee by the lesser legs If any be Trinculo's legs

these are they

Thou art very Trinculo indeed How

cam'st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf Can

he vent Trinculos

Prithee do not turn me about My stomach

is not constant

How didst thou scape How

cam'st thou hither Swear by this bottle how thou

cam'st hitherI escaped upon a butt of sack which

the sailors heaved o'erboardby this bottle which

I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands

since I was cast ashore

Here Swear then how thou

escapedst

Here kiss the book

Though thou canst swim like a duck thou art made

like a goose

The whole butt man My cellar is in a rock

by th' seaside where my wine is hidHow now

mooncalf how does thine ague

Out o' th' moon I do assure thee I was the

man i' th' moon when time was

Come swear to that Kiss the book I will

furnish it anon with new contents Swear

Come on then Down and swear

more talkingTrinculo the King and all our

company else being drowned we will inherit here

Here bear my bottleFellow Trinculo we'll

fill him by and by again

O brave monster Lead the way

Tell not me When the butt is

out we will drink water not a drop before Therefore

bear up and board 'emServant monster

Drink servant monster when I bid thee

Thy eyes are almost set in thy head

My man-monster hath drowned his tongue

in sack For my part the sea cannot drown me I

swam ere I could recover the shore five-and-thirty

leagues off and on by this lightThou shalt be my

lieutenant monster or my standard

We'll not run Monsieur Monster

Mooncalf speak once in thy life if thou

be'st a good mooncalf

Trinculo keep a good tongue in your head

If you prove a mutineer the next tree The poor

monster's my subject and he shall not suffer

indignity

Marry will I Kneel and repeat it I will

stand and so shall Trinculo

Trinculo if you trouble him any more in 's

tale by this hand I will supplant some of your

teeth

Mum then and no more

Proceed

That's most certain

How now shall this be compassed Canst

thou bring me to the party

Trinculo run into no further danger Interrupt

the monster one word further and by this

hand I'll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a

stockfish of thee

Didst thou not say he lied

Do I so Take thou that

As you like this give me the lie another time

Now forward with your tale

Prithee stand further off

Stand farther

Come proceed

Is it so brave a lass

Monster I will kill this man His daughter

and I will be king and queensave our Graces

and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroysDost

But while thou liv'st keep a good tongue in thy

head

Ay on mine honor

At thy request monster I will do reason

Flout 'em and cout 'em

And scout 'em and flout 'em

man show thyself in thy likeness If thou be'st a

devil take 't as thou list

He that dies pays all debtsI defy thee

Mercy upon us

No monster not I

This will prove a brave kingdom to me

where I shall have my music for nothing

That shall be by and by I remember the

story

Lead monster We'll followI would I

could see this taborer He lays it on Wilt come

Monster your fairy which you say is a

harmless fairy has done little better than played the

jack with us

So is mineDo you hear monster If I

should take a displeasure against you look you

There is not only disgrace and dishonor in

that monster but an infinite loss

I will fetch off my bottle though I be o'er

ears for my labor

Give me thy hand I do begin to have bloody

thoughts

for 't Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king

of this country Steal by line and level is an excellent

pass of pate There's another garment for 't
