


Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am

mistress of and would you yet I were merrier

Unless you could teach me to forget a banished

father you must not learn me how to remember

any extraordinary pleasure

Well I will forget the condition of my estate

to rejoice in yours

From henceforth I will coz and devise

sports Let me seewhat think you of falling in

love

What shall be our sport then

I would we could do so for her benefits are

mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman

doth most mistake in her gifts to women

Nay now thou goest from Fortune's office to

Nature's Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in

the lineaments of nature

Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature

when Fortune makes Nature's natural the

cutter-off of Nature's wit

Where learned you that oath fool

Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom

With his mouth full of news

Then shall we be news-crammed

As wit and fortune will

Thou losest thy old smell

Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling

With bills on their necks Be it known unto

all men by these presents

Alas

But is there any else longs to see this broken

music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon

rib-breaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin

Is yonder the man

Ay my liege so please you give us leave

Young man have you challenged Charles the

wrestler

Do young sir Your reputation shall not

therefore be misprized We will make it our suit to

the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward

The little strength that I have I would it

were with you

Fare you well Pray heaven I be deceived in

you

Now Hercules be thy speed young man

O excellent young man

My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul

And all the world was of my father's mind

Had I before known this young man his son

I should have given him tears unto entreaties

Ere he should thus have ventured

 Gentleman

Wear this for meone out of suits with Fortune

That could give more but that her hand lacks means

Shall we go coz

He calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes

I'll ask him what he wouldDid you call sir

Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown

More than your enemies

Have with you Fare you well

Not one to throw at a dog

Then there were two cousins laid up when

the one should be lamed with reasons and the

other mad without any

No some of it is for my child's father O

how full of briers is this working-day world

I could shake them off my coat These burs

are in my heart

I would try if I could cry hem and have

him

O they take the part of a better wrestler

than myself

The Duke my father loved his father dearly

No faith hate him not for my sake

Let me love him for that and do you love

him because I do

Look here comes the Duke

Me uncle

I do beseech your Grace

Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me

If with myself I hold intelligence

Or have acquaintance with mine own desires

If that I do not dream or be not frantic

As I do trust I am notthen dear uncle

Never so much as in a thought unborn

Did I offend your Highness

Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor

Tell me whereon the likelihood depends

So was I when your Highness took his dukedom

So was I when your Highness banished him

Treason is not inherited my lord

Or if we did derive it from our friends

What's that to me My father was no traitor

Then good my liege mistake me not so much

To think my poverty is treacherous

I have more cause

That he hath not

Why whither shall we go

Alas what danger will it be to us

Maids as we are to travel forth so far

Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold

Were it not better

Because that I am more than common tall

That I did suit me all points like a man

A gallant curtal-ax upon my thigh

A boar-spear in my hand and in my heart

Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will

We'll have a swashing and a martial outside

As many other mannish cowards have

That do outface it with their semblances

I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page

And therefore look you call me Ganymede

But what will you be called

But cousin what if we assayed to steal

The clownish fool out of your father's court

Would he not be a comfort to our travel

O Jupiter how weary are my spirits

I could find in my heart to disgrace my

man's apparel and to cry like a woman but I must

comfort the weaker vessel as doublet and hose

ought to show itself courageous to petticoat Therefore

courage good Aliena

Well this is the Forest of Arden

Ay be so good Touchstone

Look you who comes here a young man and an old

in solemn talk

Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound

I have by hard adventure found mine own

Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of

Jove Jove this shepherd's passion

Is much upon my fashion

Peace fool He's not thy kinsman

Peace I say Good even to you friend

I prithee shepherd if that love or gold

Can in this desert place buy entertainment

Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed

Here's a young maid with travel much oppressed

And faints for succor

What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture

I pray thee if it stand with honesty

Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock

And thou shalt have to pay for it of us

From the east to western Ind

No jewel is like Rosalind

Her worth being mounted on the wind

Through all the world bears Rosalind

All the pictures fairest lined

Are but black to Rosalind

Let no face be kept in mind

But the fair of Rosalind

Out fool

Peace you dull fool I found

them on a tree

I'll graft it with you and

then I shall graft it with a medlar Then it will be

the earliest fruit i' th' country for you'll be rotten

ere you be half ripe and that's the right virtue of

the medlar

Peace Here comes my sister

reading Stand aside

O most gentle Jupiter what

tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners

withal and never cried Have patience

good people

O yes I heard them all and more too for

some of them had in them more feet than the verses

would bear

Ay but the feet were lame and could not

bear themselves without the verse and therefore

stood lamely in the verse

I was seven of the nine days out of the

wonder before you came for look here what I

found on a palm tree

I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras'

time that I was an Irish rat which I can hardly

remember

Is it a man

I prithee who

Nay but who is it

Nay I prithee now with most petitionary

vehemence tell me who it is

Good my complexion dost thou think

though I am caparisoned like a man I have a

doublet and hose in my disposition One inch of

delay more is a South Sea of discovery I prithee

tell me who is it quickly and speak apace I would

thou couldst stammer that thou might'st pour this

concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out

of a narrow-mouthed bottleeither too much at

once or none at all I prithee take the cork out of

thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings

Is he of God's making What manner of

man Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a

beard

Why God will send more if the man will be

thankful Let me stay the growth of his beard if

thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin

Nay but the devil take mocking Speak sad

brow and true maid

Orlando

Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet

and hose What did he when thou saw'st him What

said he How looked he Wherein went he What

makes he here Did he ask for me Where remains

he How parted he with thee And when shalt thou

see him again Answer me in one word

But doth he know that I am in this forest and

in man's apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the

day he wrestled

It may well be called Jove's tree when it

drops forth such fruit

Proceed

Though it be pity to see such a sight it well

becomes the ground

O ominous He comes to kill my heart

Do you not know I am a woman When I

think I must speak Sweet say on

'Tis he Slink by and note him

I will speak to him like a

saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave

with him Do you hear forester

I pray you what is 't

o'clock

Then there is no true lover

in the forest else sighing every minute and

groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of

time as well as a clock

By no means sir Time

travels in divers paces with divers persons I'll tell

you who time ambles withal who time trots withal

who time gallops withal and who he stands still

withal

Marry he trots hard with a

young maid between the contract of her marriage

and the day it is solemnized If the interim be but a

se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems the

length of seven year

With a priest that lacks Latin

and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one

sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other

lives merrily because he feels no painthe one

lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning

the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious

penury These time ambles withal

With a thief to the gallows

for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks

himself too soon there

With lawyers in the vacation

for they sleep between term and term and

then they perceive not how time moves

With this shepherdess my

sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe

upon a petticoat

As the cony that you see

dwell where she is kindled

I have been told so of many

But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught

me to speak who was in his youth an inland man

one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in

love I have heard him read many lectures against it

and I thank God I am not a woman to be touched

with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally

taxed their whole sex withal

There were none principal

They were all like one another as halfpence are

every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow

fault came to match it

No I will not cast away my

physic but on those that are sick There is a man

haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with

carving Rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon

hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth

deifying the name of Rosalind If I could meet

that fancy-monger I would give him some good

counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love

upon him

There is none of my uncle's

marks upon you He taught me how to know a man

in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are

not prisoner

A lean cheek which you

have not a blue eye and sunken which you have

not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a

beard neglected which you have notbut I pardon

you for that for simply your having in beard is a

younger brother's revenue Then your hose should

be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve

unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything

about you demonstrating a careless desolation But

you are no such man You are rather point-device in

your accouterments as loving yourself than seeming

the lover of any other

Me believe it You may as

soon make her that you love believe it which I

warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does

That is one of the points in the which women still

give the lie to their consciences But in good sooth

are you he that hangs the verses on the trees

wherein Rosalind is so admired

But are you so much in love

as your rhymes speak

Love is merely a madness

and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a

whip as madmen do and the reason why they are

not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so

ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I

profess curing it by counsel

Yes one and in this manner

He was to imagine me his love his mistress

and I set him every day to woo me at which time

would I being but a moonish youth grieve be

effeminate changeable longing and liking proud

fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears

full of smiles for every passion something and for

no passion truly anything as boys and women are

for the most part cattle of this color would now

like him now loathe him then entertain him then

forswear him now weep for him then spit at him

that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love

to a living humor of madness which was to forswear

the full stream of the world and to live in a

nook merely monastic And thus I cured him and

this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as

clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not

be one spot of love in 't

I would cure you if you

would but call me Rosalind and come every day to

my cote and woo me

Go with me to it and I'll

show it you and by the way you shall tell me where

in the forest you live Will you go

Nay you must call me

RosalindCome sister will you go

Never talk to me I will weep

But have I not cause to weep

His very hair is of the dissembling color

I' faith his hair is of a good color

And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the

touch of holy bread

But why did he swear he would come this

morning and comes not

Do you think so

Not true in love

You have heard him swear downright he

was

I met the Duke yesterday and had much

question with him He asked me of what parentage

I was I told him of as good as he So he laughed

and let me go But what talk we of fathers when

there is such a man as Orlando

O come let us remove

The sight of lovers feedeth those in love

Bring us to this sight and you shall say

I'll prove a busy actor in their play

And why I pray you Who might be your mother

That you insult exult and all at once

Over the wretched What though you have no beauty

As by my faith I see no more in you

Than without candle may go dark to bed

Must you be therefore proud and pitiless

Why what means this Why do you look on me

I see no more in you than in the ordinary

Of nature's sale-work'Od's my little life

I think she means to tangle my eyes too

No faith proud mistress hope not after it

'Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair

Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream

That can entame my spirits to your worship

You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her

Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain

You are a thousand times a properer man

Than she a woman 'Tis such fools as you

That makes the world full of ill-favored children

'Tis not her glass but you that flatters her

And out of you she sees herself more proper

Than any of her lineaments can show her

But mistress know yourself Down on your knees

And thank heaven fasting for a good man's love

For I must tell you friendly in your ear

Sell when you can you are not for all markets

Cry the man mercy love him take his offer

Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer

So take her to thee shepherd Fare you well

He's fall'n in love with your

foulness And she'll fall in love with

my anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee with

frowning looks I'll sauce her with bitter words

Why look you so upon me

I pray you do not fall in love with me

For I am falser than vows made in wine

Besides I like you not If you will know my house

'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by

Will you go sisterShepherd ply her hard

Come sisterShepherdess look on him better

And be not proud Though all the world could see

None could be so abused in sight as he

Come to our flock

They say you are a melancholy

fellow

Those that are in extremity

of either are abominable fellows and betray

themselves to every modern censure worse than

drunkards

Why then 'tis good to be a

post

A traveller By my faith you

have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold

your own lands to see other men's Then to have

seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes

and poor hands

And your experience makes

you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry

than experience to make me sadand to travel for

it too

Farewell Monsieur Traveller

Look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all

the benefits of your own country be out of love with

your nativity and almost chide God for making you

that countenance you are or I will scarce think you

have swam in a gondola

Why how now Orlando where have you been all

this while You a lover An you serve me such

another trick never come in my sight more

Break an hour's promise in

love He that will divide a minute into a thousand

parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a

minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him

that Cupid hath clapped him o' th' shoulder but I'll

warrant him heart-whole

Nay an you be so tardy

come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of

a snail

Ay of a snail for though he

comes slowly he carries his house on his heada

better jointure I think than you make a woman

Besides he brings his destiny with him

Why horns which such as

you are fain to be beholding to your wives for But

he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the

slander of his wife

And I am your Rosalind

Come woo me

woo me for now I am in a holiday humor and like

enough to consent What would you say to me now

an I were your very very Rosalind

Nay you were better speak

first and when you were gravelled for lack of

matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good

orators when they are out they will spit and for

lovers lackingGod warn usmatter the cleanliest

shift is to kiss

Then she puts you to entreaty

and there begins new matter

Marry that should you if I

were your mistress or I should think my honesty

ranker than my wit

Not out of your apparel and

yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind

Well in her person I say I

will not have you

No faith die by attorney

The poor world is almost six thousand years old

and in all this time there was not any man died in

his own person videlicet in a love cause Troilus

had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet

he did what he could to die before and he is one of

the patterns of love Leander he would have lived

many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it

had not been for a hot midsummer night for good

youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont

and being taken with the cramp was

drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age

found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies

Men have died from time to time and worms have

eaten them but not for love

By this hand it will not kill a

fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more

coming-on disposition and ask me what you will I

will grant it

Yes faith will I Fridays and

Saturdays and all

Ay and twenty such

Are you not good

Why then can one desire

too much of a good thingCome sister you shall

be the priest and marry usGive me your hand

OrlandoWhat do you say sister

You must begin Will you

Orlando

Ay but when

Then you must say I take

thee Rosalind for wife

I might ask you for your

commission but I do take thee Orlando for my

husband There's a girl goes before the priest and

certainly a woman's thought runs before her

actions

Now tell me how long you

would have her after you have possessed her

Say a day without the

ever No no Orlando men are April when they

woo December when they wed Maids are May

when they are maids but the sky changes when

they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a

Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen more clamorous

than a parrot against rain more newfangled than

an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I

will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain

and I will do that when you are disposed to be

merry I will laugh like a hyena and that when thou

art inclined to sleep

By my life she will do as I

do

Or else she could not have

the wit to do this The wiser the waywarder Make

the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the

casement Shut that and 'twill out at the keyhole

Stop that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the

chimney

Nay you might keep that

check for it till you met your wife's wit going to

your neighbor's bed

Marry to say she came to

seek you there You shall never take her without her

answer unless you take her without her tongue O

that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's

occasion let her never nurse her child

herself for she will breed it like a fool

Alas dear love I cannot lack

thee two hours

Ay go your ways go your

ways I knew what you would prove My friends told

me as much and I thought no less That flattering

tongue of yours won me 'Tis but one cast away and

so come death Two o'clock is your hour

By my troth and in good

earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty

oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of

your promise or come one minute behind your

hour I will think you the most pathetical break-promise

and the most hollow lover and the most

unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be

chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful

Therefore beware my censure and keep your

promise

Well time is the old justice

that examines all such offenders and let time try

Adieu

O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou

didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But

it cannot be sounded my affection hath an

unknown bottom like the Bay of Portugal

No that same wicked bastard of Venus that

was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born

of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses

everyone's eyes because his own are out let him be

judge how deep I am in love I'll tell thee Aliena I

cannot be out of the sight of Orlando I'll go find a

shadow and sigh till he come

How say you now Is it not past two o'clock

And here much Orlando

Patience herself would startle at this letter

And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all

She says I am not fair that I lack manners

She calls me proud and that she could not love me

Were man as rare as phoenix 'Od's my will

Her love is not the hare that I do hunt

Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well

This is a letter of your own device

Come come you are a fool

And turned into the extremity of love

I saw her hand She has a leathern hand

A freestone-colored hand I verily did think

That her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands

She has a huswife's handbut that's no matter

I say she never did invent this letter

This is a man's invention and his hand

Why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style

A style for challengers Why she defies me

Like Turk to Christian Women's gentle brain

Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention

Such Ethiop words blacker in their effect

Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter

She Phoebes me Mark how the tyrant writes

Art thou god to shepherd turned

That a maiden's heart hath burned

Can a woman rail thus

Why thy godhead laid apart

Warr'st thou with a woman's heart

Did you ever hear such railing

Whiles the eye of man did woo me

That could do no vengeance to me

Meaning me a beast

If the scorn of your bright eyne

Have power to raise such love in mine

Alack in me what strange effect

Would they work in mild aspect

Whiles you chid me I did love

How then might your prayers move

He that brings this love to thee

Little knows this love in me

And by him seal up thy mind

Whether that thy youth and kind

Will the faithful offer take

Of me and all that I can make

Or else by him my love deny

And then I'll study how to die

Do you pity him No he

deserves no pityWilt thou love such a woman

What to make thee an instrument and play false

strains upon thee Not to be endured Well go your

way to her for I see love hath made thee a tame

snake and say this to her that if she love me I

charge her to love thee if she will not I will never

have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a true

lover hence and not a word for here comes more

company

I am What must we understand by this

But to Orlando did he leave him there

Food to the sucked and hungry lioness

Was 't you he rescued

But for the bloody napkin

I would I were at home

I do so I confess it Ah

sirrah a body would think this was well-counterfeited

I pray you tell your brother how well I

counterfeited Heigh-ho

Counterfeit I assure you

So I do but i' faith I should

have been a woman by right

I shall devise something

But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him

Will you go

God save you

brother

O my dear Orlando how it

grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf

I thought thy heart had been

wounded with the claws of a lion

Did your brother tell you

how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me

your handkercher

O I know where you are

Nay 'tis true There was never anything so sudden

but the fight of two rams and Caesar's thrasonical

brag of I came saw and overcame For your

brother and my sister no sooner met but they

looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner

loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they

asked one another the reason no sooner knew the

reason but they sought the remedy and in these

degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage

which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent

before marriage They are in the very wrath

of love and they will together Clubs cannot part

them

Why then tomorrow I cannot

serve your turn for Rosalind

I will weary you then no

longer with idle talking Know of me thenfor

now I speak to some purposethat I know you are

a gentleman of good conceit I speak not this that

you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge

insomuch I say I know you are Neither do I labor

for a greater esteem than may in some little measure

draw a belief from you to do yourself good and

not to grace me Believe then if you please that I

can do strange things I have since I was three year

old conversed with a magician most profound in

his art and yet not damnable If you do love Rosalind

so near the heart as your gesture cries it out

when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry

her I know into what straits of fortune she is

driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear

not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes

tomorrow human as she is and without any

danger

By my life I do which I

tender dearly though I say I am a magician Therefore

put you in your best array bid your friends for

if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to

Rosalind if you will

Look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of

hers

I care not if I have It is my study

To seem despiteful and ungentle to you

You are there followed by a faithful shepherd

Look upon him love him he worships you

And I for no woman

And I for no woman

And so am I for no

woman

Why do you speak too

Why blame you me to love you

Pray you no more of this

'Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the

moon I will help you if I can

I would love you if I couldTomorrow

meet me all together I will marry

you if ever I marry woman and I'll be married

tomorrow I will satisfy you if ever I

satisfy man and you shall be married tomorrow

I will content you if what pleases you

contents you and you shall be married tomorrow

As you love Rosalind meet

As you love Phoebe meetAnd as I love

no woman I'll meet So fare you well I have left

you commands

Patience once more whiles our compact is urged

You say if I bring in your Rosalind

You will bestow her on Orlando here

And you say you will have her when I bring her

You say you'll marry me if I be willing

But if you do refuse to marry me

You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd

You say that you'll have Phoebe if she will

I have promised to make all this matter even

Keep you your word O duke to give your daughter

You yours Orlando to receive his daughter

Keep you your word Phoebe that you'll marry me

Or else refusing me to wed this shepherd

Keep your word Silvius that you'll marry her

If she refuse me And from hence I go

To make these doubts all even

To you I give myself for I am yours

To you I give myself for I am yours

I'll have no father if you be not he

I'll have no husband if you be not he

Nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she

It is not the fashion to see the lady the

epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see

the lord the prologue If it be true that good wine

needs no bush 'tis true that a good play needs no

epilogue Yet to good wine they do use good bushes

and good plays prove the better by the help of good

epilogues What a case am I in then that am neither

a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in

the behalf of a good play I am not furnished like a

beggar therefore to beg will not become me My

way is to conjure you and I'll begin with the

women I charge you O women for the love you

bear to men to like as much of this play as please

you And I charge you O men for the love you bear

to womenas I perceive by your simpering none

of you hates themthat between you and the

women the play may please If I were a woman I

would kiss as many of you as had beards that

pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths

that I defied not And I am sure as many as have

good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for

my kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewell
