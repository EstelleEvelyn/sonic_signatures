


Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves

For through this laund anon the deer will come

And in this covert will we make our stand

Culling the principal of all the deer

That cannot be The noise of thy crossbow

Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost

Here stand we both and aim we at the best

And for the time shall not seem tedious

I'll tell thee what befell me on a day

In this self place where now we mean to stand

Ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee

This is the quondam king Let's seize upon him

Forbear awhile we'll hear a little more

No for we were subjects but while you were king

We are true subjects to the King King Edward

We charge you in God's name and the King's

To go with us unto the officers
