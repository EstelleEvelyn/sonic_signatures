


A pox o' your throats Who makes

that noise there What are you

Away you rogue away I am

sleepy

How now Abhorson What's the news

with you

You rogue I have been drinking all night

I am not fitted for 't

Friar not I I have been drinking hard all

night and I will have more time to prepare me or

they shall beat out my brains with billets I will not

consent to die this day that's certain

I swear I will not die today for any man's

persuasion

Not a word If you have anything to say to

me come to my ward for thence will not I today
