
Was he mad sir

You are a merry gamester

My Lord Sands

You cannot show me

Not for that neither Here's the pang that pinches

His Highness having lived so long with her and she

So good a lady that no tongue could ever

Pronounce dishonor of herby my life

She never knew harm-doingO now after

So many courses of the sun enthroned

Still growing in a majesty and pomp the which

To leave a thousandfold more bitter than

'Tis sweet at first t' acquireafter this process

To give her the avaunt It is a pity

Would move a monster

O God's will Much better

She ne'er had known pomp though 't be temporal

Yet if that quarrel Fortune do divorce

It from the bearer 'tis a sufferance panging

As soul and body's severing

So much the more

Must pity drop upon her Verily

I swear 'tis better to be lowly born

And range with humble livers in content

Than to be perked up in a glist'ring grief

And wear a golden sorrow

By my troth and maidenhead

I would not be a queen

Nay good troth

No not for all the riches under heaven

No in truth

How you do talk

I swear again I would not be a queen

For all the world

My good lord

Not your demand it values not your asking

Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying

Now I pray God amen

I do not know

What kind of my obedience I should tender

More than my all is nothing nor my prayers

Are not words duly hallowed nor my wishes

More worth than empty vanities Yet prayers and wishes

Are all I can return 'Beseech your Lordship

Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience

As from a blushing handmaid to his Highness

Whose health and royalty I pray for

My honored lord

This is strange to me

Come you are pleasant

Good lady

Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy

And leave me out on 't Would I had no being

If this salute my blood a jot It faints me

To think what follows

The Queen is comfortless and we forgetful

In our long absence Pray do not deliver

What here you've heard to her
