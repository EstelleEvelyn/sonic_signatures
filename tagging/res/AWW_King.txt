


The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears

Have fought with equal fortune and continue

A braving war

Nay 'tis most credible We here receive it

A certainty vouched from our cousin Austria

With caution that the Florentine will move us

For speedy aid wherein our dearest friend

Prejudicates the business and would seem

To have us make denial

He hath armed our answer

And Florence is denied before he comes

Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see

The Tuscan service freely have they leave

To stand on either part

What's he comes here

Youth thou bear'st thy father's face

Frank nature rather curious than in haste

Hath well composed thee Thy father's moral parts

Mayst thou inherit too Welcome to Paris

I would I had that corporal soundness now

As when thy father and myself in friendship

First tried our soldiership He did look far

Into the service of the time and was

Discipled of the bravest He lasted long

But on us both did haggish age steal on

And wore us out of act It much repairs me

To talk of your good father In his youth

He had the wit which I can well observe

Today in our young lords but they may jest

Till their own scorn return to them unnoted

Ere they can hide their levity in honor

So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness

Were in his pride or sharpness if they were

His equal had awaked them and his honor

Clock to itself knew the true minute when

Exception bid him speak and at this time

His tongue obeyed his hand Who were below him

He used as creatures of another place

And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks

Making them proud of his humility

In their poor praise he humbled Such a man

Might be a copy to these younger times

Which followed well would demonstrate them now

But goers backward

Would I were with him He would always say

Methinks I hear him now his plausive words

He scattered not in ears but grafted them

To grow there and to bear Let me not live

This his good melancholy oft began

On the catastrophe and heel of pastime

When it was outLet me not live quoth he

After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff

Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses

All but new things disdain whose judgments are

Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies

Expire before their fashions This he wished

I after him do after him wish too

Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home

I quickly were dissolvd from my hive

To give some laborers room

I fill a place I know 'tHow long is 't count

Since the physician at your father's died

He was much famed

If he were living I would try him yet

Lend me an armThe rest have worn me out

With several applications Nature and sickness

Debate it at their leisure Welcome count

My son's no dearer

Farewell young lords These warlike principles

Do not throw from youAnd you my lords farewell

Share the advice betwixt you If both gain all

The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received

And is enough for both

No no it cannot be And yet my heart

Will not confess he owes the malady

That doth my life besiege Farewell young lords

Whether I live or die be you the sons

Of worthy Frenchmen Let higher Italy

Those bated that inherit but the fall

Of the last monarchysee that you come

Not to woo honor but to wed it When

The bravest questant shrinks find what you seek

That fame may cry you loud I say farewell

Those girls of Italy take heed of them

They say our French lack language to deny

If they demand Beware of being captives

Before you serve

FarewellCome hither to me

I'll fee thee to stand up

I would I had so I had broke thy pate

And asked thee mercy for 't

No

What her is this

Now good Lafew

Bring in the admiration that we with thee

May spend our wonder too or take off thine

By wond'ring how thou took'st it

Thus he his special nothing ever prologues

This haste hath wings indeed

Now fair one does your business follow us

I knew him

We thank you maiden

But may not be so credulous of cure

When our most learnd doctors leave us and

The congregated college have concluded

That laboring art can never ransom nature

From her inaidible estate I say we must not

So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope

To prostitute our past-cure malady

To empirics or to dissever so

Our great self and our credit to esteem

A senseless help when help past sense we deem

I cannot give thee less to be called grateful

Thou thought'st to help me and such thanks I give

As one near death to those that wish him live

But what at full I know thou know'st no part

I knowing all my peril thou no art

I must not hear thee Fare thee well kind maid

Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid

Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward

Art thou so confident Within what space

Hop'st thou my cure

Upon thy certainty and confidence

What dar'st thou venture

Methinks in thee some blessd spirit doth speak

His powerful sound within an organ weak

And what impossibility would slay

In common sense sense saves another way

Thy life is dear for all that life can rate

Worth name of life in thee hath estimate

Youth beauty wisdom courage all

That happiness and prime can happy call

Thou this to hazard needs must intimate

Skill infinite or monstrous desperate

Sweet practicer thy physic I will try

That ministers thine own death if I die

Make thy demand

Ay by my scepter and my hopes of heaven

Here is my hand The premises observed

Thy will by my performance shall be served

So make the choice of thy own time for I

Thy resolved patient on thee still rely

More should I question thee and more I must

Though more to know could not be more to trust

From whence thou cam'st how tended on but rest

Unquestioned welcome and undoubted blessed

Give me some help here hoIf thou proceed

As high as word my deed shall match thy deed

Go call before me all the lords in court

Sit my preserver by thy patient's side

And with this healthful hand whose banished sense

Thou hast repealed a second time receive

The confirmation of my promised gift

Which but attends thy naming

Fair maid send forth thine eye This youthful parcel

Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing

O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice

I have to use Thy frank election make

Thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake

Peruse them well

Not one of those but had a noble father

Make choice and see

Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me

Why then young Bertram take her She's thy wife

Know'st thou not Bertram

What she has done for me

Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed

'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which

I can build up Strange is it that our bloods

Of color weight and heat poured all together

Would quite confound distinction yet stands off

In differences so mighty If she be

All that is virtuous save what thou dislik'st

A poor physician's daughterthou dislik'st

Of virtue for the name But do not so

From lowest place whence virtuous things proceed

The place is dignified by th' doer's deed

Where great additions swell 's and virtue none

It is a dropsied honor Good alone

Is good without a name vileness is so

The property by what it is should go

Not by the title She is young wise fair

In these to nature she's immediate heir

And these breed honor That is honor's scorn

Which challenges itself as honor's born

And is not like the sire Honors thrive

When rather from our acts we them derive

Than our foregoers The mere word's a slave

Debauched on every tomb on every grave

A lying trophy and as oft is dumb

Where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb

Of honored bones indeed What should be said

If thou canst like this creature as a maid

I can create the rest Virtue and she

Is her own dower honor and wealth from me

Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose

My honor's at the stake which to defeat

I must produce my powerHere take her hand

Proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift

That dost in vile misprision shackle up

My love and her desert that canst not dream

We poising us in her defective scale

Shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know

It is in us to plant thine honor where

We please to have it grow Check thy contempt

Obey our will which travails in thy good

Believe not thy disdain but presently

Do thine own fortunes that obedient right

Which both thy duty owes and our power claims

Or I will throw thee from my care forever

Into the staggers and the careless lapse

Of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate

Loosing upon thee in the name of justice

Without all terms of pity Speak Thine answer

Take her by the hand

And tell her she is thine to whom I promise

A counterpoise if not to thy estate

A balance more replete

Good fortune and the favor of the King

Smile upon this contract whose ceremony

Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief

And be performed tonight The solemn feast

Shall more attend upon the coming space

Expecting absent friends As thou lov'st her

Thy love's to me religious else does err

We lost a jewel of her and our esteem

Was made much poorer by it But your son

As mad in folly lacked the sense to know

Her estimation home

My honored lady

I have forgiven and forgotten all

Though my revenges were high bent upon him

And watched the time to shoot

Praising what is lost

Makes the remembrance dear Well call him hither

We are reconciled and the first view shall kill

All repetition Let him not ask our pardon

The nature of his great offense is dead

And deeper than oblivion we do bury

Th' incensing relics of it Let him approach

A stranger no offender and inform him

So 'tis our will he should

What says he to your daughter Have you spoke

Then shall we have a match I have letters sent me

That sets him high in fame

I am not a day of season

For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail

In me at once But to the brightest beams

Distracted clouds give way So stand thou forth

The time is fair again

All is whole

Not one word more of the consumd time

Let's take the instant by the forward top

For we are old and on our quick'st decrees

Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of time

Steals ere we can effect them You remember

The daughter of this lord

Well excused

That thou didst love her strikes some scores away

From the great compt But love that comes too late

Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried

To the great sender turns a sour offense

Crying That's good that's gone Our rash faults

Make trivial price of serious things we have

Not knowing them until we know their grave

Oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust

Destroy our friends and after weep their dust

Our own love waking cries to see what's done

While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon

Be this sweet Helen's knell and now forget her

Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin

The main consents are had and here we'll stay

To see our widower's second marriage day

Now pray you let me see it for mine eye

While I was speaking oft was fastened to 't

This ring was mine and when I gave it Helen

I bade her if her fortunes ever stood

Necessitied to help that by this token

I would relieve her Had you that craft to reave her

Of what should stead her most

Plutus himself

That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine

Hath not in nature's mystery more science

Than I have in this ring 'Twas mine 'twas Helen's

Whoever gave it you Then if you know

That you are well acquainted with yourself

Confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement

You got it from her She called the saints to surety

That she would never put it from her finger

Unless she gave it to yourself in bed

Where you have never come or sent it us

Upon her great disaster

Thou speak'st it falsely as I love mine honor

And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me

Which I would fain shut out If it should prove

That thou art so inhuman'twill not prove so

And yet I know not Thou didst hate her deadly

And she is dead which nothing but to close

Her eyes myself could win me to believe

More than to see this ringTake him away

My forepast proofs howe'er the matter fall

Shall tax my fears of little vanity

Having vainly feared too little Away with him

We'll sift this matter further

I am wrapped in dismal thinkings

Upon his many protestations to marry me

when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won

me Now is the Count Rossillion a widower his

vows are forfeited to me and my honor's paid to him

He stole from Florence taking no leave and I follow

him to his country for justice Grant it me O king

In you it best lies Otherwise a seducer flourishes

and a poor maid is undone

Diana Capilet

The heavens have thought well on thee Lafew

To bring forth this discov'rySeek these suitors

Go speedily and bring again the Count

I am afeard the life of Helen lady

Was foully snatched

I wonder sir since wives are monsters to you

And that you fly them as you swear them lordship

Yet you desire to marry    What woman's that

Come hither count Do you know these women

Sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend

Till your deeds gain them Fairer prove your honor

Than in my thought it lies

What sayst thou to her

Methought you said

You saw one here in court could witness it

Find him and bring him hither

She hath that ring of yours

What ring was yours I pray you

Know you this ring This ring was his of late

The story then goes false you threw it him

Out of a casement

You boggle shrewdly Every feather starts you

Is this the man you speak of

Tell me sirrahbut tell me true I charge you

Not fearing the displeasure of your master

Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off

By him and by this woman here what know you

Come come to th' purpose Did he love this

woman

How I pray you

How is that

As thou art a knave and no knave What an

equivocal companion is this

But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st

Thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst

say they are married But thou art too fine in thy

evidence Therefore stand aside

This ring you say was yours

Where did you buy it Or who gave it you

Who lent it you

Where did you find it then

If it were yours by none of all these ways

How could you give it him

This ring was mine I gave it his first wife

Take her away I do not like her now

To prison with her and away with him

Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring

Thou diest within this hour

Take her away

I think thee now some common customer

Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while

She does abuse our ears To prison with her

Is there no exorcist

Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes

Is 't real that I see

Let us from point to point this story know

To make the even truth in pleasure flow

If thou be'st yet a fresh uncroppd flower

Choose thou thy husband and I'll pay thy dower

For I can guess that by thy honest aid

Thou kept'st a wife herself thyself a maid

Of that and all the progress more and less

Resolvedly more leisure shall express

All yet seems well and if it end so meet

The bitter past more welcome is the sweet
