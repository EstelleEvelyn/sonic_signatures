


He hath no friends but what are friends for fear

Which in his dearest need will fly from him

Unless I have mista'en his colors much

Which well I am assured I have not done

His regiment lies half a mile at least

South from the mighty power of the King

Upon my life my lord I'll undertake it

And so God give you quiet rest tonight
