


First it was usual with himevery day

It would infect his speechthat if the King

Should without issue die he'll carry it so

To make the scepter his These very words

I've heard him utter to his son-in-law

Lord Abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced

Revenge upon the Cardinal

He was brought to this

By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton

Sir a Chartreux friar

His confessor who fed him every minute

With words of sovereignty

Not long before your Highness sped to France

The Duke being at the Rose within the parish

Saint Laurence Poultney did of me demand

What was the speech among the Londoners

Concerning the French journey I replied

Men fear the French would prove perfidious

To the King's danger Presently the Duke

Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted

'Twould prove the verity of certain words

Spoke by a holy monk that oft says he

Hath sent to me wishing me to permit

John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour

To hear from him a matter of some moment

Whom after under the confession's seal

He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke

My chaplain to no creature living but

To me should utter with demure confidence

This pausingly ensued Neither the King nor 's heirs

Tell you the Dukeshall prosper Bid him strive

To gain the love o' th' commonalty the Duke

Shall govern England'

On my soul I'll speak but truth

I told my lord the Duke by th' devil's illusions

The monk might be deceived and that 'twas dangerous

For him to ruminate on this so far until

It forged him some design which being believed

It was much like to do He answered Tush

It can do me no damage adding further

That had the King in his last sickness failed

The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads

Should have gone off

I can my liege

Being at Greenwich

After your Highness had reproved the Duke

About Sir William Blumer

If quoth he I for this had been committed

As to the Tower I thought I would have played

The part my father meant to act upon

Th' usurper Richard who being at Salisbury

Made suit to come in 's presence which if granted

As he made semblance of his duty would

Have put his knife into him

After the Duke his father with the knife

He stretched him and with one hand on his dagger

Another spread on 's breast mounting his eyes

He did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor

Was were he evil used he would outgo

His father by as much as a performance

Does an irresolute purpose
