


O for a muse of fire that would ascend

The brightest heaven of invention

A kingdom for a stage princes to act

And monarchs to behold the swelling scene

Then should the warlike Harry like himself

Assume the port of Mars and at his heels

Leashed in like hounds should famine sword and fire

Crouch for employment But pardon gentles all

The flat unraisd spirits that hath dared

On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth

So great an object Can this cockpit hold

The vasty fields of France Or may we cram

Within this wooden O the very casques

That did affright the air at Agincourt

O pardon since a crookd figure may

Attest in little place a million

And let us ciphers to this great account

On your imaginary forces work

Suppose within the girdle of these walls

Are now confined two mighty monarchies

Whose high upreard and abutting fronts

The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder

Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts

Into a thousand parts divide one man

And make imaginary puissance

Think when we talk of horses that you see them

Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth

For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings

Carry them here and there jumping o'er times

Turning th' accomplishment of many years

Into an hourglass for the which supply

Admit me chorus to this history

Who prologue-like your humble patience pray

Gently to hear kindly to judge our play

Now all the youth of England are on fire

And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies

Now thrive the armorers and honor's thought

Reigns solely in the breast of every man

They sell the pasture now to buy the horse

Following the mirror of all Christian kings

With wingd heels as English Mercurys

For now sits Expectation in the air

And hides a sword from hilts unto the point

With crowns imperial crowns and coronets

Promised to Harry and his followers

The French advised by good intelligence

Of this most dreadful preparation

Shake in their fear and with pale policy

Seek to divert the English purposes

O England model to thy inward greatness

Like little body with a mighty heart

What might'st thou do that honor would thee do

Were all thy children kind and natural

But see thy fault France hath in thee found out

A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills

With treacherous crowns and three corrupted men

One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second

Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third

Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland

Have for the gilt of France O guilt indeed

Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France

And by their hands this grace of kings must die

If hell and treason hold their promises

Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton

Linger your patience on and we'll digest

Th' abuse of distance force a play

The sum is paid the traitors are agreed

The King is set from London and the scene

Is now transported gentles to Southampton

There is the playhouse now there must you sit

And thence to France shall we convey you safe

And bring you back charming the narrow seas

To give you gentle pass for if we may

We'll not offend one stomach with our play

But till the King come forth and not till then

Unto Southampton do we shift our scene

Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies

In motion of no less celerity

Than that of thought Suppose that you have seen

The well-appointed king at Dover pier

Embark his royalty and his brave fleet

With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning

Play with your fancies and in them behold

Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing

Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give

To sounds confused Behold the threaden sails

Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind

Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea

Breasting the lofty surge O do but think

You stand upon the rivage and behold

A city on th' inconstant billows dancing

For so appears this fleet majestical

Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow

Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy

And leave your England as dead midnight still

Guarded with grandsires babies and old women

Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance

For who is he whose chin is but enriched

With one appearing hair that will not follow

These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France

Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege

Behold the ordnance on their carriages

With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur

Suppose th' Ambassador from the French comes back

Tells Harry that the King doth offer him

Katherine his daughter and with her to dowry

Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms

The offer likes not and the nimble gunner

With linstock now the devilish cannon touches

And down goes all before them Still be kind

And eke out our performance with your mind

Now entertain conjecture of a time

When creeping murmur and the poring dark

Fills the wide vessel of the universe

From camp to camp through the foul womb of night

The hum of either army stilly sounds

That the fixed sentinels almost receive

The secret whispers of each other's watch

Fire answers fire and through their paly flames

Each battle sees the other's umbered face

Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs

Piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents

The armorers accomplishing the knights

With busy hammers closing rivets up

Give dreadful note of preparation

The country cocks do crow the clocks do toll

And the third hour of drowsy morning named

Proud of their numbers and secure in soul

The confident and overlusty French

Do the low-rated English play at dice

And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night

Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp

So tediously away The poor condemnd English

Like sacrifices by their watchful fires

Sit patiently and inly ruminate

The morning's danger and their gesture sad

Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats

Presenteth them unto the gazing moon

So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold

The royal captain of this ruined band

Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent

Let him cry Praise and glory on his head

For forth he goes and visits all his host

Bids them good morrow with a modest smile

And calls them brothers friends and countrymen

Upon his royal face there is no note

How dread an army hath enrounded him

Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color

Unto the weary and all-watchd night

But freshly looks and overbears attaint

With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty

That every wretch pining and pale before

Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks

A largesse universal like the sun

His liberal eye doth give to everyone

Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all

Behold as may unworthiness define

A little touch of Harry in the night

And so our scene must to the battle fly

Where O for pity we shall much disgrace

With four or five most vile and ragged foils

Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous

The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see

Minding true things by what their mock'ries be

Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story

That I may prompt them and of such as have

I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse

Of time of numbers and due course of things

Which cannot in their huge and proper life

Be here presented Now we bear the King

Toward Calais Grant him there There seen

Heave him away upon your wingd thoughts

Athwart the sea Behold the English beach

Pales in the flood with men wives and boys

Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep-mouthed sea

Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the King

Seems to prepare his way So let him land

And solemnly see him set on to London

So swift a pace hath thought that even now

You may imagine him upon Blackheath

Where that his lords desire him to have borne

His bruisd helmet and his bended sword

Before him through the city He forbids it

Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride

Giving full trophy signal and ostent

Quite from himself to God But now behold

In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought

How London doth pour out her citizens

The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort

Like to the senators of th' antique Rome

With the plebeians swarming at their heels

Go forth and fetch their conqu'ring Caesar in

As by a lower but by loving likelihood

Were now the general of our gracious empress

As in good time he may from Ireland coming

Bringing rebellion broachd on his sword

How many would the peaceful city quit

To welcome him Much more and much more cause

Did they this Harry Now in London place him

As yet the lamentation of the French

Invites the King of England's stay at home

The Emperor's coming in behalf of France

To order peace between them and omit

All the occurrences whatever chanced

Till Harry's back return again to France

There must we bring him and myself have played

The interim by remembering you 'tis past

Then brook abridgment and your eyes advance

After your thoughts straight back again to France

Thus far with rough and all-unable pen

Our bending author hath pursued the story

In little room confining mighty men

Mangling by starts the full course of their glory

Small time but in that small most greatly lived

This star of England Fortune made his sword

By which the world's best garden he achieved

And of it left his son imperial lord

Henry the Sixth in infant bands crowned King

Of France and England did this king succeed

Whose state so many had the managing

That they lost France and made his England bleed

Which oft our stage hath shown And for their sake

In your fair minds let this acceptance take
