Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach

Speak nephew were you by when it began

Many a morning hath he there been seen

With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew

Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs

But all so soon as the all-cheering sun

Should in the farthest east begin to draw

The shady curtains from Aurora's bed

Away from light steals home my heavy son

And private in his chamber pens himself

Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out

And makes himself an artificial night

Black and portentous must this humor prove

Unless good counsel may the cause remove

I neither know it nor can learn of him

Both by myself and many other friends

But he his own affections' counselor

Is to himselfI will not say how true

But to himself so secret and so close

So far from sounding and discovery

As is the bud bit with an envious worm

Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air

Or dedicate his beauty to the same

Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow

We would as willingly give cure as know

I would thou wert so happy by thy stay

To hear true shriftCome madam let's away

Not Romeo Prince he was Mercutio's friend

His fault concludes but what the law should end

The life of Tybalt

Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight

Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath

What further woe conspires against mine age

O thou untaught What manners is in this

To press before thy father to a grave

But I can give thee more

For I will ray her statue in pure gold

That whiles Verona by that name is known

There shall no figure at such rate be set

As that of true and faithful Juliet
