
What’s your Highness’ pleasure?

Yes, gracious madam.

Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing

But what indeed is honest to be done.

Yet have I fierce affections, and think

What Venus did with Mars.

As well as I can, madam.

No, Antony,

My mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled

With thine entirely.

Death of one person can be paid but once,

And that she has discharged. What thou wouldst do

Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake

Was “Antony, most noble Antony.”

Then in the midst a tearing groan did break

The name of Antony; it was divided

Between her heart and lips. She rendered life

Thy name so buried in her.

Dead.
