The better part of my affections would

Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still

Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,

Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;

And every object that might make me fear

Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt

Would make me sad.

Why then you are in love.

Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad

Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy

For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry

Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,

Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:

Some that will evermore peep through their eyes

And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper,

And other of such vinegar aspect

That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile

Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,

Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare you well.

We leave you now with better company.

’Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered,

And better in my mind not undertook.

And so will I.

The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke,

Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.

I never heard a passion so confused,

So strange, outrageous, and so variable

As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.

“My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter!

Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!

Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter,

A sealèd bag, two sealèd bags of ducats,

Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter,

And jewels—two stones, two rich and precious stones—

Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl!

She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.”

Let good Antonio look he keep his day,

Or he shall pay for this.

You were best to tell Antonio what you hear—

Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

I think he only loves the world for him.

I pray thee, let us go and find him out

And quicken his embracèd heaviness

With some delight or other.

Now, what news on the Rialto?

I would she were as lying a gossip in that as

ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe

she wept for the death of a third husband. But

it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing

the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,

the honest Antonio—O, that I had a title good

enough to keep his name company!—

Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he

hath lost a ship.

Let me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil

cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness

of a Jew.

How now, Shylock, what news among the

merchants?

And Shylock for his own part knew the bird

was fledge, and then it is the complexion of them

all to leave the dam.

Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these

years?

Here comes another of the tribe; a third

cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn

Jew.

It is the most impenetrable cur

That ever kept with men.

I am sure the Duke

Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
