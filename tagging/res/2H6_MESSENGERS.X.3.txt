The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland

And, with a puissant and a mighty power

Of gallowglasses and stout kerns,

Is marching hitherward in proud array,

And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,

His arms are only to remove from thee

The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor.
