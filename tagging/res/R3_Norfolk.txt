
Here, most gracious liege.

We must both give and take, my loving lord.

Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

I go, my lord.

I warrant you, my lord.

Arm, arm, my lord. The foe vaunts in the field.

A good direction, warlike sovereign.

This found I on my tent this morning.

My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.

After the battle let George Stanley die.
