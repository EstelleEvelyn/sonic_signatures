


Fellows in arms and my most loving friends

Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny

Thus far into the bowels of the land

Have we marched on without impediment

And here receive we from our father Stanley

Lines of fair comfort and encouragement

The wretched bloody and usurping boar

That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines

Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough

In your embowelled bosomsthis foul swine

Is now even in the center of this isle

Near to the town of Leicester as we learn

From Tamworth thither is but one day's march

In God's name cheerly on courageous friends

To reap the harvest of perpetual peace

By this one bloody trial of sharp war

All for our vantage Then in God's name march

True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings

Kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings

The weary sun hath made a golden set

And by the bright track of his fiery car

Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow

Sir William Brandon you shall bear my standard

Give me some ink and paper in my tent

I'll draw the form and model of our battle

Limit each leader to his several charge

And part in just proportion our small power

My Lord of Oxford you Sir William Brandon

And you Sir Walter Herbert stay with me

The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment

Good Captain Blunt bear my goodnight to him

And by the second hour in the morning

Desire the Earl to see me in my tent

Yet one thing more good captain do for me

Where is Lord Stanley quartered do you know

If without peril it be possible

Sweet Blunt make some good means to speak with him

And give him from me this most needful note

Good night good Captain Blunt Come gentlemen

Let us consult upon tomorrow's business

Into my tent The dew is raw and cold

All comfort that the dark night can afford

Be to thy person noble father-in-law

Tell me how fares our loving mother

Good lords conduct him to his regiment

I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap

Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow

When I should mount with wings of victory

Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen

O Thou whose captain I account myself

Look on my forces with a gracious eye

Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath

That they may crush down with a heavy fall

The usurping helmets of our adversaries

Make us Thy ministers of chastisement

That we may praise Thee in the victory

To Thee I do commend my watchful soul

Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes

Sleeping and waking O defend me still

Cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen

That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here

The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams

That ever entered in a drowsy head

Have I since your departure had my lords

Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered

Came to my tent and cried on victory

I promise you my soul is very jocund

In the remembrance of so fair a dream

How far into the morning is it lords

Why then 'tis time to arm and give direction

More than I have said loving countrymen

The leisure and enforcement of the time

Forbids to dwell upon Yet remember this

God and our good cause fight upon our side

The prayers of holy saints and wrongd souls

Like high-reared bulwarks stand before our faces

Richard except those whom we fight against

Had rather have us win than him they follow

For what is he they follow Truly gentlemen

A bloody tyrant and a homicide

One raised in blood and one in blood established

One that made means to come by what he hath

And slaughtered those that were the means to help him

A base foul stone made precious by the foil

Of England's chair where he is falsely set

One that hath ever been God's enemy

Then if you fight against God's enemy

God will in justice ward you as his soldiers

If you do sweat to put a tyrant down

You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain

If you do fight against your country's foes

Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire

If you do fight in safeguard of your wives

Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors

If you do free your children from the sword

Your children's children quits it in your age

Then in the name of God and all these rights

Advance your standards draw your willing swords

For me the ransom of my bold attempt

Shall be this cold corpse on the Earth's cold face

But if I thrive the gain of my attempt

The least of you shall share his part thereof

Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully

God and Saint George Richmond and victory

God and your arms be praised victorious friends

The day is ours the bloody dog is dead

Great God of heaven say amen to all

But tell me is young George Stanley living

What men of name are slain on either side

Inter their bodies as becomes their births

Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled

That in submission will return to us

And then as we have ta'en the sacrament

We will unite the white rose and the red

Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction

That long have frowned upon their enmity

What traitor hears me and says not Amen

England hath long been mad and scarred herself

The brother blindly shed the brother's blood

The father rashly slaughtered his own son

The son compelled been butcher to the sire

All this divided York and Lancaster

Divided in their dire division

O now let Richmond and Elizabeth

The true succeeders of each royal house

By God's fair ordinance conjoin together

And let their heirs God if Thy will be so

Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace

With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days

Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord

That would reduce these bloody days again

And make poor England weep in streams of blood

Let them not live to taste this land's increase

That would with treason wound this fair land's peace

Now civil wounds are stopped peace lives again

That she may long live here God say amen
