


Nay we must longer kneel I am a suitor

Thank your Majesty

That you would love yourself and in that love

Not unconsidered leave your honor nor

The dignity of your office is the point

Of my petition

I am solicited not by a few

And those of true condition that your subjects

Are in great grievance There have been commissions

Sent down among 'em which hath flawed the heart

Of all their loyalties wherein although

My good Lord Cardinal they vent reproaches

Most bitterly on you as putter-on

Of these exactions yet the King our master

Whose honor heaven shield from soil even he escapes not

Language unmannerlyyea such which breaks

The sides of loyalty and almost appears

In loud rebellion

No my lord

You know no more than others But you frame

Things that are known alike which are not wholesome

To those which would not know them and yet must

Perforce be their acquaintance These exactions

Whereof my sovereign would have note they are

Most pestilent to th' hearing and to bear 'em

The back is sacrifice to th' load They say

They are devised by you or else you suffer

Too hard an exclamation

I am much too venturous

In tempting of your patience but am boldened

Under your promised pardon The subjects' grief

Comes through commissions which compels from each

The sixth part of his substance to be levied

Without delay and the pretense for this

Is named your wars in France This makes bold mouths

Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze

Allegiance in them Their curses now

Live where their prayers did and it's come to pass

This tractable obedience is a slave

To each incensd will I would your Highness

Would give it quick consideration for

There is no primer baseness

I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham

Is run in your displeasure

My learnd Lord Cardinal

Deliver all with charity

If I know you well

You were the Duke's surveyor and lost your office

On the complaint o' th' tenants Take good heed

You charge not in your spleen a noble person

And spoil your nobler soul I say take heed

Yes heartily beseech you

God mend all

Sir I desire you do me right and justice

And to bestow your pity on me for

I am a most poor woman and a stranger

Born out of your dominions having here

No judge indifferent nor no more assurance

Of equal friendship and proceeding Alas sir

In what have I offended you What cause

Hath my behavior given to your displeasure

That thus you should proceed to put me off

And take your good grace from me Heaven witness

I have been to you a true and humble wife

At all times to your will conformable

Ever in fear to kindle your dislike

Yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry

As I saw it inclined When was the hour

I ever contradicted your desire

Or made it not mine too Or which of your friends

Have I not strove to love although I knew

He were mine enemy What friend of mine

That had to him derived your anger did I

Continue in my liking Nay gave notice

He was from thence discharged Sir call to mind

That I have been your wife in this obedience

Upward of twenty years and have been blessed

With many children by you If in the course

And process of this time you can report

And prove it too against mine honor aught

My bond to wedlock or my love and duty

Against your sacred person in God's name

Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt

Shut door upon me and so give me up

To the sharp'st kind of justice Please you sir

The King your father was reputed for

A prince most prudent of an excellent

And unmatched wit and judgment Ferdinand

My father King of Spain was reckoned one

The wisest prince that there had reigned by many

A year before It is not to be questioned

That they had gathered a wise council to them

Of every realm that did debate this business

Who deemed our marriage lawful Wherefore I humbly

Beseech you sir to spare me till I may

Be by my friends in Spain advised whose counsel

I will implore If not i' th' name of God

Your pleasure be fulfilled

Lord Cardinal

To you I speak

Sir

I am about to weep but thinking that

We are a queen or long have dreamed so certain

The daughter of a king my drops of tears

I'll turn to sparks of fire

I will when you are humble nay before

Or God will punish me I do believe

Induced by potent circumstances that

You are mine enemy and make my challenge

You shall not be my judge for it is you

Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me

Which God's dew quench Therefore I say again

I utterly abhor yea from my soul

Refuse you for my judge whom yet once more

I hold my most malicious foe and think not

At all a friend to truth

My lord my lord

I am a simple woman much too weak

T' oppose your cunning You're meek and humble-mouthed

You sign your place and calling in full seeming

With meekness and humility but your heart

Is crammed with arrogancy spleen and pride

You have by fortune and his Highness' favors

Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted

Where powers are your retainers and your words

Domestics to you serve your will as 't please

Yourself pronounce their office I must tell you

You tender more your person's honor than

Your high profession spiritual that again

I do refuse you for my judge and here

Before you all appeal unto the Pope

To bring my whole cause 'fore his Holiness

And to be judged by him

What need you note it Pray you keep your way

When you are called return Now the Lord help

They vex me past my patience Pray you pass on

I will not tarry no nor ever more

Upon this business my appearance make

In any of their courts

Take thy lute wench My soul grows sad with troubles

Sing and disperse 'em if thou canst Leave working

How now

Would they speak with me

Pray their Graces

To come near What can be their business

With me a poor weak woman fall'n from favor

I do not like their coming now I think on 't

They should be good men their affairs as righteous

But all hoods make not monks

Your Graces find me here part of a housewife

I would be all against the worst may happen

What are your pleasures with me reverend lords

Speak it here

There's nothing I have done yet o' my conscience

Deserves a corner Would all other women

Could speak this with as free a soul as I do

My lords I care not so much I am happy

Above a number if my actions

Were tried by ev'ry tongue ev'ry eye saw 'em

Envy and base opinion set against 'em

I know my life so even If your business

Seek me out and that way I am wife in

Out with it boldly Truth loves open dealing

O good my lord no Latin

I am not such a truant since my coming

As not to know the language I have lived in

A strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious

Pray speak in English Here are some will thank you

If you speak truth for their poor mistress' sake

Believe me she has had much wrong Lord Cardinal

The willing'st sin I ever yet committed

May be absolved in English

To betray me

My lords I thank you both for your good wills

You speak like honest men pray God you prove so

But how to make you suddenly an answer

In such a point of weight so near mine honor

More near my life I fearwith my weak wit

And to such men of gravity and learning

In truth I know not I was set at work

Among my maids full little God knows looking

Either for such men or such business

For her sake that I have beenfor I feel

The last fit of my greatnessgood your Graces

Let me have time and counsel for my cause

Alas I am a woman friendless hopeless

In England

But little for my profit Can you think lords

That any Englishman dare give me counsel

Or be a known friend 'gainst his Highness' pleasure

Though he be grown so desperate to be honest

And live a subject Nay forsooth My friends

They that must weigh out my afflictions

They that my trust must grow to live not here

They are as all my other comforts far hence

In mine own country lords

How sir

You tell me what you wish for both my ruin

Is this your Christian counsel Out upon you

Heaven is above all yet there sits a judge

That no king can corrupt

The more shame for you Holy men I thought you

Upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues

But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear you

Mend 'em for shame my lords Is this your comfort

The cordial that you bring a wretched lady

A woman lost among you laughed at scorned

I will not wish you half my miseries

I have more charity But say I warned you

Take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once

The burden of my sorrows fall upon you

You turn me into nothing Woe upon you

And all such false professors Would you have me

If you have any justice any pity

If you be anything but churchmen's habits

Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me

Alas has banished me his bed already

His love too long ago I am old my lords

And all the fellowship I hold now with him

Is only my obedience What can happen

To me above this wretchedness All your studies

Make me a curse like this

Have I lived thus longlet me speak myself

Since virtue finds no friendsa wife a true one

A woman I dare say without vainglory

Never yet branded with suspicion

Have I with all my full affections

Still met the King loved him next heav'n obeyed him

Been out of fondness superstitious to him

Almost forgot my prayers to content him

And am I thus rewarded 'Tis not well lords

Bring me a constant woman to her husband

One that ne'er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure

And to that woman when she has done most

Yet will I add an honor a great patience

My lord I dare not make myself so guilty

To give up willingly that noble title

Your master wed me to Nothing but death

Shall e'er divorce my dignities

Would I had never trod this English earth

Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it

You have angels' faces but heaven knows your hearts

What will become of me now wretched lady

I am the most unhappy woman living

Alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes

Shipwracked upon a kingdom where no pity

No friends no hope no kindred weep for me

Almost no grave allowed me like the lily

That once was mistress of the field and flourished

I'll hang my head and perish

Do what you will my lords and pray forgive me

If I have used myself unmannerly

You know I am a woman lacking wit

To make a seemly answer to such persons

Pray do my service to his Majesty

He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers

While I shall have my life Come reverend fathers

Bestow your counsels on me She now begs

That little thought when she set footing here

She should have bought her dignities so dear

O Griffith sick to death

My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth

Willing to leave their burden Reach a chair

So Now methinks I feel a little ease

Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou ledst me

That the great child of honor Cardinal Wolsey

Was dead

Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died

If well he stepped before me happily

For my example

Alas poor man

So may he rest His faults lie gently on him

Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him

And yet with charity He was a man

Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking

Himself with princes one that by suggestion

Tied all the kingdom Simony was fair play

His own opinion was his law I' th' presence

He would say untruths and be ever double

Both in his words and meaning He was never

But where he meant to ruin pitiful

His promises were as he then was mighty

But his performance as he is now nothing

Of his own body he was ill and gave

The clergy ill example

Yes good Griffith

I were malicious else

After my death I wish no other herald

No other speaker of my living actions

To keep mine honor from corruption

But such an honest chronicler as Griffith

Whom I most hated living thou hast made me

With thy religious truth and modesty

Now in his ashes honor Peace be with him

Patience be near me still and set me lower

I have not long to trouble theeGood Griffith

Cause the musicians play me that sad note

I named my knell whilst I sit meditating

On that celestial harmony I go to

Spirits of peace where are you Are you all gone

And leave me here in wretchedness behind you

It is not you I call for

Saw you none enter since I slept

No Saw you not even now a blessed troop

Invite me to a banquet whose bright faces

Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun

They promised me eternal happiness

And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel

I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly

Bid the music leave

They are harsh and heavy to me

You are a saucy fellow

Deserve we no more reverence

Admit him entrance Griffith But this fellow

Let me ne'er see again    If my sight fail not

You should be Lord Ambassador from the Emperor

My royal nephew and your name Capuchius

O my lord

The times and titles now are altered strangely

With me since first you knew me But I pray you

What is your pleasure with me

O my good lord that comfort comes too late

'Tis like a pardon after execution

That gentle physic given in time had cured me

But now I am past all comforts here but prayers

How does his Highness

So may he ever do and ever flourish

When I shall dwell with worms and my poor name

Banished the kingdomPatience is that letter

I caused you write yet sent away

Sir I most humbly pray you to deliver

This to my lord the King

In which I have commended to his goodness

The model of our chaste loves his young daughter

The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her

Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding

She is young and of a noble modest nature

I hope she will deserve welland a little

To love her for her mother's sake that loved him

Heaven knows how dearly My next poor petition

Is that his noble Grace would have some pity

Upon my wretched women that so long

Have followed both my fortunes faithfully

Of which there is not one I dare avow

And now I should not liebut will deserve

For virtue and true beauty of the soul

For honesty and decent carriage

A right good husband Let him be a noble

And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em

The last is for my menthey are the poorest

But poverty could never draw 'em from me

That they may have their wages duly paid 'em

And something over to remember me by

If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life

And able means we had not parted thus

These are the whole contents And good my lord

By that you love the dearest in this world

As you wish Christian peace to souls departed

Stand these poor people's friend and urge the King

To do me this last right

I thank you honest lord Remember me

In all humility unto his Highness

Say his long trouble now is passing

Out of this world Tell him in death I blessed him

For so I will Mine eyes grow dim Farewell

My lordGriffith farewellNay Patience

You must not leave me yet I must to bed

Call in more women When I am dead good wench

Let me be used with honor Strew me over

With maiden flowers that all the world may know

I was a chaste wife to my grave Embalm me

Then lay me forth Although unqueened yet like

A queen and daughter to a king inter me

I can no more
