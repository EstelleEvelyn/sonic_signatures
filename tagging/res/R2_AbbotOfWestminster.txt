


A woeful pageant have we here beheld

My lord

Before I freely speak my mind herein

You shall not only take the sacrament

To bury mine intents but also to effect

Whatever I shall happen to devise

I see your brows are full of discontent

Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears

Come home with me to supper I'll lay

A plot shall show us all a merry day
