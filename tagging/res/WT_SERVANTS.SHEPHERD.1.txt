the door you would never dance again after a tabor

and pipe no the bagpipe could not move you He

sings several tunes faster than you'll tell money He

utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's

ears grew to his tunes

He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes

No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves He

has the prettiest love songs for maids so without

bawdry which is strange with such delicate burdens

of dildos and fadings Jump her and thump

her And where some stretch-mouthed rascal

would as it were mean mischief and break a foul

gap into the matter he makes the maid to answer

Whoop do me no harm good man puts him off

slights him with Whoop do me no harm good

man

He hath ribbons of all the colors i' th' rainbow

points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia

can learnedly handle though they come to him by

th' gross inkles caddises cambrics lawnswhy

he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses

You would think a smock were a she-angel he so

chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the

square on 't

Master there is three carters

three shepherds three neatherds three swineherds

that have made themselves all men of hair

They call themselves saultiers and they have a

dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of

gambols because they are not in 't but they themselves

are o' th' mind if it be not too rough for

some that know little but bowling it will please

plentifully

One three of them by their own report sir

hath danced before the King and not the worst of

the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th'

square

Why they stay at door sir
