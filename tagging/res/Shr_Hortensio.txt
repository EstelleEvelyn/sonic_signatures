


Mates maid How mean you that No mates for you

Unless you were of gentler milder mold

From all such devils good Lord deliver us

Signior Baptista will you be so strange

Sorry am I that our goodwill effects

Bianca's grief

So will I Signior Gremio But a word I

pray Though the nature of our quarrel yet never

brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth

us both that we may yet again have access to our

fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love to

labor and effect one thing specially

Marry sir to get a husband for her sister

I say a husband

Tush Gremio Though it pass your patience

and mine to endure her loud alarums why

man there be good fellows in the world an a man

could light on them would take her with all faults

and money enough

Faith as you say there's small choice in

rotten apples But come since this bar in law

makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly

maintained till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter

to a husband we set his youngest free for a

husband and then have to 't afresh Sweet Bianca

Happy man be his dole He that runs fastest gets the

ring How say you Signior Gremio

How now what's the matter My old

friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio How

do you all at Verona

Alia nostra casa ben venuto molto

honorato signor mio PetruchioRise Grumio

rise We will compound this quarrel

Petruchio patience I am Grumio's pledge

Why this' a heavy chance 'twixt him and you

Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio

And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale

Blows you to Padua here from old Verona

Petruchio shall I then come roundly to thee

And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favored wife

Thou 'dst thank me but a little for my counsel

And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich

And very rich But thou 'rt too much my friend

And I'll not wish thee to her

Petruchio since we are stepped thus far in

I will continue that I broached in jest

I can Petruchio help thee to a wife

With wealth enough and young and beauteous

Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman

Her only fault and that is faults enough

Is that she is intolerable curst

And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure

That were my state far worser than it is

I would not wed her for a mine of gold

Her father is Baptista Minola

An affable and courteous gentleman

Her name is Katherina Minola

Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue

Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee

For in Baptista's keep my treasure is

He hath the jewel of my life in hold

His youngest daughter beautiful Bianca

And her withholds from me and other more

Suitors to her and rivals in my love

Supposing it a thing impossible

For those defects I have before rehearsed

That ever Katherina will be wooed

Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en

That none shall have access unto Bianca

Till Katherine the curst have got a husband

Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace

And offer me disguised in sober robes

To old Baptista as a schoolmaster

Well seen in music to instruct Bianca

That so I may by this device at least

Have leave and leisure to make love to her

And unsuspected court her by herself

Peace Grumio it is the rival of my love

Petruchio stand by awhile

Grumio mum God save you Signior Gremio

'Tis well And I have met a gentleman

Hath promised me to help me to another

A fine musician to instruct our mistress

So shall I no whit be behind in duty

To fair Bianca so beloved of me

Gremio 'tis now no time to vent our love

Listen to me and if you speak me fair

I'll tell you news indifferent good for either

Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met

Upon agreement from us to his liking

Will undertake to woo curst Katherine

Yea and to marry her if her dowry please

I promised we would be contributors

And bear his charge of wooing whatsoe'er

Sir a word ere you go

Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no

That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio

Sir let me be so bold as ask you

Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter

Sir you say well and well you do conceive

And since you do profess to be a suitor

You must as we do gratify this gentleman

To whom we all rest generally beholding

The motion's good indeed and be it so

Petruchio I shall be your ben venuto

For fear I promise you if I look pale

I think she'll sooner prove a soldier

Iron may hold with her but never lutes

Why no for she hath broke the lute to me

I did but tell her she mistook her frets

And bowed her hand to teach her fingering

When with a most impatient devilish spirit

Frets' call you these quoth she I'll fume with them

And with that word she struck me on the head

And through the instrument my pate made way

And there I stood amazd for a while

As on a pillory looking through the lute

While she did call me rascal fiddler

And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms

As had she studied to misuse me so

But wrangling pedant this is

The patroness of heavenly harmony

Then give me leave to have prerogative

And when in music we have spent an hour

Your lecture shall have leisure for as much

Sirrah I will not bear these braves of thine

You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune

Madam my instrument's in

tune

Madam 'tis now in tune

The bass is right 'Tis the base knave that jars

How fiery and forward our pedant is

Now for my life the knave doth court my love

Pedascule I'll watch you better yet

You may go walk and give me leave awhile

My lessons make no music in three parts

Madam before you touch the instrument

To learn the order of my fingering

I must begin with rudiments of art

To teach you gamut in a briefer sort

More pleasant pithy and effectual

Than hath been taught by any of my trade

And there it is in writing fairly drawn

Yet read the gamut of Hortensio

But I have cause to pry into this pedant

Methinks he looks as though he were in love

Yet if thy thoughts Bianca be so humble

To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale

Seize thee that list If once I find thee ranging

Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing

Sir to satisfy you in what I have said

Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching

Quick proceeders marry Now tell me I pray

You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca

Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio

Mistake no more I am not Litio

Nor a musician as I seem to be

But one that scorn to live in this disguise

For such a one as leaves a gentleman

And makes a god of such a cullion

Know sir that I am called Hortensio

See how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio

Here is my hand and here I firmly vow

Never to woo her more but do forswear her

As one unworthy all the former favors

That I have fondly flattered her withal

Would all the world but he had quite forsworn

For me that I may surely keep mine oath

I will be married to a wealthy widow

Ere three days pass which hath as long loved me

As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard

And so farewell Signior Lucentio

Kindness in women not their beauteous looks

Shall win my love and so I take my leave

In resolution as I swore before

Mistress what cheer

Signior Petruchio fie you are to blame

Come Mistress Kate I'll bear you company

That will not be in haste

I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown

God-a-mercy Grumio then he shall have

no odds

Tailor I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow

Take no unkindness of his hasty words

Away I say Commend me to thy master

Why so this gallant will command the sun

Say as he says or we shall never go

Petruchio go thy ways the field is won

He will make the man mad to make the woman of him

I do assure thee father so it is

Well Petruchio this has put me in heart

Have to my widow and if she be froward

Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward

For both our sakes I would that word were true

My widow says thus she conceives her tale

To her widow

That's my office

Confess confess Hath he not hit you here

Content what's the wager

Content

Who shall begin

Sirrah Biondello go and entreat my wife

To come to me forthwith

I am afraid sir

Do what you can yours will not be entreated

Now where's my wife

I know her answer

She will not

And so it is I wonder what it bodes

Now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrow
