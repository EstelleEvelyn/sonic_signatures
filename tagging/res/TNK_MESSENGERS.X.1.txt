
From the knights.

I will, sir,

And truly what I think. Six braver spirits

Than these they have brought, if we judge by the outside,

I never saw nor read of. He that stands

In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming,

Should be a stout man, by his face a prince—

His very looks so say him; his complexion

Nearer a brown than black—stern and yet noble—

Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers;

The circles of his eyes show fire within him,

And as a heated lion, so he looks.

His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining

Like ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong,

Armed long and round; and on his thigh a sword

Hung by a curious baldric, when he frowns

To seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience,

Was never soldier’s friend.

There’s another—

A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming

As great as any; fairer promises

In such a body yet I never looked on.

The same, my lord.

Are they not sweet ones?

Methinks,

Being so few, and well disposed, they show

Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-haired—

Not wanton white, but such a manly color

Next to an auburn; tough and nimble-set,

Which shows an active soul. His arms are brawny,

Lined with strong sinews—to the shoulder-piece

Gently they swell, like women new-conceived,

Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting

Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted still,

But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-eyed,

Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp

To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,

He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,

Nor takes none. He’s round-faced, and when he smiles

He shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier.

About his head he wears the winner’s oak,

And in it stuck the favor of his lady.

His age some six-and-thirty. In his hand

He bears a charging-staff embossed with silver.
