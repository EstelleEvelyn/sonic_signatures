
Faith my lord

I hear of none but the new proclamation

That's clapped upon the court gate

The reformation of our traveled gallants

That fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors

They must either

For so run the conditionsleave those remnants

Of fool and feather that they got in France

With all their honorable points of ignorance

Pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks

Abusing better men than they can be

Out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean

The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings

Short blistered breeches and those types of travel

And understand again like honest men

Or pack to their old playfellows There I take it

They may cum privilegio oui away

The lag end of their lewdness and be laughed at

Ay marry

There will be woe indeed lords The sly whoresons

Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies

A French song and a fiddle has no fellow

To the Cardinal's

Your Lordship is a guest too

That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed

A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us

His dews fall everywhere

O that your Lordship were but now confessor

To one or two of these

Faith how easy

Yes my lord

I do beseech your Grace for charity

If ever any malice in your heart

Were hid against me now to forgive me frankly

To th' waterside I must conduct your Grace

Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux

Who undertakes you to your end

Came you from the King my lord

I must to him too

Before he go to bed I'll take my leave

My lord I love you

And durst commend a secret to your ear

Much weightier than this work The Queen's in labor

They say in great extremityand feared

She'll with the labor end

Methinks I could

Cry the amen and yet my conscience says

She's a good creature and sweet lady does

Deserve our better wishes

Now sir you speak of two

The most remarked i' th' kingdom As for Cromwell

Besides that of the Jewel House is made Master

O' th' Rolls and the King's secretary further sir

Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments

With which the time will load him Th' Archbishop

Is the King's hand and tongue and who dare speak

One syllable against him

Many good nights my lord I rest your servant

I could not personally deliver to her

What you commanded me but by her woman

I sent your message who returned her thanks

In the great'st humbleness and desired your Highness

Most heartily to pray for her

So said her woman and that her suff'rance made

Almost each pang a death

This is about that which the Bishop spake

I am happily come hither

Come back What mean you

Sir
