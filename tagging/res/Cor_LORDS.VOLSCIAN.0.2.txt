


You are most welcome home

We have

Peace ho No outrage Peace

The man is noble and his fame folds in

This orb o' th' Earth His last offenses to us

Shall have judicious hearing Stand Aufidius

And trouble not the peace

Hold hold hold hold

Thou hast done a deed whereat valor will weep

His own impatience

Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame

Let's make the best of it
