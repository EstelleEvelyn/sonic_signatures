He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;

And now Ventidius is wealthy too,

Whom he redeemed from prison. All these

Owes their estates unto him.

How? Have they denied him?

Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him,

And does he send to me? Three? Humh!

It shows but little love or judgment in him.

Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,

Thrive, give him over. Must I take th’ cure upon me?

Has much disgraced me in ’t. I’m angry at him

That might have known my place. I see no sense for ’t

But his occasions might have wooed me first;

For, in my conscience, I was the first man

That e’er received gift from him.

And does he think so backwardly of me now

That I’ll requite it last? No.

So it may prove an argument of laughter

To th’ rest, and I ’mongst lords be thought a fool.

I’d rather than the worth of thrice the sum

Had sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake;

I’d such a courage to do him good. But now return,

And with their faint reply this answer join:

Who bates mine honor shall not know my coin.
