But by the grace of God and Hume’s advice,

Your Grace’s title shall be multiplied.

This they have promisèd: to show your Highness

A spirit raised from depth of underground

That shall make answer to such questions

As by your Grace shall be propounded him.

Hume must make merry with the Duchess’ gold.

Marry, and shall! But, how now, Sir John Hume?

Seal up your lips, and give no words but “mum”;

The business asketh silent secrecy.

Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch;

Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.

Yet have I gold flies from another coast—

I dare not say, from the rich cardinal

And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,

Yet I do find it so. For, to be plain,

They, knowing Dame Eleanor’s aspiring humor,

Have hirèd me to undermine the Duchess

And buzz these conjurations in her brain.

They say a crafty knave does need no broker,

Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal’s broker.

Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near

To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.

Well, so it stands; and thus I fear at last

Hume’s knavery will be the Duchess’ wrack,

And her attainture will be Humphrey’s fall.

Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.

Come, my masters. The Duchess, I tell you,

expects performance of your promises.

Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.
