dog and that is the next way to give poor jades the

bots This house is turned upside down since Robin

ostler died

I think this be the most villainous

house in all London road for fleas I am stung like a

tench

Why they will allow us ne'er a jordan

and then we leak in your chimney and your

chamber-lye breeds fleas like a loach

I have a gammon of bacon and two

races of ginger to be delivered as far as Charing

Cross

Ay when canst tell Lend me thy

lantern quoth he Marry I'll see thee hanged

first

Time enough to go to bed with a

candle I warrant thee Come neighbor Mugs

we'll call up the gentlemen They will along with

company for they have great charge
