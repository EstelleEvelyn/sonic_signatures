


Sir here's a woman would speak with you

I had rather forsooth go before you like a man

than follow him like a dwarf

Sir John Falstaff

My master Sir John is come in at your back

door Mistress Ford and requests your company

Ay I'll be sworn My master knows not of your

being here and hath threatened to put me into

everlasting liberty if I tell you of it for he swears

he'll turn me away

Mistress Ford Mistress Ford Here's Mistress

Page at the door sweating and blowing and looking

wildly and would needs speak with you

presently
