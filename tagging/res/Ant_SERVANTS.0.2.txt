As they pinch one another by the

disposition, he cries out “No more,” reconciles

them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink.

Why, this it is to have a name in great

men’s fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will

do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.

The gods forbid!
