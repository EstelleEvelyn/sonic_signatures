The Volsces are in arms

Then worthy Martius

Attend upon Cominius to these wars

Your company to th' Capitol where I know

Our greatest friends attend us

Hence to your homes begone

Speak good Cominius

Leave nothing out for length and make us think

Rather our state's defective for requital

Than we to stretch it out Masters o' th' people

We do request your kindest ears and after

Your loving motion toward the common body

To yield what passes here

Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear

What you have nobly done

He cannot but with measure fit the honors

Which we devise him

Call Coriolanus

To Coriolanus come all joy and honor

Tribunes give way He shall to th' marketplace

Not in this heat sir now

No more words we beseech you

We'll surety him

Peace peace peace Stay hold peace

To unbuild the city and to lay all flat

The gods forbid

I prithee noble friend home to thy house

Leave us to cure this cause

This man has marred his fortune

I would they were abed

Noble tribunes

It is the humane way the other course

Will prove too bloody and the end of it

Unknown to the beginning

Pray you let's to him

There's no remedy

Unless by not so doing our good city

Cleave in the midst and perish

Amen amen

Behold our patroness the life of Rome

Call all your tribes together praise the gods

And make triumphant fires Strew flowers before them

Unshout the noise that banished Martius

Repeal him with the welcome of his mother

Cry Welcome ladies welcome

Welcome ladies welcome
