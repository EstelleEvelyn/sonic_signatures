A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit

our mystery.

Ay, sir, a mystery.

Sir, it is a mystery.

Every true man’s apparel fits your thief. If it

be too little for your thief, your true man thinks it

big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your thief

thinks it little enough. So every true man’s apparel

fits your thief.

Come on, bawd. I will instruct

thee in my trade. Follow.

Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

What ho, Barnardine!

Tell him he must awake, and

that quickly too.

Go in to him, and fetch him out.

Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into

your prayers, for, look you, the warrant’s come.

Look you, sir, here comes

your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think you?
