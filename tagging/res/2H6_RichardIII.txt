


And if words will not, then our weapons shall.

Oft have I seen a hot o’erweening cur

Run back and bite because he was withheld,

Who, being suffered with the bear’s fell paw,

Hath clapped his tail between his legs and cried;

And such a piece of service will you do

If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.

Fie! Charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,

For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight.

If not in heaven, you’ll surely sup in hell.

So lie thou there.

For underneath an alehouse’ paltry sign,

The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset

Hath made the wizard famous in his death.

Sword, hold thy temper! Heart, be wrathful still!

Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.

My noble father,

Three times today I holp him to his horse,

Three times bestrid him. Thrice I led him off,

Persuaded him from any further act;

But still, where danger was, still there I met him,

And, like rich hangings in a homely house,

So was his will in his old feeble body.

But, noble as he is, look where he comes.

Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today!
