
I thank your Grace,

Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer

Of what I saw there.

’Twixt Guynes and Arde.

I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,

Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung

In their embracement, as they grew together—

Which had they, what four throned ones could have weighed

Such a compounded one?

Then you lost

The view of earthly glory. Men might say

Till this time pomp was single, but now married

To one above itself. Each following day

Became the next day’s master, till the last

Made former wonders its. Today the French,

All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,

Shone down the English, and tomorrow they

Made Britain India: every man that stood

Showed like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were

As cherubins, all gilt. The madams too,

Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear

The pride upon them, that their very labor

Was to them as a painting. Now this masque

Was cried incomparable; and th’ ensuing night

Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,

Equal in luster, were now best, now worst,

As presence did present them: him in eye

Still him in praise; and being present both,

’Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner

Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns—

For so they phrase ’em—by their heralds challenged

The noble spirits to arms, they did perform

Beyond thought’s compass, that former fabulous story,

Being now seen possible enough, got credit

That Bevis was believed.

As I belong to worship, and affect

In honor honesty, the tract of everything

Would by a good discourser lose some life

Which action’s self was tongue to. All was royal;

To the disposing of it naught rebelled.

Order gave each thing view. The office did

Distinctly his full function.

One, certes, that promises no element

In such a business.

All this was ordered by the good discretion

Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.

Surely, sir,

There’s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;

For, being not propped by ancestry, whose grace

Chalks successors their way, nor called upon

For high feats done to th’ crown, neither allied

To eminent assistants, but spiderlike,

Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note

The force of his own merit makes his way—

A gift that heaven gives for him which buys

A place next to the King.

Grievingly I think

The peace between the French and us not values

The cost that did conclude it.

Which is budded out,

For France hath flawed the league and hath attached

Our merchants’ goods at Bordeaux.

Marry, is ’t.

Like it your Grace,

The state takes notice of the private difference

Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you—

And take it from a heart that wishes towards you

Honor and plenteous safety—that you read

The Cardinal’s malice and his potency

Together; to consider further that

What his high hatred would effect wants not

A minister in his power. You know his nature,

That he’s revengeful, and I know his sword

Hath a sharp edge; it’s long, and ’t may be said

It reaches far, and where ’twill not extend,

Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel;

You’ll find it wholesome. Lo where comes that rock

That I advise your shunning.

What, are you chafed?

Ask God for temp’rance. That’s th’ appliance only

Which your disease requires.

Stay, my lord,

And let your reason with your choler question

What ’tis you go about. To climb steep hills

Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like

A full hot horse who, being allowed his way,

Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England

Can advise me like you; be to yourself

As you would to your friend.

Be advised.

Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot

That it do singe yourself. We may outrun

By violent swiftness that which we run at

And lose by overrunning. Know you not

The fire that mounts the liquor till ’t run o’er

In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised.

I say again there is no English soul

More stronger to direct you than yourself,

If with the sap of reason you would quench

Or but allay the fire of passion.

Say not “treasonous.”

Faith, and so it did.

I am sorry

To hear this of him, and could wish he were

Something mistaken in ’t.

Not “almost appears”—

It doth appear. For, upon these taxations,

The clothiers all, not able to maintain

The many to them longing, have put off

The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,

Unfit for other life, compelled by hunger

And lack of other means, in desperate manner

Daring th’ event to th’ teeth, are all in uproar,

And danger serves among them.

Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.

What’s the cause?

’Tis so;

This is the Cardinal’s doing. The king-cardinal,

That blind priest, like the eldest son of Fortune,

Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.

How holily he works in all his business,

And with what zeal! For, now he has cracked the league

Between us and the Emperor, the Queen’s great-nephew,

He dives into the King’s soul and there scatters

Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,

Fears and despairs—and all these for his marriage.

And out of all these to restore the King,

He counsels a divorce, a loss of her

That like a jewel has hung twenty years

About his neck, yet never lost her luster;

Of her that loves him with that excellence

That angels love good men with; even of her

That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,

Will bless the King. And is not this course pious?

We had need pray,

And heartily, for our deliverance,

Or this imperious man will work us all

From princes into pages. All men’s honors

Lie like one lump before him, to be fashioned

Into what pitch he please.

Let’s in,

And with some other business put the King

From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him.—

My lord, you’ll bear us company?

Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.

Pray God he be not angry.

A gracious king that pardons all offenses

Malice ne’er meant. Our breach of duty this way

Is business of estate, in which we come

To know your royal pleasure.

This priest has no pride in him?

If it do,

I’ll venture one have-at-him.

If you will now unite in your complaints

And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal

Cannot stand under them. If you omit

The offer of this time, I cannot promise

But that you shall sustain more new disgraces

With these you bear already.

O, fear him not.

His spell in that is out. The King hath found

Matter against him that forever mars

The honey of his language. No, he’s settled,

Not to come off, in his displeasure.

Believe it, this is true.

In the divorce his contrary proceedings

Are all unfolded, wherein he appears

As I would wish mine enemy.

All men’s.

Marry, amen!

But, my lord,

When returns Cranmer?

This same Cranmer’s

A worthy fellow, and hath ta’en much pain

In the King’s business.

So I hear.

Observe, observe; he’s moody.

He’s discontented.

He is vexed at something.

My lord, we have

Stood here observing him. Some strange commotion

Is in his brain. He bites his lip, and starts,

Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,

Then lays his finger on his temple, straight

Springs out into fast gait, then stops again,

Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts

His eye against the moon. In most strange postures

We have seen him set himself.

It’s heaven’s will!

Some spirit put this paper in the packet

To bless your eye withal.

Hear the King’s pleasure, cardinal, who commands you

To render up the great seal presently

Into our hands, and to confine yourself

To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester’s,

Till you hear further from his Highness.

Those articles, my lord, are in the King’s hand;

But thus much, they are foul ones.

Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else

To foreign princes, “ego et rex meus”

Was still inscribed, in which you brought the King

To be your servant.

And so we’ll leave you to your meditations

How to live better. For your stubborn answer

About the giving back the great seal to us,

The King shall know it and, no doubt, shall thank you.

So, fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.

Who waits there?

We are.

Do you think, my lords,

The King will suffer but the little finger

Of this man to be vexed?
