


I am much bounden to your Majesty

So well that what you bid me undertake

Though that my death were adjunct to my act

By heaven I would do it

And I'll keep him so

That he shall not offend your Majesty

My lord

He shall not live

Heat me these irons hot and look thou stand

Within the arras When I strike my foot

Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth

And bind the boy which you shall find with me

Fast to the chair Be heedful Hence and watch

Uncleanly scruples fear not you Look to 't

Young lad come forth I have to say with you

Good morrow little prince

Indeed I have been merrier

If I talk to him with his innocent prate

He will awake my mercy which lies dead

Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch

His words do take possession of my bosom

Read here young Arthur How now foolish rheum

Turning dispiteous torture out of door

I must be brief lest resolution drop

Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears

Can you not read it Is it not fair writ

Young boy I must

And I will

I have sworn to do it

And with hot irons must I burn them out

Come forth

Do as I bid you do

Give me the iron I say and bind him here

Go stand within Let me alone with him

Come boy prepare yourself

None but to lose your eyes

Is this your promise Go to hold your tongue

 I can heat it boy

But with my breath I can revive it boy

Well see to live I will not touch thine eye

For all the treasure that thine uncle owes

Yet am I sworn and I did purpose boy

With this same very iron to burn them out

Peace No more Adieu

Your uncle must not know but you are dead

I'll fill these doggd spies with false reports

And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure

That Hubert for the wealth of all the world

Will not offend thee

Silence No more Go closely in with me

Much danger do I undergo for thee

My lord they say five moons were seen tonight

Four fixd and the fifth did whirl about

The other four in wondrous motion

Old men and beldams in the streets

Do prophesy upon it dangerously

Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths

And when they talk of him they shake their heads

And whisper one another in the ear

And he that speaks doth grip the hearer's wrist

Whilst he that hears makes fearful action

With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes

I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus

The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool

With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news

Who with his shears and measure in his hand

Standing on slippers which his nimble haste

Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet

Told of a many thousand warlike French

That were embattld and ranked in Kent

Another lean unwashed artificer

Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death

No had my lord Why did you not provoke me

Here is your hand and seal for what I did

My lord

Arm you against your other enemies

I'll make a peace between your soul and you

Young Arthur is alive This hand of mine

Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand

Not painted with the crimson spots of blood

Within this bosom never entered yet

The dreadful motion of a murderous thought

And you have slandered nature in my form

Which howsoever rude exteriorly

Is yet the cover of a fairer mind

Than to be butcher of an innocent child

Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you

Arthur doth live the King hath sent for you

I am no villain

Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say

By heaven I think my sword's as sharp as yours

I would not have you lord forget yourself

Nor tempt the danger of my true defense

Lest I by marking of your rage forget

Your worth your greatness and nobility

Not for my life But yet I dare defend

My innocent life against an emperor

Do not prove me so

Yet I am none Whose tongue soe'er speaks false

Not truly speaks Who speaks not truly lies

Lord Bigot I am none

'Tis not an hour since I left him well

I honored him I loved him and will weep

My date of life out for his sweet life's loss

Do but hear me sir

Upon my soul

If I in act consent or sin of thought

Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath

Which was embounded in this beauteous clay

Let hell want pains enough to torture me

I left him well

Badly I fear How fares your Majesty

Who's there Speak ho Speak quickly or I shoot

Of the part of England

What's that to thee

Thou hast a perfect thought

I will upon all hazards well believe

Thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well

Who art thou

Unkind remembrance Thou and endless night

Have done me shame Brave soldier pardon me

That any accent breaking from thy tongue

Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear

Why here walk I in the black brow of night

To find you out

O my sweet sir news fitting to the night

Black fearful comfortless and horrible

The King I fear is poisoned by a monk

I left him almost speechless and broke out

To acquaint you with this evil that you might

The better arm you to the sudden time

Than if you had at leisure known of this

A monk I tell you a resolvd villain

Whose bowels suddenly burst out The King

Yet speaks and peradventure may recover

Why know you not The lords are all come back

And brought Prince Henry in their company

At whose request the King hath pardoned them

And they are all about his Majesty
