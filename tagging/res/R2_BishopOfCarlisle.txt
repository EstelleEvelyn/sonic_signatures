


Fear not my lord That power that made you king

Hath power to keep you king in spite of all

The means that heavens yield must be embraced

And not neglected Else heaven would

And we will notheaven's offer we refuse

The proffered means of succor and redress

My lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes

But presently prevent the ways to wail

To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength

Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe

And so your follies fight against yourself

Fear and be slainno worse can come to fight

And fight and die is death destroying death

Where fearing dying pays death servile breath

That honorable day shall never be seen

Many a time hath banished Norfolk fought

For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field

Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross

Against black pagans Turks and Saracens

And toiled with works of war retired himself

To Italy and there at Venice gave

His body to that pleasant country's earth

And his pure soul unto his captain Christ

Under whose colors he had fought so long

As surely as I live my lord

Marry God forbid

Worst in this royal presence may I speak

Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth

Would God that any in this noble presence

Were enough noble to be upright judge

Of noble Richard Then true noblesse would

Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong

What subject can give sentence on his king

And who sits here that is not Richard's subject

Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear

Although apparent guilt be seen in them

And shall the figure of God's majesty

His captain steward deputy elect

Anointed crowned planted many years

Be judged by subject and inferior breath

And he himself not present O forfend it God

That in a Christian climate souls refined

Should show so heinous black obscene a deed

I speak to subjects and a subject speaks

Stirred up by God thus boldly for his king

My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king

Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king

And if you crown him let me prophesy

The blood of English shall manure the ground

And future ages groan for this foul act

Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels

And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars

Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound

Disorder horror fear and mutiny

Shall here inhabit and this land be called

The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls

O if you raise this house against this house

It will the woefullest division prove

That ever fell upon this cursd earth

Prevent it resist it let it not be so

Lest child child's children cry against you woe

The woe's to come The children yet unborn

Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
