In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Where the place?

I come, Graymalkin.

Fair is foul, and foul is fair;

Hover through the fog and filthy air.

Where hast thou been, sister?

A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap

And munched and munched and munched. “Give me,” quoth I.

“Aroint thee, witch,” the rump-fed runnion cries.

Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ Tiger;

But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,

And, like a rat without a tail,

I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do.

Th’ art kind.

I myself have all the other,

And the very ports they blow;

All the quarters that they know

I’ th’ shipman’s card.

I’ll drain him dry as hay.

Sleep shall neither night nor day

Hang upon his penthouse lid.

He shall live a man forbid.

Weary sev’nnights, nine times nine,

Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.

Though his bark cannot be lost,

Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.

Look what I have.

Here I have a pilot’s thumb,

Wracked as homeward he did come.

The Weïrd Sisters, hand in hand,

Posters of the sea and land,

Thus do go about, about,

Thrice to thine and thrice to mine

And thrice again, to make up nine.

Peace, the charm’s wound up.

All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!

Hail!

Lesser than Macbeth and greater.

Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.

Come, let’s make haste. She’ll soon be back again.

Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.

Round about the cauldron go;

In the poisoned entrails throw.

Toad, that under cold stone

Days and nights has thirty-one

Sweltered venom sleeping got,

Boil thou first i’ th’ charmèd pot.

Double, double toil and trouble;

Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

Double, double toil and trouble;

Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

Double, double toil and trouble;

Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

A deed without a name.

Speak.

Say if th’ hadst rather hear it from our mouths

Or from our masters’.

Pour in sow’s blood that hath eaten

Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten

From the murderers’ gibbet throw

Into the flame.

Come high or low;

Thyself and office deftly show.

He knows thy thought.

Hear his speech but say thou naught.

He will not be commanded. Here’s another

More potent than the first.

Listen but speak not to ’t.

Seek to know no more.

Show.

Show his eyes and grieve his heart.

Come like shadows; so depart.

Ay, sir, all this is so. But why

Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?

Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites

And show the best of our delights.

I’ll charm the air to give a sound

While you perform your antic round,

That this great king may kindly say

Our duties did his welcome pay.
