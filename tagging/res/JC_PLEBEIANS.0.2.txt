I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons

When severally we hear them renderèd.

None, Brutus, none.

Live, Brutus, live, live!

Give him a statue with his ancestors.

Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.

We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up.

Peace, let us hear what Antony can say.

Peace, ho! Let us hear him.

If thou consider rightly of the matter,

Caesar has had great wrong.

Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.

The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.

You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.

The will! The testament!

They were villains, murderers. The

will! Read the will.

Come down.

Descend.

Room for Antony, most noble Antony.

Stand back! Room! Bear back!

O noble Caesar!

We will be revenged.

Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!

Slay! Let not a traitor live!

We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him,

we’ll die with him.

We’ll mutiny.

Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!

Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will.

Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.

Peace, ho!

Go fetch fire.

Whither are you going?

Answer every man directly.

That’s as much as to say they are

fools that marry. You’ll bear me a bang for that, I

fear. Proceed directly.

That matter is answered directly.
