


Yea at all points and longs to enter in

Why then the champions are prepared and stay

For nothing but his Majesty's approach

Cousin farewell What presence must not know

From where you do remain let paper show

I brought high Hereford if you call him so

But to the next highway and there I left him

Faith none for me except the northeast wind

Which then blew bitterly against our faces

Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance

Did grace our hollow parting with a tear

Farewell

And for my heart disdaind that my tongue

Should so profane the word that taught me craft

To counterfeit oppression of such grief

That words seemed buried in my sorrow's grave

Marry would the word farewell have lengthened hours

And added years to his short banishment

He should have had a volume of farewells

But since it would not he had none of me

Amen

Yea my lord How brooks your Grace the air

After your late tossing on the breaking seas

He means my lord that we are too remiss

Whilst Bolingbroke through our security

Grows strong and great in substance and in power

Comfort my liege Why looks your Grace so pale

Comfort my liege Remember who you are

Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead

Where is the Duke my father with his power

My father hath a power Inquire of him

And learn to make a body of a limb

My liege one word

No good my lord let's fight with gentle words

Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords

Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke

Princes and noble lords

What answer shall I make to this base man

Shall I so much dishonor my fair stars

On equal terms to give him chastisement

Either I must or have mine honor soiled

With the attainder of his slanderous lips

There is my gage the manual seal of death

That marks thee out for hell I say thou liest

And will maintain what thou hast said is false

In thy heart-blood though being all too base

To stain the temper of my knightly sword

Excepting one I would he were the best

In all this presence that hath moved me so

Thou dar'st not coward live to see that day

Fitzwater thou art damned to hell for this

An if I do not may my hands rot off

And never brandish more revengeful steel

Over the glittering helmet of my foe

Who sets me else By heaven I'll throw at all

I have a thousand spirits in one breast

To answer twenty thousand such as you

Some honest Christian trust me with a gage

That Norfolk lies here do I throw down this

If he may be repealed to try his honor

You holy clergymen is there no plot

To rid the realm of this pernicious blot

Madam I know not nor I greatly care not

God knows I had as lief be none as one

For aught I know my lord they do

If God prevent not I purpose so

My lord 'tis nothing

I do beseech your Grace to pardon me

It is a matter of small consequence

Which for some reasons I would not have seen

I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it

Good mother be content It is no more

Than my poor life must answer

Where is the King

God save your Grace I do beseech your Majesty

To have some conference with your Grace alone

Forever may my knees grow to the earth

My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth

Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak

Then give me leave that I may turn the key

That no man enter till my tale be done

Stay thy revengeful hand Thou hast no cause to fear

Remember as thou read'st thy promise passed

I do repent me Read not my name there

My heart is not confederate with my hand

Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee
