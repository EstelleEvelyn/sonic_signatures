


Though this island seem to be desert

Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible

Yet

It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate

temperance

The air breathes upon us here most sweetly

Tunis was never graced before with such a

paragon to their queen

Widow Dido said you You

make me study of that She was of Carthage not of

Tunis

Carthage

Follow I pray you
