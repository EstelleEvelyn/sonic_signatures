


Captain Fluellen you must come presently to

the mines the Duke of Gloucester would speak

with you

The Duke of Gloucester to whom the order of

the siege is given is altogether directed by an

Irishman a very valiant gentleman i' faith

I think it be

Here he comes and the Scots captain Captain

Jamy with him

How now Captain Macmorris have you quit

the mines Have the pioners given o'er

Gentlemen both you will mistake each other

The town sounds a parley

How now Captain Fluellen Come you from

the bridge

Is the Duke of Exeter safe

What do you call him

I know him not

Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I

remember him now a bawd a cutpurse

Why 'tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and

then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return

into London under the form of a soldier and such

fellows are perfect in the great commanders'

names and they will learn you by rote where

services were doneat such and such a sconce at

such a breach at such a convoy who came off

bravely who was shot who disgraced what terms

the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in

the phrase of war which they trick up with new-tuned

oaths and what a beard of the general's cut

and a horrid suit of the camp will do among

foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to

be thought on But you must learn to know such

slanders of the age or else you may be marvelously

mistook

Captain Fluellen

Why the enemy is loud You hear him all

night

I will speak lower

'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive and

the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha'

done this slaughter Besides they have burned

and carried away all that was in the King's tent

wherefore the King most worthily hath caused

every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat O 'tis a

gallant king

Alexander the Great

I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon

His father was called Philip of Macedon as I

take it

Our king is not like him in that He never

killed any of his friends

Sir John Falstaff

Here comes his Majesty

How now sir You villain

Nay that's right But why wear you your leek

today Saint Davy's day is past

Why here he comes swelling like a

turkey-cock

Enough captain You have astonished him

Go go You are a counterfeit cowardly knave

Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon

an honorable respect and worn as a memorable

trophy of predeceased valor and dare not avouch in

your deeds any of your words I have seen you

gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or

thrice You thought because he could not speak

English in the native garb he could not therefore

handle an English cudgel You find it otherwise and

henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good

English condition Fare you well
