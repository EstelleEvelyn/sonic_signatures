Make us again count o’er ere love be done!

But woe is me! You are so sick of late,

So far from cheer and from your former state,

That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,

Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.

For women fear too much, even as they love,

And women’s fear and love hold quantity,

In neither aught, or in extremity.

Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,

And, as my love is sized, my fear is so:

Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;

Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

O, confound the rest!

Such love must needs be treason in my breast.

In second husband let me be accurst.

None wed the second but who killed the first.

The instances that second marriage move

Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.

A second time I kill my husband dead

When second husband kisses me in bed.

Nor Earth to me give food, nor heaven light,

Sport and repose lock from me day and night,

To desperation turn my trust and hope,

An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope.

Each opposite that blanks the face of joy

Meet what I would have well and it destroy.

Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,

If, once a widow, ever I be wife.

Sleep rock thy brain,

And never come mischance between us twain.
