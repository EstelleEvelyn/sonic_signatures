
Caesar, ’tis his schoolmaster—

An argument that he is plucked, when hither

He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,

Which had superfluous kings for messengers

Not many moons gone by.

Caesar, I shall.

Proculeius,

What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,

And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,

I’ll take her to my guard.

Most noble empress, you have heard of me.

Assuredly you know me.

I understand not, madam.

If it might please you—

Most sovereign creature—

Cleopatra—

Gentle madam, no.

Hear me, good madam.

Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it

As answering to the weight. Would I might never

O’ertake pursued success but I do feel,

By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites

My very heart at root.

I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

Though he be honorable—

Madam, he will. I know ’t.

It is the Emperor, madam.

Where’s the Queen?

Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,

Which my love makes religion to obey,

I tell you this: Caesar through Syria

Intends his journey, and within three days

You with your children will he send before.

Make your best use of this. I have performed

Your pleasure and my promise.

I your servant.

Adieu, good queen. I must attend on Caesar.

How goes it here?

Caesar, thy thoughts

Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming

To see performed the dreaded act which thou

So sought’st to hinder.

O sir, you are too sure an augurer:

That you did fear is done.

Who was last with them?

Here on her breast

There is a vent of blood, and something blown.

The like is on her arm.
