
This is the sergeant

Who like a good and hardy soldier fought

'Gainst my captivityHail brave friend

Say to the King the knowledge of the broil

As thou didst leave it

The worthy Thane of Ross

My liege

They are not yet come back But I have spoke

With one that saw him die who did report

That very frankly he confessed his treasons

Implored your Highness' pardon and set forth

A deep repentance Nothing in his life

Became him like the leaving it He died

As one that had been studied in his death

To throw away the dearest thing he owed

As 'twere a careless trifle

O by whom

Why do we hold our tongues

That most may claim this argument for ours

Nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion

So all

Well contented

What will you do Let's not consort with them

To show an unfelt sorrow is an office

Which the false man does easy I'll to England

This murderous shaft that's shot

Hath not yet lighted and our safest way

Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse

And let us not be dainty of leave-taking

But shift away There's warrant in that theft

Which steals itself when there's no mercy left

Let us seek out some desolate shade and there

Weep our sad bosoms empty

What I believe I'll wail

What know believe and what I can redress

As I shall find the time to friend I will

What you have spoke it may be so perchance

This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues

Was once thought honest You have loved him well

He hath not touched you yet I am young but something

You may deserve of him through me and wisdom

To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb

T' appease an angry god

But Macbeth is

A good and virtuous nature may recoil

In an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon

That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose

Angels are bright still though the brightest fell

Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace

Yet grace must still look so

Perchance even there where I did find my doubts

Why in that rawness left you wife and child

Those precious motives those strong knots of love

Without leave-taking I pray you

Let not my jealousies be your dishonors

But mine own safeties You may be rightly just

Whatever I shall think

Be not offended

I speak not as in absolute fear of you

I think our country sinks beneath the yoke

It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash

Is added to her wounds I think withal

There would be hands uplifted in my right

And here from gracious England have I offer

Of goodly thousands But for all this

When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head

Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country

Shall have more vices than it had before

More suffer and more sundry ways than ever

By him that shall succeed

It is myself I mean in whom I know

All the particulars of vice so grafted

That when they shall be opened black Macbeth

Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state

Esteem him as a lamb being compared

With my confineless harms

I grant him bloody

Luxurious avaricious false deceitful

Sudden malicious smacking of every sin

That has a name But there's no bottom none

In my voluptuousness Your wives your daughters

Your matrons and your maids could not fill up

The cistern of my lust and my desire

All continent impediments would o'erbear

That did oppose my will Better Macbeth

Than such an one to reign

With this there grows

In my most ill-composed affection such

A stanchless avarice that were I king

I should cut off the nobles for their lands

Desire his jewels and this other's house

And my more-having would be as a sauce

To make me hunger more that I should forge

Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal

Destroying them for wealth

But I have none The king-becoming graces

As justice verity temp'rance stableness

Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness

Devotion patience courage fortitude

I have no relish of them but abound

In the division of each several crime

Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should

Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell

Uproar the universal peace confound

All unity on earth

If such a one be fit to govern speak

I am as I have spoken

Macduff this noble passion

Child of integrity hath from my soul

Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts

To thy good truth and honor Devilish Macbeth

By many of these trains hath sought to win me

Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me

From overcredulous haste But God above

Deal between thee and me for even now

I put myself to thy direction and

Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure

The taints and blames I laid upon myself

For strangers to my nature I am yet

Unknown to woman never was forsworn

Scarcely have coveted what was mine own

At no time broke my faith would not betray

The devil to his fellow and delight

No less in truth than life My first false speaking

Was this upon myself What I am truly

Is thine and my poor country's to command

Whither indeed before thy here-approach

Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men

Already at a point was setting forth

Now we'll together and the chance of goodness

Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent

Well more anon

Comes the King forth I pray you

I thank you doctor

'Tis called the evil

A most miraculous work in this good king

Which often since my here-remain in England

I have seen him do How he solicits heaven

Himself best knows but strangely visited people

All swoll'n and ulcerous pitiful to the eye

The mere despair of surgery he cures

Hanging a golden stamp about their necks

Put on with holy prayers and 'tis spoken

To the succeeding royalty he leaves

The healing benediction With this strange virtue

He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy

And sundry blessings hang about his throne

That speak him full of grace

My countryman but yet I know him not

I know him nowGood God betimes remove

The means that makes us strangers

What's the newest grief

Be 't their comfort

We are coming thither Gracious England hath

Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men

An older and a better soldier none

That Christendom gives out

Merciful heaven

What man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows

Give sorrow words The grief that does not speak

Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break

Be comforted

Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge

To cure this deadly grief

Dispute it like a man

Be this the whetstone of your sword Let grief

Convert to anger Blunt not the heart enrage it

This tune goes manly

Come go we to the King Our power is ready

Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth

Is ripe for shaking and the powers above

Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may

The night is long that never finds the day

Cousins I hope the days are near at hand

That chambers will be safe

Let every soldier hew him down a bough

And bear 't before him Thereby shall we shadow

The numbers of our host and make discovery

Err in report of us

'Tis his main hope

For where there is advantage to be given

Both more and less have given him the revolt

And none serve with him but constraind things

Whose hearts are absent too

Now near enough Your leafy screens throw down

And show like those you areYou worthy uncle

Shall with my cousin your right noble son

Lead our first battle Worthy Macduff and we

Shall take upon 's what else remains to do

According to our order

We have met with foes

That strike beside us

I would the friends we miss were safe arrived

Macduff is missing and your noble son

He's worth more sorrow and that I'll spend for him

We shall not spend a large expense of time

Before we reckon with your several loves

And make us even with you My thanes and kinsmen

Henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland

In such an honor named What's more to do

Which would be planted newly with the time

As calling home our exiled friends abroad

That fled the snares of watchful tyranny

Producing forth the cruel ministers

Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen

Who as 'tis thought by self and violent hands

Took off her lifethis and what needful else

That calls upon us by the grace of grace

We will perform in measure time and place

So thanks to all at once and to each one

Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone
