


Good morrow

Sir

Our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea

Shook as the earth did quake

The very principals did seem to rend

And all to topple Pure surprise and fear

Made me to quit the house

But I much marvel that your Lordship having

Rich tire about you should at these early hours

Shake off the golden slumber of repose

'Tis most strange

Nature should be so conversant with pain

Being thereto not compelled

The heavens through you

Increase our wonder and sets up your fame

Forever

Most rare
