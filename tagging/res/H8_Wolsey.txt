


The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor ha

Where's his examination

Is he in person ready

Well we shall then know more and Buckingham

Shall lessen this big look

Please you sir

I know but of a single part in aught

Pertains to th' state and front but in that file

Where others tell steps with me

And for me

I have no further gone in this than by

A single voice and that not passed me but

By learnd approbation of the judges If I am

Traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know

My faculties nor person yet will be

The chronicles of my doing let me say

'Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake

That virtue must go through We must not stint

Our necessary actions in the fear

To cope malicious censurers which ever

As ravenous fishes do a vessel follow

That is new trimmed but benefit no further

Than vainly longing What we oft do best

By sick interpreters once weak ones is

Not ours or not allowed what worst as oft

Hitting a grosser quality is cried up

For our best act If we shall stand still

In fear our motion will be mocked or carped at

We should take root here where we sit

Or sit state-statues only

A word with you

Let there be letters writ to every shire

Of the King's grace and pardon The grievd commons

Hardly conceive of me Let it be noised

That through our intercession this revokement

And pardon comes I shall anon advise you

Further in the proceeding

Stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you

Most like a careful subject have collected

Out of the Duke of Buckingham

Please your Highness note

This dangerous conception in this point

Not friended by his wish to your high person

His will is most malignant and it stretches

Beyond you to your friends

Now madam may his Highness live in freedom

And this man out of prison

You're welcome my fair guests That noble lady

Or gentleman that is not freely merry

Is not my friend This to confirm my welcome

And to you all good health

My Lord Sands

I am beholding to you Cheer your neighbors

Ladies you are not merryGentlemen

Whose fault is this

What's that

What warlike voice

And to what end is thisNay ladies fear not

By all the laws of war you're privileged

Good Lord Chamberlain

Go give 'em welcomeyou can speak the French tongue

And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em

Into our presence where this heaven of beauty

Shall shine at full upon them Some attend him

You have now a broken banquet but we'll mend it

A good digestion to you all and once more

I shower a welcome on you Welcome all

A noble company What are their pleasures

Say Lord Chamberlain

They have done my poor house grace for which I pay 'em

A thousand thanks and pray 'em take their pleasures

My lord

Pray tell 'em thus much from me

There should be one amongst 'em by his person

More worthy this place than myself to whom

If I but knew him with my love and duty

I would surrender it

What say they

Let me see then

By all your good leaves gentlemen  Here I'll make

My royal choice

I am glad

Your Grace is grown so pleasant

Sir Thomas Lovell is the banquet ready

I' th' privy chamber

Your Grace

I fear with dancing is a little heated

There's fresher air my lord

In the next chamber

Sir you cannot

I would your Grace would give us but an hour

Of private conference

Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom

Above all princes in committing freely

Your scruple to the voice of Christendom

Who can be angry now What envy reach you

The Spaniard tied by blood and favor to her

Must now confess if they have any goodness

The trial just and noble all the clerks

I mean the learnd ones in Christian kingdoms

Have their free voices Rome the nurse of judgment

Invited by your noble self hath sent

One general tongue unto us this good man

This just and learnd priest Cardinal Campeius

Whom once more I present unto your Highness

I know your Majesty has always loved her

So dear in heart not to deny her that

A woman of less place might ask by law

Scholars allowed freely to argue for her

Give me your hand Much joy and favor to you

You are the King's now

Yes he was

Yes surely

How Of me

Heav'n's peace be with him

That's Christian care enough For living murmurers

There's places of rebuke He was a fool

For he would needs be virtuous That good fellow

If I command him follows my appointment

I will have none so near else Learn this brother

We live not to be griped by meaner persons

Whilst our commission from Rome is read

Let silence be commanded

Be 't so Proceed

You have here lady

And of your choice these reverend fathers men

Of singular integrity and learning

Yea the elect o' th' land who are assembled

To plead your cause It shall be therefore bootless

That longer you desire the court as well

For your own quiet as to rectify

What is unsettled in the King

Your pleasure madam

Be patient yet

I do profess

You speak not like yourself who ever yet

Have stood to charity and displayed th' effects

Of disposition gentle and of wisdom

O'ertopping woman's power Madam you do me wrong

I have no spleen against you nor injustice

For you or any How far I have proceeded

Or how far further shall is warranted

By a commission from the Consistory

Yea the whole Consistory of Rome You charge me

That I have blown this coal I do deny it

The King is present If it be known to him

That I gainsay my deed how may he wound

And worthily my falsehood yea as much

As you have done my truth If he know

That I am free of your report he knows

I am not of your wrong Therefore in him

It lies to cure me and the cure is to

Remove these thoughts from you the which before

His Highness shall speak in I do beseech

You gracious madam to unthink your speaking

And to say so no more

Most gracious sir

In humblest manner I require your Highness

That it shall please you to declare in hearing

Of all these earsfor where I am robbed and bound

There must I be unloosed although not there

At once and fully satisfiedwhether ever I

Did broach this business to your Highness or

Laid any scruple in your way which might

Induce you to the question on 't or ever

Have to you but with thanks to God for such

A royal lady spake one the least word that might

Be to the prejudice of her present state

Or touch of her good person

Peace to your Highness

May it please you noble madam to withdraw

Into your private chamber we shall give you

The full cause of our coming

Tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina

serenissima

Noble lady

I am sorry my integrity should breed

And service to his Majesty and you

So deep suspicion where all faith was meant

We come not by the way of accusation

To taint that honor every good tongue blesses

Nor to betray you any way to sorrow

You have too much good ladybut to know

How you stand minded in the weighty difference

Between the King and you and to deliver

Like free and honest men our just opinions

And comforts to your cause

Madam you wrong the King's love with these fears

Your hopes and friends are infinite

He tells you rightly

Madam this is a mere distraction

You turn the good we offer into envy

Madam you wander from the good we aim at

Pray hear me

If your Grace

Could but be brought to know our ends are honest

You'd feel more comfort Why should we good lady

Upon what cause wrong you Alas our places

The way of our profession is against it

We are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em

For goodness' sake consider what you do

How you may hurt yourself ay utterly

Grow from the King's acquaintance by this carriage

The hearts of princes kiss obedience

So much they love it But to stubborn spirits

They swell and grow as terrible as storms

I know you have a gentle noble temper

A soul as even as a calm Pray think us

Those we profess peacemakers friends and servants

The packet Cromwell

Gave 't you the King

Looked he o' th' inside of the paper

Is he ready

To come abroad

Leave me awhile

It shall be to the Duchess of Alenon

The French king's sister he shall marry her

Anne Bullen No I'll no Anne Bullens for him

There's more in 't than fair visage Bullen

No we'll no Bullens Speedily I wish

To hear from Rome The Marchioness of Pembroke

The late queen's gentlewoman a knight's daughter

To be her mistress' mistress The Queen's queen

This candle burns not clear 'Tis I must snuff it

Then out it goes What though I know her virtuous

And well-deserving Yet I know her for

A spleeny Lutheran and not wholesome to

Our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of

Our hard-ruled king Again there is sprung up

An heretic an arch-one Cranmer one

Hath crawled into the favor of the King

And is his oracle

Heaven forgive me

Ever God bless your Highness

Sir

For holy offices I have a time a time

To think upon the part of business which

I bear i' th' state and Nature does require

Her times of preservation which perforce

I her frail son amongst my brethren mortal

Must give my tendance to

And ever may your Highness yoke together

As I will lend you cause my doing well

With my well saying

What should this mean

My sovereign I confess your royal graces

Showered on me daily have been more than could

My studied purposes requite which went

Beyond all man's endeavors My endeavors

Have ever come too short of my desires

Yet filed with my abilities Mine own ends

Have been mine so that evermore they pointed

To th' good of your most sacred person and

The profit of the state For your great graces

Heaped upon me poor undeserver I

Can nothing render but allegiant thanks

My prayers to heaven for you my loyalty

Which ever has and ever shall be growing

Till deaththat winterkill it

I do profess

That for your Highness' good I ever labored

More than mine own that am have and will be

Though all the world should crack their duty to you

And throw it from their soul though perils did

Abound as thick as thought could make 'em and

Appear in forms more horridyet my duty

As doth a rock against the chiding flood

Should the approach of this wild river break

And stand unshaken yours

What should this mean

What sudden anger's this How have I reaped it

He parted frowning from me as if ruin

Leaped from his eyes So looks the chafd lion

Upon the daring huntsman that has galled him

Then makes him nothing I must read this paper

I fear the story of his anger  'Tis so

This paper has undone me 'Tis th' accompt

Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together

For mine own endsindeed to gain the popedom

And fee my friends in Rome O negligence

Fit for a fool to fall by What cross devil

Made me put this main secret in the packet

I sent the King Is there no way to cure this

No new device to beat this from his brains

I know 'twill stir him strongly yet I know

A way if it take right in spite of fortune

Will bring me off again What's this To th' Pope

The letter as I live with all the business

I writ to 's Holiness Nay then farewell

I have touched the highest point of all my greatness

And from that full meridian of my glory

I haste now to my setting I shall fall

Like a bright exhalation in the evening

And no man see me more

Stay

Where's your commission lords Words cannot carry

Authority so weighty

Till I find more than will or words to do it

I mean your maliceknow officious lords

I dare and must deny it Now I feel

Of what coarse metal you are molded envy

How eagerly you follow my disgraces

As if it fed you and how sleek and wanton

You appear in everything may bring my ruin

Follow your envious courses men of malice

You have Christian warrant for 'em and no doubt

In time will find their fit rewards That seal

You ask with such a violence the King

Mine and your master with his own hand gave me

Bade me enjoy it with the place and honors

During my life and to confirm his goodness

Tied it by letters patents Now who'll take it

It must be himself then

Proud lord thou liest

Within these forty hours Surrey durst better

Have burnt that tongue than said so

This and all else

This talking lord can lay upon my credit

I answer is most false The Duke by law

Found his deserts How innocent I was

From any private malice in his end

His noble jury and foul cause can witness

If I loved many words lord I should tell you

You have as little honesty as honor

That in the way of loyalty and truth

Toward the King my ever royal master

Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be

And all that love his follies

All goodness

Is poison to thy stomach

How much methinks I could despise this man

But that I am bound in charity against it

So much fairer

And spotless shall mine innocence arise

When the King knows my truth

Speak on sir

I dare your worst objections If I blush

It is to see a nobleman want manners

So farewell to the little good you bear me

Farewell A long farewell to all my greatness

This is the state of man today he puts forth

The tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms

And bears his blushing honors thick upon him

The third day comes a frost a killing frost

And when he thinks good easy man full surely

His greatness is a-ripening nips his root

And then he falls as I do I have ventured

Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders

This many summers in a sea of glory

But far beyond my depth My high-blown pride

At length broke under me and now has left me

Weary and old with service to the mercy

Of a rude stream that must forever hide me

Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate you

I feel my heart new opened O how wretched

Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors

There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to

That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin

More pangs and fears than wars or women have

And when he falls he falls like Lucifer

Never to hope again    Why how now Cromwell

What amazed

At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder

A great man should decline Nay an you weep

I am fall'n indeed

Why well

Never so truly happy my good Cromwell

I know myself now and I feel within me

A peace above all earthly dignities

A still and quiet conscience The King has cured me

I humbly thank his Graceand from these shoulders

These ruined pillars out of pity taken

A load would sink a navy too much honor

O 'tis a burden Cromwell 'tis a burden

Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven

I hope I have I am able now methinks

Out of a fortitude of soul I feel

To endure more miseries and greater far

Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer

What news abroad

God bless him

That's somewhat sudden

But he's a learnd man May he continue

Long in his Highness' favor and do justice

For truth's sake and his conscience that his bones

When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings

May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him

What more

That's news indeed

There was the weight that pulled me down O Cromwell

The King has gone beyond me All my glories

In that one woman I have lost forever

No sun shall ever usher forth mine honors

Or gild again the noble troops that waited

Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell

I am a poor fall'n man unworthy now

To be thy lord and master Seek the King

That sun I pray may never set I have told him

What and how true thou art He will advance thee

Some little memory of me will stir him

I know his noble naturenot to let

Thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell

Neglect him not Make use now and provide

For thine own future safety

Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear

In all my miseries but thou hast forced me

Out of thy honest truth to play the woman

Let's dry our eyes And thus far hear me Cromwell

And when I am forgotten as I shall be

And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention

Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee

Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory

And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor

Found thee a way out of his wrack to rise in

A sure and safe one though thy master missed it

Mark but my fall and that that ruined me

Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition

By that sin fell the angels how can man then

The image of his maker hope to win by it

Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee

Corruption wins not more than honesty

Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace

To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not

Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's

Thy God's and truth's Then if thou fall'st O Cromwell

Thou fall'st a blessd martyr

Serve the King And prithee lead me in

There take an inventory of all I have

To the last penny 'tis the King's My robe

And my integrity to heaven is all

I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell

Had I but served my God with half the zeal

I served my king He would not in mine age

Have left me naked to mine enemies

So I have Farewell

The hopes of court My hopes in heaven do dwell
