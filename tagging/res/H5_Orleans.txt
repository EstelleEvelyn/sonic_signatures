


You have an excellent armor but let my

horse have his due

Will it never be morning

You are as well provided of both as any

prince in the world

He's of the color of the nutmeg

No more cousin

I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's

mistress

Your mistress bears well

The Dauphin longs for morning

By the white hand of my lady he's a gallant

prince

He is simply the most active gentleman of

France

He never did harm that I heard of

I know him to be valiant

What's he

He needs not It is no hidden virtue in him

Ill will never said well

And I will take up that with Give the devil

his due

You are the better at proverbs by how much

A fool's bolt is soon shot

'Tis not the first time you were overshot

What a wretched and peevish fellow is this

King of England to mope with his fat-brained

followers so far out of his knowledge

That they lack for if their heads had any

intellectual armor they could never wear such

heavy headpieces

Foolish curs that run winking into the

mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads

crushed like rotten apples You may as well say

that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the

lip of a lion

Ay but these English are shrewdly out of

beef

It is now two o'clock But let me see by ten

We shall have each a hundred Englishmen

The sun doth gild our armor Up my lords

O brave spirit

Rien puis L'air et feu

 Seigneur Le jour est perdu tout est perdu

Is this the king we sent to for his ransom

We are enough yet living in the field

To smother up the English in our throngs

If any order might be thought upon
