


Your Honor's players hearing your amendment

Are come to play a pleasant comedy

For so your doctors hold it very meet

Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood

And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy

Therefore they thought it good you hear a play

And frame your mind to mirth and merriment

Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
