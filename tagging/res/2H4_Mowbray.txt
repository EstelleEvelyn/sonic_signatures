But gladly would be better satisfied

How in our means we should advance ourselves

To look with forehead bold and big enough

Upon the power and puissance of the King.

Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?

Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground

And dash themselves to pieces.

The just proportion that we gave them out.

Let us sway on and face them in the field.

I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.

Why not to him in part, and to us all

That feel the bruises of the days before

And suffer the condition of these times

To lay a heavy and unequal hand

Upon our honors?

What thing, in honor, had my father lost

That need to be revived and breathed in me?

The King that loved him, as the state stood then,

Was force perforce compelled to banish him,

And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,

Being mounted and both rousèd in their seats,

Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,

Their armèd staves in charge, their beavers down,

Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,

And the loud trumpet blowing them together,

Then, then, when there was nothing could have stayed

My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,

O, when the King did throw his warder down—

His own life hung upon the staff he threw—

Then threw he down himself and all their lives

That by indictment and by dint of sword

Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.

But he hath forced us to compel this offer,

And it proceeds from policy, not love.

Well, by my will, we shall admit no parley.

There is a thing within my bosom tells me

That no conditions of our peace can stand.

Yea, but our valuation shall be such

That every slight and false-derivèd cause,

Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,

Shall to the King taste of this action,

That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,

We shall be winnowed with so rough a wind

That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,

And good from bad find no partition.

Be it so.

Here is returned my Lord of Westmoreland.

Your Grace of York, in God’s name then set forward.

If not, we ready are to try our fortunes

To the last man.

You wish me health in very happy season,

For I am on the sudden something ill.

So much the worse if your own rule be true.

This had been cheerful after victory.

Is this proceeding just and honorable?
