


A crutch a crutch Why call you for a sword

Nurse where's my daughter Call her forth to me

This is the matterNurse give leave awhile

We must talk in secretNurse come back again

I have remembered me thou 's hear our counsel

Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age

She's not fourteen

A fortnight and odd days

Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace

Marry that marry is the very theme

I came to talk ofTell me daughter Juliet

How stands your disposition to be married

Well think of marriage now Younger than you

Here in Verona ladies of esteem

Are made already mothers By my count

I was your mother much upon these years

That you are now a maid Thus then in brief

The valiant Paris seeks you for his love

Verona's summer hath not such a flower

What say you Can you love the gentleman

This night you shall behold him at our feast

Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face

And find delight writ there with beauty's pen

Examine every married lineament

And see how one another lends content

And what obscured in this fair volume lies

Find written in the margent of his eyes

This precious book of love this unbound lover

To beautify him only lacks a cover

The fish lives in the sea and 'tis much pride

For fair without the fair within to hide

That book in many's eyes doth share the glory

That in gold clasps locks in the golden story

So shall you share all that he doth possess

By having him making yourself no less

Speak briefly Can you like of Paris' love

We follow thee Juliet the County stays

Tybalt my cousin O my brother's child

O prince O cousin Husband O the blood is spilled

Of my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true

For blood of ours shed blood of Montague

O cousin cousin

He is a kinsman to the Montague

Affection makes him false he speaks not true

Some twenty of them fought in this black strife

And all those twenty could but kill one life

I beg for justice which thou prince must give

Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live

I will and know her mind early tomorrow

Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness

Ho daughter are you up

Why how now Juliet

Evermore weeping for your cousin's death

What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears

An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live

Therefore have done Some grief shows much of love

But much of grief shows still some want of wit

So shall you feel the loss but not the friend

Which you weep for

Well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death

As that the villain lives which slaughtered him

That same villain Romeo

That is because the traitor murderer lives

We will have vengeance for it fear thou not

Then weep no more I'll send to one in Mantua

Where that same banished runagate doth live

Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram

That he shall soon keep Tybalt company

And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied

Find thou the means and I'll find such a man

But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings girl

Well well thou hast a careful father child

One who to put thee from thy heaviness

Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy

That thou expects not nor I looked not for

Marry my child early next Thursday morn

The gallant young and noble gentleman

The County Paris at Saint Peter's Church

Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride

Here comes your father Tell him so yourself

And see how he will take it at your hands

Ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks

I would the fool were married to her grave

Fie fie what are you mad

You are too hot

Talk not to me for I'll not speak a word

Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee

No not till Thursday There is time enough

We shall be short in our provision

'Tis now near night

What are you busy ho Need you my help

Good night

Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need

Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse

Ay you have been a mouse-hunt in your time

But I will watch you from such watching now

What noise is here

What is the matter

O me O me My child my only life

Revive look up or I will die with thee

Help help Call help

Alack the day she's dead she's dead she's dead

O woeful time

Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day

Most miserable hour that e'er time saw

In lasting labor of his pilgrimage

But one poor one one poor and loving child

But one thing to rejoice and solace in

And cruel death hath catched it from my sight

O the people in the street cry Romeo

Some Juliet and some Paris and all run

With open outcry toward our monument

O me this sight of death is as a bell

That warns my old age to a sepulcher
