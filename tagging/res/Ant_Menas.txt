
Know, worthy Pompey,

That what they do delay they not deny.

We, ignorant of ourselves,

Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers

Deny us for our good; so find we profit

By losing of our prayers.

Caesar and Lepidus

Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.

From Silvius, sir.

I cannot hope

Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.

His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar;

His brother warred upon him, although I think

Not moved by Antony.

Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have

made this treaty.—You and I have known, sir.

We have, sir.

And you by land.

Nor what I have done by water.

And you by land.

All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their

hands are.

No slander. They steal hearts.

For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a

drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his

fortune.

You’ve said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony

here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

Pray you, sir?

Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.

I think the policy of that purpose made more in

the marriage than the love of the parties.

Who would not have his wife so?

And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?

I have a health for you.

Come, let’s away.

Pompey, a word.

Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain,

And hear me speak a word.

If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me,

Rise from thy stool.

I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That’s twice.

But entertain it,

And though thou think me poor, I am the man

Will give thee all the world.

No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.

Thou art, if thou dar’st be, the earthly Jove.

Whate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips

Is thine, if thou wilt ha ’t.

These three world-sharers, these competitors,

Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable,

And when we are put off, fall to their throats.

All there is thine.

For this

I’ll never follow thy palled fortunes more.

Who seeks and will not take when once ’tis offered

Shall never find it more.

Enobarbus, welcome.

Why?

The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,

That it might go on wheels.

Come.

Cup us till the world go round,

Cup us till the world go round.

No, to my cabin. These drums, these trumpets, flutes! What!

Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell

To these great fellows. Sound and be hanged. Sound out!

Hoo! Noble captain, come.
