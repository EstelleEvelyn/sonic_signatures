Doth the news hold of good King Edward’s death?

Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

Woe to that land that’s governed by a child.

Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot,

For then this land was famously enriched

With politic grave counsel; then the King

Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.

Better it were they all came by his father,

Or by his father there were none at all,

For emulation who shall now be nearest

Will touch us all too near if God prevent not.

O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester,

And the Queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud,

And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,

This sickly land might solace as before.

When clouds are seen, wise men put on their cloaks;

When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;

When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?

Untimely storms makes men expect a dearth.

All may be well; but if God sort it so,

’Tis more than we deserve or I expect.

Before the days of change, still is it so.

By a divine instinct, men’s minds mistrust

Ensuing danger, as by proof we see

The water swell before a boist’rous storm.

But leave it all to God. Whither away?

And so was I. I’ll bear you company.
