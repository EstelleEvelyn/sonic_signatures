To the mines? Tell you the Duke it is not so

good to come to the mines, for, look you, the mines

is not according to the disciplines of the war. The

concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th’

athversary, you may discuss unto the Duke, look

you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines.

By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if

there is not better directions.

It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?

By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world. I

will verify as much in his beard. He has no more

directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look

you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.

Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman,

that is certain, and of great expedition and

knowledge in th’ aunchient wars, upon my particular

knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will

maintain his argument as well as any military man

in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars

of the Romans.

Godden to your Worship, good Captain

James.

Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now,

will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations

with you as partly touching or concerning the

disciplines of the war, the Roman wars? In the way

of argument, look you, and friendly communication,

partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the

satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the

direction of the military discipline, that is the point.

Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under

your correction, there is not many of your

nation—

Look you, if you take the matter otherwise

than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I

shall think you do not use me with that affability as,

in discretion, you ought to use me, look you, being

as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of

war and in the derivation of my birth, and in other

particularities.

Captain Macmorris, when there is more

better opportunity to be required, look you, I will

be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of

war, and there is an end.

I assure you there is very excellent services

committed at the bridge.

The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as

Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with

my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and

my living and my uttermost power. He is not, God

be praised and blessed, any hurt in the world, but

keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent

discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at

the pridge; I think in my very conscience he is as

valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no

estimation in the world, but I did see him do as

gallant service.

He is called Aunchient Pistol.

Here is the man.

Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some

love at his hands.

By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune

is painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to

signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is

painted also with a wheel to signify to you, which is

the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant,

and mutability and variation; and her foot, look you,

is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls and rolls

and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most

excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent

moral.

Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand

your meaning.

Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to

rejoice at, for if, look you, he were my brother, I

would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure and

put him to execution, for discipline ought to be

used.

It is well.

Very good.

I’ll assure you he uttered as prave words at

the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day. But it

is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I

warrant you, when time is serve.

I tell you what, Captain Gower. I do perceive

he is not the man that he would gladly make

show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I

will tell him my mind.

Hark you, the King is coming, and I must speak

with him from the pridge.—God pless your

Majesty.

Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of

Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge.

The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant

and most prave passages. Marry, th’ athversary was

have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced

to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the

pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the Duke is a prave

man.

The perdition of th’ athversary hath been

very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I

think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is

like to be executed for robbing a church, one

Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is

all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o’

fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a

coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but

his nose is executed, and his fire’s out.

So. In the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer.

It is the greatest admiration in the universal world

when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and

laws of the wars is not kept. If you would take the

pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the

Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that there is

no tiddle taddle nor pibble babble in Pompey’s

camp. I warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies

of the wars and the cares of it and the forms

of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to

be otherwise.

If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating

coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,

look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating

coxcomb, in your own conscience now?

I pray you and beseech you that you will.

Kill the poys and the luggage! ’Tis expressly

against the law of arms. ’Tis as arrant a piece of

knavery, mark you now, as can be offert, in your

conscience now, is it not?

Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain

Gower. What call you the town’s name where

Alexander the Pig was born?

Why, I pray you, is not “pig” great? The pig,

or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the

magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the

phrase is a little variations.

I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is

porn. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of

the ’orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons

between Macedon and Monmouth, that the

situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in

Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at

Monmouth. It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is

out of my prains what is the name of the other river.

But ’tis all one; ’tis alike as my fingers is to my

fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark

Alexander’s life well, Harry of Monmouth’s life is

come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in

all things. Alexander, God knows and you know, in

his rages and his furies and his wraths and his

cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his

indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in

his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you,

kill his best friend, Cleitus.

It is not well done, mark you now, to take

the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and

finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons

of it. As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in

his ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth,

being in his right wits and his good judgments,

turned away the fat knight with the great-belly

doublet; he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries

and mocks—I have forgot his name.

That is he. I’ll tell you, there is good men

porn at Monmouth.

Your grandfather of famous memory, an ’t

please your Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward

the Plack Prince of Wales, as I have read in the

chronicles, fought a most prave pattle here in

France.

Your Majesty says very true. If your Majesties

is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good

service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing

leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty

know, to this hour is an honorable badge of the

service. And I do believe your Majesty takes no

scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s day.

All the water in Wye cannot wash your

Majesty’s Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell

you that. God pless it and preserve it as long as it

pleases his Grace and his Majesty too.

By Jeshu, I am your Majesty’s countryman,

I care not who know it. I will confess it to all the

’orld. I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty,

praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an

honest man.

He is a craven and a villain else, an ’t

please your Majesty, in my conscience.

Though he be as good a gentleman as the

devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is

necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow

and his oath. If he be perjured, see you now, his

reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as

ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His

earth, in my conscience, la.

Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge

and literatured in the wars.

Your Grace

does me as great honors as can be desired in the

hearts of his subjects. I would fain see the man that

has but two legs that shall find himself aggriefed at

this glove, that is all; but I would fain see it once, an

please God of His grace that I might see.

He is my dear friend, an please you.

I will fetch him.

God’s will and His pleasure,

captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the

King. There is more good toward you peradventure

than is in your knowledge to dream of.

Know the glove? I know the glove is a glove.

’Sblood, an arrant traitor as any ’s in the

universal world, or in France, or in England!

Stand away, Captain Gower. I will give treason

his payment into plows, I warrant you.

That’s a lie in thy throat.—I charge you in

his Majesty’s name, apprehend him. He’s a friend

of the Duke Alençon’s.

My Lord of Warwick, here is, praised be

God for it, a most contagious treason come to

light, look you, as you shall desire in a summer’s

day.

Here is his Majesty.

My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,

look your Grace, has struck the glove which your

Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alençon.

Your Majesty, hear now, saving your Majesty’s

manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly,

lousy knave it is. I hope your Majesty is pear me

testimony and witness and will avouchment that

this is the glove of Alençon that your Majesty is give

me, in your conscience now.

An please your Majesty, let his neck answer

for it, if there is any martial law in the world.

By this day and this light, the fellow has

mettle enough in his belly.—Hold, there is twelvepence

for you, and I pray you to serve God and keep

you out of prawls and prabbles and quarrels and

dissensions, and I warrant you it is the better for

you.

It is with a good will. I can tell you it will

serve you to mend your shoes. Come, wherefore

should you be so pashful? Your shoes is not so

good. ’Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will

change it.

Is it not lawful, an please your Majesty, to

tell how many is killed?

Yes, my conscience, He did us great good.

There is occasions and causes why and

wherefore in all things. I will tell you ass my

friend, Captain Gower. The rascally, scald, beggarly,

lousy, pragging knave Pistol, which you and

yourself and all the world know to be no petter than

a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is come to

me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look

you, and bid me eat my leek. It was in a place where

I could not breed no contention with him, but I will

be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once

again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my

desires.

’Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his

turkey-cocks.—God pless you, Aunchient Pistol,

you scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you.

I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave,

at my desires and my requests and my petitions, to

eat, look you, this leek. Because, look you, you do

not love it, nor your affections and your appetites

and your disgestions does not agree with it, I would

desire you to eat it.

There is one goat for you.

Will you be so good, scald knave,

as eat it?

You say very true, scald knave, when God’s

will is. I will desire you to live in the meantime and

eat your victuals. Come, there is sauce for it.

You called me yesterday “mountain squire,”

but I will make you today a squire of low degree. I

pray you, fall to. If you can mock a leek, you can eat

a leek.

I say I will make him eat some part of my

leek, or I will peat his pate four days.—Bite, I pray

you. It is good for your green wound and your

ploody coxcomb.

Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of

question, too, and ambiguities.

Eat, I pray you. Will you have some more

sauce to your leek? There is not enough leek to

swear by.

Much good do you, scald knave, heartily.

Nay, pray you throw none away. The skin is good for

your broken coxcomb. When you take occásions to

see leeks hereafter, I pray you mock at ’em, that is

all.

Ay, leeks is good. Hold you, there is a groat

to heal your pate.

Yes, verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I

have another leek in my pocket, which you shall

eat.

If I owe you anything, I will pay you in

cudgels. You shall be a woodmonger and buy

nothing of me but cudgels. God be wi’ you and

keep you and heal your pate.
