Have I sought every country far and near,

And, now it is my chance to find thee out,

Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?

Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I’ll die with thee.

Out, out!—My lords, an please you, ’tis not so!

I did beget her, all the parish knows;

Her mother liveth yet, can testify

She was the first fruit of my bach’lorship.

Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!

God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,

And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.

Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.

’Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest

The morn that I was wedded to her mother.—

Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.

Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursèd be the time

Of thy nativity! I would the milk

Thy mother gave thee when thou suck’dst her breast

Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!

Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs afield,

I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!

Dost thou deny thy father, cursèd drab?

O burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.
