


Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquess Dorset

'Tis said my liege in Yorkshire are in arms

But this good comfort bring I to your Highness

The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest

Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat

Unto the shore to ask those on the banks

If they were his assistants yea or no

Who answered him they came from Buckingham

Upon his party He mistrusting them

Hoised sail and made his course again for Brittany
