


Else might the world convince of levity

As well my undertakings as your counsels

But I attest the gods your full consent

Gave wings to my propension and cut off

All fears attending on so dire a project

For what alas can these my single arms

What propugnation is in one man's valor

To stand the push and enmity of those

This quarrel would excite Yet I protest

Were I alone to pass the difficulties

And had as ample power as I have will

Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done

Nor faint in the pursuit

Sir I propose not merely to myself

The pleasures such a beauty brings with it

But I would have the soil of her fair rape

Wiped off in honorable keeping her

What treason were it to the ransacked queen

Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me

Now to deliver her possession up

On terms of base compulsion Can it be

That so degenerate a strain as this

Should once set footing in your generous bosoms

There's not the meanest spirit on our party

Without a heart to dare or sword to draw

When Helen is defended nor none so noble

Whose life were ill bestowed or death unfamed

Where Helen is the subject Then I say

Well may we fight for her whom we know well

The world's large spaces cannot parallel

You have broke it cousin and by my life you

shall make it whole again you shall piece it out

with a piece of your performance

Well said my lord well you say so in fits

What exploit's in hand Where sups he tonight

I'll lay my life with my disposer Cressida

Well I'll make 's excuse

I spy

Ay good now Love love nothing but love

He eats nothing but doves love and that breeds

hot blood and hot blood begets hot thoughts and

hot thoughts beget hot deeds and hot deeds is love

Hector Deiphobus Helenus Antenor and all the

gallantry of Troy I would fain have armed today

but my Nell would not have it so How chance my

brother Troilus went not

To a hair

They're come from the field Let us to Priam's hall

To greet the warriors Sweet Helen I must woo you

To help unarm our Hector His stubborn buckles

With these your white enchanting fingers touched

Shall more obey than to the edge of steel

Or force of Greekish sinews You shall do more

Than all the island kings disarm great Hector

Sweet above thought I love thee

See ho Who is that there

A valiant Greek Aeneas take his hand

Witness the process of your speech wherein

You told how Diomed a whole week by days

Did haunt you in the field

This is the most despiteful gentle greeting

The noblest hateful love that e'er I heard of

What business lord so early

His purpose meets you 'Twas to bring this Greek

To Calchas' house and there to render him

For the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid

Let's have your company or if you please

Haste there before us I constantly believe

Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge

My brother Troilus lodges there tonight

Rouse him and give him note of our approach

With the whole quality whereof I fear

We shall be much unwelcome

There is no help

The bitter disposition of the time

Will have it soOn lord we'll follow you

And tell me noble Diomed faith tell me true

Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship

Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best

Myself or Menelaus

You are too bitter to your countrywoman

Fair Diomed you do as chapmen do

Dispraise the thing that they desire to buy

But we in silence hold this virtue well

We'll not commend that not intend to sell

Here lies our way

It is great morning and the hour prefixed

For her delivery to this valiant Greek

Comes fast upon Good my brother Troilus

Tell you the lady what she is to do

And haste her to the purpose

I know what 'tis to love

And would as I shall pity I could help

Please you walk in my lords

Brother Troilus

Hark Hector's trumpet

'Tis Troilus' fault Come come to field with him

Hector The gods forbid
