


Now daughter Sylvia you are hard beset

Sir Valentine your father is in good health

What say you to a letter from your friends

Of much good news

Know you Don Antonio your countryman

Hath he not a son

You know him well

Beshrew me sir but if he make this good

He is as worthy for an empress' love

As meet to be an emperor's counselor

Well sir this gentleman is come to me

With commendation from great potentates

And here he means to spend his time awhile

I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you

Welcome him then according to his worth

Sylvia I speak to youand you Sir Thurio

For Valentine I need not cite him to it

I will send him hither to you presently

Sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile

We have some secrets to confer about

Now tell me Proteus what's your will with me

Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care

Which to requite command me while I live

This love of theirs myself have often seen

Haply when they have judged me fast asleep

And oftentimes have purposed to forbid

Sir Valentine her company and my court

But fearing lest my jealous aim might err

And so unworthily disgrace the man

A rashness that I ever yet have shunned

I gave him gentle looks thereby to find

That which thyself hast now disclosed to me

And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this

Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested

I nightly lodge her in an upper tower

The key whereof myself have ever kept

And thence she cannot be conveyed away

Upon mine honor he shall never know

That I had any light from thee of this

Sir Valentine whither away so fast

Be they of much import

Nay then no matter Stay with me awhile

I am to break with thee of some affairs

That touch me near wherein thou must be secret

'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought

To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter

No Trust me she is peevish sullen froward

Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty

Neither regarding that she is my child

Nor fearing me as if I were her father

And may I say to thee this pride of hers

Upon advice hath drawn my love from her

And where I thought the remnant of mine age

Should have been cherished by her childlike duty

I now am full resolved to take a wife

And turn her out to who will take her in

Then let her beauty be her wedding dower

For me and my possessions she esteems not

There is a lady in Verona here

Whom I affect but she is nice and coy

And nought esteems my agd eloquence

Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor

For long agone I have forgot to court

Besides the fashion of the time is changed

How and which way I may bestow myself

To be regarded in her sun-bright eye

But she did scorn a present that I sent her

But she I mean is promised by her friends

Unto a youthful gentleman of worth

And kept severely from resort of men

That no man hath access by day to her

Ay but the doors be locked and keys kept safe

That no man hath recourse to her by night

Her chamber is aloft far from the ground

And built so shelving that one cannot climb it

Without apparent hazard of his life

Now as thou art a gentleman of blood

Advise me where I may have such a ladder

This very night for love is like a child

That longs for everything that he can come by

But hark thee I will go to her alone

How shall I best convey the ladder thither

A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn

Then let me see thy cloak

I'll get me one of such another length

How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak

I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me

What letter is this same What's here To Sylvia

And here an engine fit for my proceeding

I'll be so bold to break the seal for once

My thoughts do harbor with my Sylvia nightly

And slaves they are to me that send them flying

O could their master come and go as lightly

Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying

My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them

While I their king that thither them importune

Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them

Because myself do want my servants' fortune

I curse myself for they are sent by me

That they should harbor where their lord should be

What's here

Sylvia this night I will enfranchise thee

'Tis so And here's the ladder for the purpose

Why Phatonfor thou art Merops' son

Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car

And with thy daring folly burn the world

Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee

Go base intruder overweening slave

Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates

And think my patience more than thy desert

Is privilege for thy departure hence

Thank me for this more than for all the favors

Which all too much I have bestowed on thee

But if thou linger in my territories

Longer than swiftest expedition

Will give thee time to leave our royal court

By heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love

I ever bore my daughter or thyself

Begone I will not hear thy vain excuse

But as thou lov'st thy life make speed from hence

Sir Thurio fear not but that she will love you

Now Valentine is banished from her sight

This weak impress of love is as a figure

Trenchd in ice which with an hour's heat

Dissolves to water and doth lose his form

A little time will melt her frozen thoughts

And worthless Valentine shall be forgot

How now Sir Proteus Is your countryman

According to our proclamation gone

My daughter takes his going grievously

So I believe but Thurio thinks not so

Proteus the good conceit I hold of thee

For thou hast shown some sign of good desert

Makes me the better to confer with thee

Thou know'st how willingly I would effect

The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter

And also I think thou art not ignorant

How she opposes her against my will

Ay and perversely she persevers so

What might we do to make the girl forget

The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio

Ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate

Then you must undertake to slander him

Where your good word cannot advantage him

Your slander never can endamage him

Therefore the office is indifferent

Being entreated to it by your friend

And Proteus we dare trust you in this kind

Because we know on Valentine's report

You are already Love's firm votary

And cannot soon revolt and change your mind

Upon this warrant shall you have access

Where you with Sylvia may confer at large

For she is lumpish heavy melancholy

And for your friend's sake will be glad of you

Where you may temper her by your persuasion

To hate young Valentine and love my friend

Ay much is the force of heaven-bred poesy

This discipline shows thou hast been in love

About it gentlemen

Even now about it I will pardon you

How now Sir ProteusHow now Thurio

Which of you saw Eglamour of late

Saw you my daughter

Why then she's fled unto that peasant Valentine

And Eglamour is in her company

'Tis true for Friar Lawrence met them both

As he in penance wandered through the forest

Him he knew well and guessed that it was she

But being masked he was not sure of it

Besides she did intend confession

At Patrick's cell this even and there she was not

These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence

Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse

But mount you presently and meet with me

Upon the rising of the mountain foot

That leads toward Mantua whither they are fled

Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me

Sir Valentine

The more degenerate and base art thou

To make such means for her as thou hast done

And leave her on such slight conditions

Now by the honor of my ancestry

I do applaud thy spirit Valentine

And think thee worthy of an empress' love

Know then I here forget all former griefs

Cancel all grudge repeal thee home again

Plead a new state in thy unrivaled merit

To which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine

Thou art a gentleman and well derived

Take thou thy Sylvia for thou hast deserved her

I grant it for thine own whate'er it be

Thou hast prevailed I pardon them and thee

Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts

Come let us go we will include all jars

With triumphs mirth and rare solemnity

I think the boy hath grace in him he blushes

What mean you by that saying
