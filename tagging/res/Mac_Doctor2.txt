


I have two nights watched with you but can

perceive no truth in your report When was it she

last walked

A great perturbation in nature to receive at

once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of

watching In this slumb'ry agitation besides her

walking and other actual performances what at any

time have you heard her say

You may to me and 'tis most meet you

should

How came she by that light

You see her eyes are open

What is it she does now Look how she rubs

her hands

Hark she speaks I will set down what comes

from her to satisfy my remembrance the more

strongly

Do you mark that

Go to go to You have known what you should

not

What a sigh is there The heart is sorely

charged

Well well well

This disease is beyond my practice Yet I have

known those which have walked in their sleep

who have died holily in their beds

Even so

Will she go now to bed

Foul whisp'rings are abroad Unnatural deeds

Do breed unnatural troubles Infected minds

To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets

More needs she the divine than the physician

God God forgive us all Look after her

Remove from her the means of all annoyance

And still keep eyes upon her So good night

My mind she has mated and amazed my sight

I think but dare not speak

Not so sick my lord

As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies

That keep her from her rest

Therein the patient

Must minister to himself

Ay my good lord Your royal preparation

Makes us hear something

Were I from Dunsinane away and clear

Profit again should hardly draw me here
