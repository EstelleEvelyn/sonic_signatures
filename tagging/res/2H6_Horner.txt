nor thought any such matter. God is my witness, I

am falsely accused by the villain.

Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the

words. My accuser is my prentice; and when I did

correct him for his fault the other day, he did vow

upon his knees he would be even with me. I have

good witness of this. Therefore I beseech your

Majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a

villain’s accusation!

And I accept the combat willingly.

Let it come, i’ faith, and I’ll pledge you all.

And a fig for Peter!

Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon

my man’s instigation, to prove him a knave and

myself an honest man; and touching the Duke of

York, I will take my death I never meant him any

ill, nor the King, nor the Queen.—And therefore,

Peter, have at thee with a downright blow!

Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.
