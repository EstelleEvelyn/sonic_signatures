Fare thee well, fare thee well.

Why, Apemantus?

Away, unpeaceable dog, or I’ll spurn thee hence.

He pours it out. Plutus, the god of gold,

Is but his steward. No meed but he repays

Sevenfold above itself. No gift to him

But breeds the giver a return exceeding

All use of quittance.

Long may he live in fortunes. Shall we in?

I’ll keep you company.

Let it flow this way, my good lord.

Joy had the like conception in our eyes

And, at that instant, like a babe sprung up.

Our horses.

So are we all.

With more than common thanks I will receive it.

O, none so welcome.

So infinitely endeared—
