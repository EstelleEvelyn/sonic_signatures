And let young Arthur, Duke of Brittany, in,

Who by the hand of France this day hath made

Much work for tears in many an English mother,

Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground.

Many a widow’s husband groveling lies

Coldly embracing the discolored earth,

And victory with little loss doth play

Upon the dancing banners of the French,

Who are at hand, triumphantly displayed,

To enter conquerors and to proclaim

Arthur of Brittany England’s king and yours.
