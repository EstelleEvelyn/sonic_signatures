
I am fearful Wherefore frowns he thus

'Tis his aspect of terror All's not well

It is my duty

T' attend your Highness' pleasure

I humbly thank your Highness

And am right glad to catch this good occasion

Most throughly to be winnowed where my chaff

And corn shall fly asunder For I know

There's none stands under more calumnious tongues

Than I myself poor man

Most dread liege

The good I stand on is my truth and honesty

If they shall fail I with mine enemies

Will triumph o'er my person which I weigh not

Being of those virtues vacant I fear nothing

What can be said against me

God and your Majesty

Protect mine innocence or I fall into

The trap is laid for me

I hope I am not too late and yet the gentleman

That was sent to me from the Council prayed me

To make great haste All fast What means this Ho

Who waits there    Sure you know me

Why

So

'Tis Butts

The King's physician As he passed along

How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me

Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace For certain

This is of purpose laid by some that hate me

God turn their hearts I never sought their malice

To quench mine honor They would shame to make me

Wait else at door a fellow councillor

'Mong boys grooms and lackeys But their pleasures

Must be fulfilled and I attend with patience

My good lords hitherto in all the progress

Both of my life and office I have labored

And with no little study that my teaching

And the strong course of my authority

Might go one way and safely and the end

Was ever to do well Nor is there living

I speak it with a single heart my lords

A man that more detests more stirs against

Both in his private conscience and his place

Defacers of a public peace than I do

Pray heaven the King may never find a heart

With less allegiance in it Men that make

Envy and crookd malice nourishment

Dare bite the best I do beseech your Lordships

That in this case of justice my accusers

Be what they will may stand forth face to face

And freely urge against me

Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thank you

You are always my good friend If your will pass

I shall both find your Lordship judge and juror

You are so merciful I see your end

'Tis my undoing Love and meekness lord

Become a churchman better than ambition

Win straying souls with modesty again

Cast none away That I shall clear myself

Lay all the weight you can upon my patience

I make as little doubt as you do conscience

In doing daily wrongs I could say more

But reverence to your calling makes me modest

Is there no other way of mercy

But I must needs to th' Tower my lords

For me

Must I go like a traitor thither

Stay good my lords

I have a little yet to say Look there my lords

By virtue of that ring I take my cause

Out of the grips of cruel men and give it

To a most noble judge the King my master

The greatest monarch now alive may glory

In such an honor How may I deserve it

That am a poor and humble subject to you

And let heaven

Witness how dear I hold this confirmation

And to your royal Grace and the good queen

My noble partners and myself thus pray

All comfort joy in this most gracious lady

Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy

May hourly fall upon you

Elizabeth

Amen

Let me speak sir

For heaven now bids me and the words I utter

Let none think flattery for they'll find 'em truth

This royal infantheaven still move about her

Though in her cradle yet now promises

Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings

Which time shall bring to ripeness She shall be

But few now living can behold that goodness

A pattern to all princes living with her

And all that shall succeed Saba was never

More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue

Than this pure soul shall be All princely graces

That mold up such a mighty piece as this is

With all the virtues that attend the good

Shall still be doubled on her Truth shall nurse her

Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her

She shall be loved and feared Her own shall bless her

Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn

And hang their heads with sorrow Good grows with her

In her days every man shall eat in safety

Under his own vine what he plants and sing

The merry songs of peace to all his neighbors

God shall be truly known and those about her

From her shall read the perfect ways of honor

And by those claim their greatness not by blood

Nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when

The bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix

Her ashes new create another heir

As great in admiration as herself

So shall she leave her blessedness to one

When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness

Who from the sacred ashes of her honor

Shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was

And so stand fixed Peace plenty love truth terror

That were the servants to this chosen infant

Shall then be his and like a vine grow to him

Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine

His honor and the greatness of his name

Shall be and make new nations He shall flourish

And like a mountain cedar reach his branches

To all the plains about him Our children's children

Shall see this and bless heaven

She shall be to the happiness of England

An agd princess many days shall see her

And yet no day without a deed to crown it

Would I had known no more But she must die

She must the saints must have her yet a virgin

A most unspotted lily shall she pass

To th' ground and all the world shall mourn her
