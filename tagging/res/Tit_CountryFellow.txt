he hath taken them down again, for the man must

not be hanged till the next week.

Alas, sir, I know not Jubiter; I never

drank with him in all my life.

Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.

From heaven? Alas, sir, I never

came there. God forbid I should be so bold to press

to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with

my pigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter

of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal’s

men.

Nay, truly, sir, I could never say

grace in all my life.

Ay, sir.

I warrant you, sir. Let me alone.

God be with you, sir. I will.

Yea, forsooth, an your Mistresship be

emperial.

’Tis he!—God and Saint Stephen

give you good e’en. I have brought you a letter and

a couple of pigeons here.

How much money must I have?

Hanged! By ’r Lady, then I have

brought up a neck to a fair end.
