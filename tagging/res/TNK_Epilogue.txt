But, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say.

I am cruel fearful! Pray yet, stay a while,

And let me look upon you. No man smile?

Then it goes hard, I see. He that has

Loved a young handsome wench, then, show his face—

’Tis strange if none be here—and, if he will,

Against his conscience let him hiss and kill

Our market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay you.

Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say you?

And yet mistake me not: I am not bold.

We have no such cause. If the tale we have told—

For ’tis no other—any way content you—

For to that honest purpose it was meant you—

We have our end; and you shall have ere long,

I dare say, many a better, to prolong

Your old loves to us. We, and all our might,

Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.
