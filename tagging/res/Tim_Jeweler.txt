If he will touch the estimate But for that

And rich Here is a water look ye

What my lord Dispraise

My lord 'tis rated

As those which sell would give But you well know

Things of like value differing in the owners

Are prizd by their masters Believe 't dear lord

We'll bear with your Lordship

You know me Apemantus
