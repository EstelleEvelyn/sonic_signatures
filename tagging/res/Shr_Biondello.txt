


Where have I been Nay how now where are you

Master has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes

Or you stolen his Or both Pray what's the news

Ay sir Ne'er a whit

The better for him Would I were so too

He that has the two fair daughtersis 't

he you mean

O excellent motion Fellows let's be gone

Master master news And such old

news as you never heard of

Why is it not news to hear of Petruchio's

coming

Why no sir

He is coming

When he stands where I am and sees you there

Why Petruchio is coming in a new hat and

an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned

a pair of boots that have been candle-cases one

buckled another laced an old rusty sword ta'en

out of the town armory with a broken hilt and

chapeless with two broken points his horse

hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no

kindred besides possessed with the glanders and

like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass

infected with the fashions full of windgalls

sped with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure

of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn

with the bots swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten

near-legged before and with a half-checked

bit and a headstall of sheep's leather

which being restrained to keep him from stumbling

hath been often burst and now repaired with

knots one girth six times pieced and a woman's

crupper of velour which hath two letters for her

name fairly set down in studs and here and there

pieced with packthread

Oh sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned

like the horse with a linen stock on one leg

and a kersey boot-hose on the other gartered with

a red and blue list an old hat and the humor of

forty fancies pricked in 't for a feather A monster

a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian

footboy or a gentleman's lackey

Why sir he comes not

Who That Petruchio came

No sir I say his horse comes with him on

his back

Nay by Saint Jamy

I hold you a penny

A horse and a man

Is more than one

And yet not many

O master master I have watched so long

That I am dog-weary but at last I spied

An ancient angel coming down the hill

Will serve the turn

Master a marcantant or a pedant

I know not what but formal in apparel

In gait and countenance surely like a father

As much as an apple doth an

oyster and all one

Tut fear not me

I told him that your father was at Venice

And that you looked for him this day in Padua

I pray the gods she may with all my heart

Cambio

You saw my master wink and laugh upon

you

Faith nothing but 'has left me here behind

to expound the meaning or moral of his signs

and tokens

Then thus Baptista is safe talking with

the deceiving father of a deceitful son

His daughter is to be brought by you to the

supper

The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at

your command at all hours

I cannot tell except they are busied

about a counterfeit assurance Take you assurance

of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum To th'

church take the priest clerk and some sufficient

honest witnesses

If this be not that you look for I have no more to say

But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day

I cannot tarry I knew a wench married in

an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley

to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir And so adieu

sir My master hath appointed me to go to Saint

Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against

you come with your appendix

Softly and swiftly sir for the priest is

ready

Nay faith I'll see the church a' your back

and then come back to my master's as soon as I

can

I have seen them in the church

together God send 'em good shipping But who is

here Mine old master Vincentio Now we are

undone and brought to nothing

I hope I may choose sir

Forgot you No sir I could not forget you

for I never saw you before in all my life

What my old worshipful old master Yes

marry sir See where he looks out of the window

Help help help Here's a madman will

murder me

O we are spoiled and yonder he is Deny

him forswear him or else we are all undone

I go

Sir my mistress sends you word

That she is busy and she cannot come

She says you have some goodly jest in hand

She will not come She bids you come to her
