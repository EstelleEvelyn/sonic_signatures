


But had he died in the business madam how

then

Beseech you give me leave to retire myself

His bloody brow O Jupiter no blood

Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius

I am glad to see your Ladyship

I thank your Ladyship well good madam

A crack madam

No good madam I will not out of doors

Indeed no by your patience I'll not over the

threshold till my lord return from the wars

I will wish her speedy strength and visit her

with my prayers but I cannot go thither

'Tis not to save labor nor that I want love

No good madam pardon me indeed I will

not forth

O good madam there can be none yet

Indeed madam

Give me excuse good madam I will obey you

in everything hereafter

No at a word madam Indeed I must not I

wish you much mirth

Nay 'tis true

Yes certain there's a letter for you I saw 't

O no no no

The gods grant them true

Welcome to Rome renownd Coriolanus

O heavens O heavens

O the gods

You shall stay too I would I had the power

To say so to my husband

What then

He'd make an end of thy posterity

My lord and husband

The sorrow that delivers us thus changed

Makes you think so

Ay and mine

That brought you forth this boy to keep your name

Living to time
