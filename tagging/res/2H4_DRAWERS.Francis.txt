applejohns Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure

an applejohn

Why then cover and set them down and see if

thou canst find out Sneak's noise Mistress Tearsheet

would fain hear some music Dispatch The

room where they supped is too hot They'll come in

straight

I'll see if I can find out Sneak
