


Both which master constable

How if he will not stand

How if they will not

Well sir

If we know him to be a thief shall we not

lay hands on him

Well masters we hear our charge Let us go

sit here upon the church bench till two and then all

to bed

Peace stir not

Some treason masters Yet stand

close

Call up the right Master Constable

We have here recovered the most

dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in

the commonwealth

Marry that he had received a thousand

ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero

wrongfully

This is all
