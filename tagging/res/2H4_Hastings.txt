


Our present musters grow upon the file

To five-and-twenty thousand men of choice

And our supplies live largely in the hope

Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns

With an incensd fire of injuries

With him we may

But by your leave it never yet did hurt

To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope

Grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth

Should be stillborn and that we now possessed

The utmost man of expectation

I think we are a body strong enough

Even as we are to equal with the King

To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph

For his divisions as the times do brawl

Are in three heads one power against the French

And one against Glendower perforce a third

Must take up us So is the unfirm king

In three divided and his coffers sound

With hollow poverty and emptiness

If he should do so

He leaves his back unarmed the French and Welsh

Baying him at the heels Never fear that

The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland

Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth

But who is substituted against the French

I have no certain notice

We are time's subjects and time bids begone

'Tis Gaultree Forest an 't shall please your Grace

We have sent forth already

Now what news

Hath the Prince John a full commission

In very ample virtue of his father

To hear and absolutely to determine

Of what conditions we shall stand upon

Fear you not that If we can make our peace

Upon such large terms and so absolute

As our conditions shall consist upon

Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains

Besides the King hath wasted all his rods

On late offenders that he now doth lack

The very instruments of chastisement

So that his power like to a fangless lion

May offer but not hold

And though we here fall down

We have supplies to second our attempt

If they miscarry theirs shall second them

And so success of mischief shall be born

And heir from heir shall hold his quarrel up

Whiles England shall have generation

Go captain and deliver to the army

This news of peace Let them have pay and part

I know it will well please them Hie thee captain

My lord our army is dispersed already

Like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses

East west north south or like a school broke up

Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place
