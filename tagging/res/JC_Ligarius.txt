I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand

Any exploit worthy the name of honor.

By all the gods that Romans bow before,

I here discard my sickness.  Soul of Rome,

Brave son derived from honorable loins,

Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up

My mortifièd spirit. Now bid me run,

And I will strive with things impossible,

Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do?

But are not some whole that we must make sick?

Set on your foot,

And with a heart new-fired I follow you

To do I know not what; but it sufficeth

That Brutus leads me on.
