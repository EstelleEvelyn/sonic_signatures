


Mi perdonato, gentle master mine.

I am in all affected as yourself,

Glad that you thus continue your resolve

To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.

Only, good master, while we do admire

This virtue and this moral discipline,

Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,

Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks

As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured.

Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,

And practice rhetoric in your common talk;

Music and poesy use to quicken you;

The mathematics and the metaphysics—

Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.

No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en.

In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

Master, some show to welcome us to town.

Husht, master, here’s some good pastime toward;

That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

Well said, master. Mum, and gaze your fill.

I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible

That love should of a sudden take such hold?

Master, it is no time to chide you now.

Affection is not rated from the heart.

If love have touched you, naught remains but so:

Redime te captum quam queas minimo.

Master, you looked so longly on the maid,

Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all.

Saw you no more? Marked you not how her sister

Began to scold and raise up such a storm

That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

Nay, then ’tis time to stir him from his trance.—

I pray, awake, sir! If you love the maid,

Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:

Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd

That till the father rid his hands of her,

Master, your love must live a maid at home,

And therefore has he closely mewed her up,

Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.

Ay, marry, am I, sir—and now ’tis plotted!

Master, for my hand,

Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

You will be schoolmaster

And undertake the teaching of the maid:

That’s your device.

Not possible. For who shall bear your part

And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son,

Keep house, and ply his book, welcome his friends,

Visit his countrymen and banquet them?

So had you need.

In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,

And I am tied to be obedient

(For so your father charged me at our parting:

“Be serviceable to my son,” quoth he,

Although I think ’twas in another sense),

I am content to be Lucentio,

Because so well I love Lucentio.

So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,

That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.

But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise

You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.

When I am alone, why then I am Tranio;

But in all places else, your master Lucentio.

Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,

Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way

To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

Even he, Biondello.

Perhaps him and her, sir. What have you to do?

I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let’s away.

An if I be, sir, is it any offense?

Why sir, I pray, are not the streets as free

For me, as for you?

For what reason, I beseech you?

Softly, my masters. If you be gentlemen,

Do me this right: hear me with patience.

Baptista is a noble gentleman

To whom my father is not all unknown,

And were his daughter fairer than she is,

She may more suitors have, and me for one.

Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers.

Then well one more may fair Bianca have.

And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,

Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,

The one as famous for a scolding tongue

As is the other for beauteous modesty.

If it be so, sir, that you are the man

Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest,

And if you break the ice and do this feat,

Achieve the elder, set the younger free

For our access, whose hap shall be to have her

Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,

Please you we may contrive this afternoon

And quaff carouses to our mistress’ health,

And do as adversaries do in law,

Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,

That being a stranger in this city here

Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,

Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.

Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,

In the preferment of the eldest sister.

This liberty is all that I request,

That, upon knowledge of my parentage,

I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo

And free access and favor as the rest.

And toward the education of your daughters

I here bestow a simple instrument

And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.

If you accept them, then their worth is great.

Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.

Is this your speeding? Nay,

then, goodnight our part.

Amen, say we. We will be witnesses.

’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you.

’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

And I am one that love Bianca more

Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.

Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

But youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.

That “only” came well in. Sir, list to me:

I am my father’s heir and only son.

If I may have your daughter to my wife,

I’ll leave her houses three or four as good,

Within rich Pisa walls, as any one

Old Signior Gremio has in Padua,

Besides two thousand ducats by the year

Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.—

What, have I pinched you, Signior Gremio?

Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less

Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses

And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,

And twice as much whate’er thou off’rest next.

Why, then, the maid is mine from all the world,

By your firm promise. Gremio is outvied.

That’s but a cavil. He is old, I young.

A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!—

Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.

’Tis in my head to do my master good.

I see no reason but supposed Lucentio

Must get a father, called “supposed Vincentio”—

And that’s a wonder. Fathers commonly

Do get their children. But in this case of wooing,

A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.

Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,

Whatever fortune stays him from his word.

Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;

Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.

But say, what to thine old news?

’Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion,

Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-appareled.

Not so well appareled as I wish

you were.

And tell us what occasion of import

Hath all so long detained you from your wife

And sent you hither so unlike yourself.

See not your bride in these unreverent robes.

Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.

He hath some meaning in his mad attire.

We will persuade him, be it possible,

To put on better ere he go to church.

But, sir, to love concerneth us to add

Her father’s liking, which to bring to pass,

As I before imparted to your Worship,

I am to get a man (whate’er he be

It skills not much, we’ll fit him to our turn),

And he shall be “Vincentio of Pisa,”

And make assurance here in Padua

Of greater sums than I have promisèd.

So shall you quietly enjoy your hope

And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

That by degrees we mean to look into,

And watch our vantage in this business.

We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio,

The narrow prying father, Minola,

The quaint musician, amorous Litio,

All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.

Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

Curster than she? Why, ’tis impossible.

Why, she’s a devil, a devil, the devil’s dam.

What said the wench when he rose again?

Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

Of all mad matches never was the like.

Shall sweet Bianca practice how to bride it?

Is ’t possible, friend Litio, that mistress Bianca

Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?

I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

O despiteful love, unconstant womankind!

I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!

Signior Hortensio, I have often heard

Of your entire affection to Bianca,

And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,

I will with you, if you be so contented,

Forswear Bianca and her love forever.

And here I take the like unfeignèd oath,

Never to marry with her, though she would entreat.

Fie on her, see how beastly she doth court him!

Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace

As ’longeth to a lover’s blessèd case!

Nay, I have ta’en you napping, gentle love,

And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

Mistress, we have.

I’ faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now

That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.

Ay, and he’ll tame her.

Faith, he is gone unto the taming school.

Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master,

That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long

To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

What is he, Biondello?

If he be credulous, and trust my tale,

I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio

And give assurance to Baptista Minola

As if he were the right Vincentio.

Take in your love, and then let me alone.

And you, sir. You are welcome.

Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

What countryman, I pray?

Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid!

And come to Padua, careless of your life?

’Tis death for anyone in Mantua

To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?

Your ships are stayed at Venice, and the Duke,

For private quarrel ’twixt your duke and him,

Hath published and proclaimed it openly.

’Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,

You might have heard it else proclaimed about.

Well, sir, to do you courtesy,

This will I do, and this I will advise you.

First tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Among them know you one Vincentio?

He is my father, sir, and sooth to say,

In count’nance somewhat doth resemble you.

To save your life in this extremity,

This favor will I do you for his sake

(And think it not the worst of all your fortunes

That you are like to Sir Vincentio):

His name and credit shall you undertake,

And in my house you shall be friendly lodged.

Look that you take upon you as you should.

You understand me, sir. So shall you stay

Till you have done your business in the city.

If this be court’sy, sir, accept of it.

Then go with me, to make the matter good.

This, by the way, I let you understand:

My father is here looked for every day

To pass assurance of a dower in marriage

’Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here.

In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you.

Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

Sir, this is the house. Please it you that I call?

’Tis well. And hold your own in any case

With such austerity as ’longeth to a father.

Fear you not him.—Sirrah Biondello,

Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.

Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio.

But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

Thou ’rt a tall fellow. Hold thee that to drink.

Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.

Signior Baptista, you are happily met.—

Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.

I pray you stand good father to me now.

Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best

We be affied and such assurance ta’en

As shall with either part’s agreement stand?

Then at my lodging, an it like you.

There doth my father lie, and there this night

We’ll pass the business privately and well.

Send for your daughter by your servant here.

My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.

The worst is this: that at so slender warning

You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.—

Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?

Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer.

Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.

Sir, what are you that offer to

beat my servant?

How now, what’s the matter?

Sir, you seem a sober ancient

gentleman by your habit, but your words show you

a madman. Why, sir, what ’cerns it you if I wear

pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able

to maintain it.

Call forth an officer.

Carry this mad knave to the jail.—Father Baptista, I

charge you see that he be forthcoming.

Then thou wert best say that I

am not Lucentio.

O, sir, Lucentio slipped me like his greyhound,

Which runs himself and catches for his master.

’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself.

’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
