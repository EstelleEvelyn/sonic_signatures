


Madam the same Your servant

Noble lady

First mine own service to your Grace the next

The King's request that I would visit you

Who grieves much for your weakness and by me

Sends you his princely commendations

And heartily entreats you take good comfort

Madam in good health

Most willing madam

By heaven I will

Or let me lose the fashion of a man
