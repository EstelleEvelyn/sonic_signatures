


Amen

Thou shalt not steal

I never heard any soldier dislike it

No A dozen times at least

Yes that thou hast whether thou

art tainted or free

To what I pray

To three thousand dolors a year

Who's that I pray thee

Besides you know it draws something

near to the speech we had to such a purpose
