


He has no equal.

Marked you his lip and eyes?

Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods—

The present wars devour him! He is grown

Too proud to be so valiant.

Fame, at the which he aims,

In whom already he’s well graced, cannot

Better be held nor more attained than by

A place below the first; for what miscarries

Shall be the General’s fault, though he perform

To th’ utmost of a man, and giddy censure

Will then cry out of Martius “O, if he

Had borne the business!”

Come.

Half all Cominius’ honors are to Martius,

Though Martius earned them not, and all his faults

To Martius shall be honors, though indeed

In aught he merit not.

Let’s along.

Good or bad?

He’s a lamb indeed, that baas like a bear.

Well, sir.

He’s poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

And topping all others in boasting.

Why, how are we censured?

Well, well, sir, well?

We do it not alone, sir.

What then, sir?

Come, sir, come; we know you well enough.

Come, come. You are well understood to be a

perfecter giber for the table than a necessary

bencher in the Capitol.

All tongues speak of him, and the blearèd sights

Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse

Into a rapture lets her baby cry

While she chats him. The kitchen malkin pins

Her richest lockram ’bout her reechy neck,

Clamb’ring the walls to eye him. Stalls, bulks, windows

Are smothered up, leads filled, and ridges horsed

With variable complexions, all agreeing

In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens

Do press among the popular throngs and puff

To win a vulgar station. Our veiled dames

Commit the war of white and damask in

Their nicely-gauded cheeks to th’ wanton spoil

Of Phoebus’ burning kisses. Such a pother,

As if that whatsoever god who leads him

Were slyly crept into his human powers

And gave him graceful posture.

Then our office may,

During his power, go sleep.

In that there’s comfort.

I heard him swear,

Were he to stand for consul, never would he

Appear i’ th’ marketplace nor on him put

The napless vesture of humility,

Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds

To th’ people, beg their stinking breaths.

It was his word. O, he would miss it rather

Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him

And the desire of the nobles.

’Tis most like he will.

So it must fall out

To him, or our authority’s for an end.

We must suggest the people in what hatred

He still hath held them; that to ’s power he would

Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders, and

Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them

In human action and capacity

Of no more soul nor fitness for the world

Than camels in their war, who have their provand

Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows

For sinking under them.

What’s the matter?

Let’s to the Capitol,

And carry with us ears and eyes for th’ time,

But hearts for the event.

Which the rather

We shall be blest to do if he remember

A kinder value of the people than

He hath hereto prized them at.

Most willingly,

But yet my caution was more pertinent

Than the rebuke you give it.

Sir, I hope

My words disbenched you not?

Mark you that?

You see how he intends to use the people.

Come, we’ll inform them

Of our proceedings here. On th’ marketplace

I know they do attend us.

We stay here for the people.

With a proud heart he wore

His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?

We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Could you not have told him

As you were lessoned? When he had no power,

But was a petty servant to the state,

He was your enemy, ever spake against

Your liberties and the charters that you bear

I’ th’ body of the weal; and, now arriving

A place of potency and sway o’ th’ state,

If he should still malignantly remain

Fast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might

Be curses to yourselves. You should have said

That as his worthy deeds did claim no less

Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature

Would think upon you for your voices, and

Translate his malice towards you into love,

Standing your friendly lord.

Did you perceive

He did solicit you in free contempt

When he did need your loves, and do you think

That his contempt shall not be bruising to you

When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies

No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry

Against the rectorship of judgment?

Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends

They have chose a consul that will from them take

Their liberties, make them of no more voice

Than dogs that are as often beat for barking

As therefor kept to do so.

Lay

A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labored,

No impediment between, but that you must

Cast your election on him.

Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,

How youngly he began to serve his country,

How long continued, and what stock he springs of,

The noble house o’ th’ Martians, from whence came

That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,

Who after great Hostilius here was king,

Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,

That our best water brought by conduits hither;

And Censorinus, that was so surnamed,

And nobly namèd so, twice being censor,

Was his great ancestor.

Say you ne’er had done ’t—

Harp on that still—but by our putting on.

And presently, when you have drawn your number,

Repair to th’ Capitol.

Let them go on.

This mutiny were better put in hazard

Than stay, past doubt, for greater.

If, as his nature is, he fall in rage

With their refusal, both observe and answer

The vantage of his anger.

It will be dangerous to go on. No further.

Cominius, no.

The people are incensed against him.

Call ’t not a plot.

The people cry you mocked them; and, of late,

When corn was given them gratis, you repined,

Scandaled the suppliants for the people, called them

Timepleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

Not to them all.

How? I inform them?

Not unlike, each way, to better yours.

You speak o’ th’ people

As if you were a god to punish, not

A man of their infirmity.

Why shall the people give

One that speaks thus their voice?

Enough, with over-measure.

’Has said enough.

Manifest treason.

The aediles, ho! Let him be apprehended.

Seize him, aediles.

Peace, peace, peace! Stay, hold, peace!

By the consent of all, we were established

The people’s magistrates.

Or let us stand to our authority

Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,

Upon the part o’ th’ people, in whose power

We were elected theirs, Martius is worthy

Of present death.

Aediles, seize him!

Sir, those cold ways,

That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous

Where the disease is violent.—Lay hands upon him,

And bear him to the rock.

Lay hands upon him!

He consul?

Merely awry. When he did love his country,

It honored him.

We’ll hear no more.

Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence,

Lest his infection, being of catching nature,

Spread further.

If it were so—

Go not home.

In this point charge him home, that he affects

Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,

Enforce him with his envy to the people,

And that the spoil got on the Antiates

Was ne’er distributed.    What, will he come?

How accompanied?

And when such time they have begun to cry,

Let them not cease, but with a din confused

Enforce the present execution

Of what we chance to sentence.

Go about it.

Put him to choler straight. He hath been used

Ever to conquer and to have his worth

Of contradiction. Being once chafed, he cannot

Be reined again to temperance; then he speaks

What’s in his heart, and that is there which looks

With us to break his neck.

Well, say.—Peace, ho!

But since he hath

Served well for Rome—

I talk of that that know it.

There’s no more to be said, but he is banished

As enemy to the people and his country.

It shall be so.

Now we have shown our power,

Let us seem humbler after it is done

Than when it was a-doing.

Dismiss them home.

Here comes his mother.

Why?

They have ta’en note of us. Keep on your way.

I would he had.

Pray, let’s go.

Well, well, we’ll leave you.

We stood to ’t in good time.    Is this Menenius?

Good e’en to you all, good e’en to you all.

Farewell, kind neighbors. We wished Coriolanus

Had loved you as we did.

Farewell, farewell.

Caius Martius was

A worthy officer i’ th’ war, but insolent,

O’ercome with pride, ambitious, past all thinking

Self-loving.

The gods have well prevented it, and Rome

Sits safe and still without him.

Go see this rumorer whipped. It cannot be

The Volsces dare break with us.

Not possible.

Raised only that the weaker sort may wish

Good Martius home again.

But is this true, sir?

Say not we brought it.

I do not like this news.

Let’s to the Capitol. Would half my wealth

Would buy this for a lie.

Only make trial what your love can do

For Rome, towards Martius.

You know the very road into his kindness

And cannot lose your way.
