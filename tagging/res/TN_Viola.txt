


What country friends is this

And what should I do in Illyria

My brother he is in Elysium

Perchance he is not drownedWhat think you sailors

O my poor brother And so perchance may he be

For saying so there's gold

Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope

Whereto thy speech serves for authority

The like of him Know'st thou this country

Who governs here

What is his name

Orsino I have heard my father name him

He was a bachelor then

What's she

O that I served that lady

And might not be delivered to the world

Till I had made mine own occasion mellow

What my estate is

There is a fair behavior in thee captain

And though that nature with a beauteous wall

Doth oft close in pollution yet of thee

I will believe thou hast a mind that suits

With this thy fair and outward character

I pritheeand I'll pay thee bounteously

Conceal me what I am and be my aid

For such disguise as haply shall become

The form of my intent I'll serve this duke

Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him

It may be worth thy pains for I can sing

And speak to him in many sorts of music

That will allow me very worth his service

What else may hap to time I will commit

Only shape thou thy silence to my wit

I thank thee Lead me on

You either fear his humor or my negligence that

you call in question the continuance of his love Is

he inconstant sir in his favors

I thank you

Here comes the Count

On your attendance my lord here

Sure my noble lord

If she be so abandoned to her sorrow

As it is spoke she never will admit me

Say I do speak with her my lord what then

I think not so my lord

I'll do my best

To woo your lady Yet a barful strife

Whoe'er I woo myself would be his wife

The honorable lady of the house which is she

Most radiant exquisite and unmatchable

beautyI pray you tell me if this be the lady of the

house for I never saw her I would be loath to cast

away my speech for besides that it is excellently

well penned I have taken great pains to con it Good

beauties let me sustain no scorn I am very comptible

even to the least sinister usage

I can say little more than I have studied and

that question's out of my part Good gentle one

give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the

house that I may proceed in my speech

No my profound heart And yet by the very

fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play Are

you the lady of the house

Most certain if you are she you do usurp

yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to

reserve But this is from my commission I will on

with my speech in your praise and then show you

the heart of my message

Alas I took great pains to study it and 'tis

poetical

No good swabber I am to hull here a little

longerSome mollification for your giant sweet

lady

I am a messenger

It alone concerns your ear I bring no overture

of war no taxation of homage I hold the olive in

my hand My words are as full of peace as matter

The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I

learned from my entertainment What I am and

what I would are as secret as maidenhead to your

ears divinity to any other's profanation

Most sweet lady

In Orsino's bosom

To answer by the method in the first of his heart

Good madam let me see your face

Excellently done if God did all

'Tis beauty truly blent whose red and white

Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on

Lady you are the cruel'st she alive

If you will lead these graces to the grave

And leave the world no copy

I see you what you are You are too proud

But if you were the devil you are fair

My lord and master loves you O such love

Could be but recompensed though you were crowned

The nonpareil of beauty

With adorations fertile tears

With groans that thunder love with sighs of fire

If I did love you in my master's flame

With such a suff'ring such a deadly life

In your denial I would find no sense

I would not understand it

Make me a willow cabin at your gate

And call upon my soul within the house

Write loyal cantons of contemnd love

And sing them loud even in the dead of night

Hallow your name to the reverberate hills

And make the babbling gossip of the air

Cry out Olivia O you should not rest

Between the elements of air and earth

But you should pity me

Above my fortunes yet my state is well

I am a gentleman

I am no fee'd post lady Keep your purse

My master not myself lacks recompense

Love make his heart of flint that you shall love

And let your fervor like my master's be

Placed in contempt Farewell fair cruelty

Even now sir On a moderate pace I have since

arrived but hither

She took the ring of me I'll none of it

I left no ring with her What means this lady

Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her

She made good view of me indeed so much

That methought her eyes had lost her tongue

For she did speak in starts distractedly

She loves me sure The cunning of her passion

Invites me in this churlish messenger

None of my lord's ring Why he sent her none

I am the man If it be so as 'tis

Poor lady she were better love a dream

Disguise I see thou art a wickedness

Wherein the pregnant enemy does much

How easy is it for the proper false

In women's waxen hearts to set their forms

Alas our frailty is the cause not we

For such as we are made of such we be

How will this fadge My master loves her dearly

And I poor monster fond as much on him

And she mistaken seems to dote on me

What will become of this As I am man

My state is desperate for my master's love

As I am woman now alas the day

What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe

O Time thou must untangle this not I

It is too hard a knot for me t' untie

It gives a very echo to the seat

Where love is throned

A little by your favor

Of your complexion

About your years my lord

I think it well my lord

And so they are Alas that they are so

To die even when they to perfection grow

But if she cannot love you sir

Sooth but you must

Say that some lady as perhaps there is

Hath for your love as great a pang of heart

As you have for Olivia You cannot love her

You tell her so Must she not then be answered

Ay but I know

Too well what love women to men may owe

In faith they are as true of heart as we

My father had a daughter loved a man

As it might be perhaps were I a woman

I should your Lordship

A blank my lord She never told her love

But let concealment like a worm i' th' bud

Feed on her damask cheek She pined in thought

And with a green and yellow melancholy

She sat like Patience on a monument

Smiling at grief Was not this love indeed

We men may say more swear more but indeed

Our shows are more than will for still we prove

Much in our vows but little in our love

I am all the daughters of my father's house

And all the brothers tooand yet I know not

Sir shall I to this lady

Save thee friend and thy music Dost thou live

by thy tabor

Art thou a churchman

So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a

beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy

tabor if thy tabor stand by the church

Nay that's certain They that dally nicely with

words may quickly make them wanton

Why man

Thy reason man

I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car'st for

nothing

Art not thou the Lady Olivia's Fool

I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's

Nay an thou pass upon me I'll no more with

thee Hold there's expenses for thee

By my troth I'll tell thee I am almost sick for

one though I would not have it grow on my

chinIs thy lady within

Yes being kept together and put to use

I understand you sir 'Tis well begged

This fellow is wise enough to play the Fool

And to do that well craves a kind of wit

He must observe their mood on whom he jests

The quality of persons and the time

And like the haggard check at every feather

That comes before his eye This is a practice

As full of labor as a wise man's art

For folly that he wisely shows is fit

But wise men folly-fall'n quite taint their wit

And you sir

Et vous aussi Votre serviteur

I am bound to your niece sir I mean she is the

list of my voyage

My legs do better understand me sir than I

understand what you mean by bidding me taste my

legs

I will answer you with gait and entrancebut

we are prevented

Most excellent accomplished lady the heavens rain

odors on you

My matter hath no voice lady but to your own

most pregnant and vouchsafed ear

My duty madam and most humble service

Cesario is your servant's name fair princess

And he is yours and his must needs be yours

Your servant's servant is your servant madam

Madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts

On his behalf

Dear lady

I pity you

No not a grize for 'tis a vulgar proof

That very oft we pity enemies

Then westward ho

Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship

You'll nothing madam to my lord by me

That you do think you are not what you are

Then think you right I am not what I am

Would it be better madam than I am

I wish it might for now I am your fool

By innocence I swear and by my youth

I have one heart one bosom and one truth

And that no woman has nor never none

Shall mistress be of it save I alone

And so adieu good madam Nevermore

Will I my master's tears to you deplore

With the same 'havior that your passion bears

Goes on my master's griefs

Nothing but this your true love for my master

I will acquit you

And you sir

You mistake sir I am sure no man hath any

quarrel to me My remembrance is very free and

clear from any image of offense done to any man

I pray you sir what is he

I will return again into the house and desire

some conduct of the lady I am no fighter I have

heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely

on others to taste their valor Belike this is a

man of that quirk

This is as uncivil as strange I beseech you do

me this courteous office as to know of the knight

what my offense to him is It is something of my

negligence nothing of my purpose

Pray you sir do you know of this matter

I beseech you what manner of man is he

I shall be much bound to you for 't I am one

that had rather go with Sir Priest than Sir Knight I

care not who knows so much of my mettle

Pray God defend me A little thing

would make me tell them how much I lack of a

man

I do assure you 'tis against my will

Pray sir put your sword up if

you please

What money sir

For the fair kindness you have showed me here

And part being prompted by your present trouble

Out of my lean and low ability

I'll lend you something My having is not much

I'll make division of my present with you

Hold there's half my coffer

I know of none

Nor know I you by voice or any feature

I hate ingratitude more in a man

Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness

Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption

Inhabits our frail blood

Methinks his words do from such passion fly

That he believes himself so do not I

Prove true imagination O prove true

That I dear brother be now ta'en for you

He named Sebastian I my brother know

Yet living in my glass Even such and so

In favor was my brother and he went

Still in this fashion color ornament

For him I imitate O if it prove

Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love

Here comes the man sir that did rescue me

He did me kindness sir drew on my side

But in conclusion put strange speech upon me

I know not what 'twas but distraction

How can this be

Madam

My lord would speak my duty hushes me

And I most jocund apt and willingly

To do you rest a thousand deaths would die

After him I love

More than I love these eyes more than my life

More by all mores than e'er I shall love wife

If I do feign you witnesses above

Punish my life for tainting of my love

Who does beguile you Who does do you wrong

No my lord not I

My lord I do protest

Why do you speak to me I never hurt you

You drew your sword upon me without cause

But I bespake you fair and hurt you not

Of Messaline Sebastian was my father

Such a Sebastian was my brother too

So went he suited to his watery tomb

If spirits can assume both form and suit

You come to fright us

My father had a mole upon his brow

And died that day when Viola from her birth

Had numbered thirteen years

If nothing lets to make us happy both

But this my masculine usurped attire

Do not embrace me till each circumstance

Of place time fortune do cohere and jump

That I am Viola which to confirm

I'll bring you to a captain in this town

Where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help

I was preserved to serve this noble count

All the occurrence of my fortune since

Hath been between this lady and this lord

And all those sayings will I overswear

And all those swearings keep as true in soul

As doth that orbd continent the fire

That severs day from night

The Captain that did bring me first on shore

Hath my maid's garments He upon some action

Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit

A gentleman and follower of my lady's
