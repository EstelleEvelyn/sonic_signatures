Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;

And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,

Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;

And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,

Who by his prowess conquerèd all France.

From these our Henry lineally descends.

Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,

Whom thou obeyed’st thirty and six years,

And not bewray thy treason with a blush?

Call him my king, by whose injurious doom

My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,

Was done to death? And more than so, my father,

Even in the downfall of his mellowed years,

When nature brought him to the door of death?

No, Warwick, no. While life upholds this arm,

This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.

I like it well that our fair queen and mistress

Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.

What now remains, my lords, for us to do

But march to London with our soldiers?

Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,

’Tis like that Richmond, with the rest, shall down.

And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.

Oxford, Oxford for Lancaster!

Away, away, to meet the Queen’s great power!

Women and children of so high a courage,

And warriors faint? Why, ’twere perpetual shame!

O, brave young prince, thy famous grandfather

Doth live again in thee. Long mayst thou live

To bear his image and renew his glories!

I thought no less. It is his policy

To haste thus fast to find us unprovided.

Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.

For my part, I’ll not trouble thee with words.
