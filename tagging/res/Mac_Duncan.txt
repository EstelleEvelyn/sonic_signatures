As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt

The newest state.

O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!

Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:

They smack of honor both.—Go, get him surgeons.

Who comes here?

Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?

Great happiness!

No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive

Our bosom interest. Go, pronounce his present death,

And with his former title greet Macbeth.

What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not

Those in commission yet returned?

There’s no art

To find the mind’s construction in the face.

He was a gentleman on whom I built

An absolute trust.    O worthiest cousin,

The sin of my ingratitude even now

Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before

That swiftest wing of recompense is slow

To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,

That the proportion both of thanks and payment

Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,

More is thy due than more than all can pay.

Welcome hither.

I have begun to plant thee and will labor

To make thee full of growing.—Noble Banquo,

That hast no less deserved nor must be known

No less to have done so, let me enfold thee

And hold thee to my heart.

My plenteous joys,

Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves

In drops of sorrow.—Sons, kinsmen, thanes,

And you whose places are the nearest, know

We will establish our estate upon

Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter

The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must

Not unaccompanied invest him only,

But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine

On all deservers.—From hence to Inverness

And bind us further to you.

My worthy Cawdor.

True, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant,

And in his commendations I am fed:

It is a banquet to me.—Let’s after him,

Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.

It is a peerless kinsman.

This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air

Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself

Unto our gentle senses.

See, see our honored hostess!—

The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,

Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you

How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains

And thank us for your trouble.

Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?

We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose

To be his purveyor; but he rides well,

And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath helped him

To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,

We are your guest tonight.

Give me your hand.

Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly

And shall continue our graces towards him.

By your leave, hostess.
