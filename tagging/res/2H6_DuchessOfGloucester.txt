


Why droops my lord like over-ripened corn

Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load

Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows

As frowning at the favors of the world

Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth

Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight

What seest thou there King Henry's diadem

Enchased with all the honors of the world

If so gaze on and grovel on thy face

Until thy head be circled with the same

Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold

What is 't too short I'll lengthen it with mine

And having both together heaved it up

We'll both together lift our heads to heaven

And never more abase our sight so low

As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground

What dreamed my lord Tell me and I'll requite it

With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream

Tut this was nothing but an argument

That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove

Shall lose his head for his presumption

But list to me my Humphrey my sweet duke

Methought I sat in seat of majesty

In the cathedral church of Westminster

And in that chair where kings and queens were crowned

Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneeled to me

And on my head did set the diadem

What what my lord Are you so choleric

With Eleanor for telling but her dream

Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself

And not be checked

Yes my good lord I'll follow presently

Follow I must I cannot go before

While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind

Were I a man a duke and next of blood

I would remove these tedious stumbling blocks

And smooth my way upon their headless necks

And being a woman I will not be slack

To play my part in Fortune's pageant

Where are you there Sir John Nay fear not man

We are alone here's none but thee and I

What sayst thou Majesty I am but Grace

What sayst thou man Hast thou as yet conferred

With Margery Jourdain the cunning witch

With Roger Bolingbroke the conjurer

And will they undertake to do me good

It is enough I'll think upon the questions

When from Saint Albans we do make return

We'll see these things effected to the full

Here Hume take this reward  Make merry man

With thy confederates in this weighty cause

Was 't I Yea I it was proud Frenchwoman

Could I come near your beauty with my nails

I'd set my ten commandments in your face

Against her will good king Look to 't in time

She'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby

Though in this place most master wear no breeches

She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged

Well said my masters and welcome all To

this gear the sooner the better

Not half so bad as thine to England's king

Injurious duke that threatest where's no cause

Welcome is banishment Welcome were my death

Come you my lord to see my open shame

Now thou dost penance too Look how they gaze

See how the giddy multitude do point

And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee

Ah Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks

And in thy closet pent up rue my shame

And ban thine enemies both mine and thine

Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself

For whilst I think I am thy married wife

And thou a prince Protector of this land

Methinks I should not thus be led along

Mailed up in shame with papers on my back

And followed with a rabble that rejoice

To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans

The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet

And when I start the envious people laugh

And bid me be advisd how I tread

Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke

Trowest thou that e'er I'll look upon the world

Or count them happy that enjoys the sun

No dark shall be my light and night my day

To think upon my pomp shall be my hell

Sometimes I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife

And he a prince and ruler of the land

Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was

As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess

Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock

To every idle rascal follower

But be thou mild and blush not at my shame

Nor stir at nothing till the ax of death

Hang over thee as sure it shortly will

For Suffolk he that can do all in all

With her that hateth thee and hates us all

And York and impious Beaufort that false priest

Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings

And fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee

But fear not thou until thy foot be snared

Nor never seek prevention of thy foes

What gone my lord and bid me not farewell

Art thou gone too All comfort go with thee

For none abides with me My joy is death

Death at whose name I oft have been afeard

Because I wished this world's eternity

Stanley I prithee go and take me hence

I care not whither for I beg no favor

Only convey me where thou art commanded

That's bad enough for I am but reproach

And shall I then be used reproachfully

Sheriff farewell and better than I fare

Although thou hast been conduct of my shame

Ay ay farewell Thy office is discharged

Come Stanley shall we go

My shame will not be shifted with my sheet

No it will hang upon my richest robes

And show itself attire me how I can

Go lead the way I long to see my prison
