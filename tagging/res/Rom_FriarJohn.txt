


Holy Franciscan friar brother ho

Going to find a barefoot brother out

One of our order to associate me

Here in this city visiting the sick

And finding him the searchers of the town

Suspecting that we both were in a house

Where the infectious pestilence did reign

Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth

So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed

I could not send ithere it is again

Nor get a messenger to bring it thee

So fearful were they of infection

Brother I'll go and bring it thee
