


Truly I have him but I would not be

the party that should desire you to touch him for

his biting is immortal Those that do die of it do

seldom or never recover

Very many men and women too I

heard of one of them no longer than yesterdaya

very honest woman but something given to lie as a

woman should not do but in the way of honesty

how she died of the biting of it what pain she felt

Truly she makes a very good report o' th' worm

But he that will believe all that they say shall never

be saved by half that they do But this is most

falliable the worm's an odd worm

I wish you all joy of the worm

You must think this look you that the

worm will do his kind

Look you the worm is not to be trusted

but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there

is no goodness in the worm

Very good Give it nothing I pray you

for it is not worth the feeding

You must not think I am so simple but

I know the devil himself will not eat a woman I

know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil

dress her not But truly these same whoreson devils

do the gods great harm in their women for in every

ten that they make the devils mar five

Yes forsooth I wish you joy o' th'

worm
