


Are the knights ready to begin the triumph

Return them we are ready and our daughter here

In honor of whose birth these triumphs are

Sits here like Beauty's child whom Nature gat

For men to see and seeing wonder at

It's fit it should be so for princes are

A model which heaven makes like to itself

As jewels lose their glory if neglected

So princes their renowns if not respected

'Tis now your honor daughter to entertain

The labor of each knight in his device

Who is the first that doth prefer himself

He loves you well that holds his life of you

Who is the second that presents himself

And what's the third

What is the fourth

Which shows that beauty hath his power and will

Which can as well inflame as it can kill

And what's the sixth and last the which the knight himself

With such a graceful courtesy delivered

A pretty moral

From the dejected state wherein he is

He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish

Opinion's but a fool that makes us scan

The outward habit by the inward man

But stay the knights are coming

We will withdraw into the gallery

Knights

To say you're welcome were superfluous

To place upon the volume of your deeds

As in a title page your worth in arms

Were more than you expect or more than 's fit

Since every worth in show commends itself

Prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast

You are princes and my guests

Call it by what you will the day is yours

And here I hope is none that envies it

In framing an artist Art hath thus decreed

To make some good but others to exceed

And you are her labored scholarCome queen o' the feast

For daughter so you are here take your place

Marshal the rest as they deserve their grace

Your presence glads our days Honor we love

For who hates honor hates the gods above

Sit sir sit

By Jove I wonder that is king of thoughts

These cates resist me he not thought upon

He's but a country gentleman

Has done no more than other knights have done

Has broken a staff or so So let it pass

What are you merry knights

Here with a cup that's stored unto the brim

As do you love fill to your mistress' lips

We drink this health to you

Yet pause awhile Yon knight doth sit too melancholy

As if the entertainment in our court

Had not a show might countervail his worth

Note it not you Thaisa

O attend my daughter Princes in this

Should live like gods above who freely give

To everyone that come to honor them

And princes not doing so are like to gnats

Which make a sound but killed are wondered at

Therefore to make his entrance more sweet

Here say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him

How

Do as I bid you or you'll move me else

And furthermore tell him we desire to know of him

Of whence he is his name and parentage

Now by the gods I pity his misfortune

And will awake him from his melancholy

Come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles

And waste the time which looks for other revels

Even in your armors as you are addressed

Will well become a soldiers' dance

I will not have excuse with saying this

Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads

Since they love men in arms as well as beds

So this was well asked 'twas so well performed

Come sir

Here's a lady that wants breathing too

And I have heard you knights of Tyre

Are excellent in making ladies trip

And that their measures are as excellent

O that's as much as you would be denied

Of your fair courtesy Unclasp unclasp

Thanks gentlemen to all all have done well

But you the bestPages and lights to conduct

These knights unto their several lodgingsYours sir

We have given order be next our own

Princes it is too late to talk of love

And that's the mark I know you level at

Therefore each one betake him to his rest

Tomorrow all for speeding do their best

Knights from my daughter this I let you know

That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake

A married life Her reason to herself is only known

Which from her by no means can I get

Faith by no means she hath so strictly tied her

To her chamber that 'tis impossible

One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery

This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed

And on her virgin honor will not break it

So

They are well dispatched Now to my daughter's letter

She tells me here she'll wed the stranger knight

Or never more to view nor day nor light

'Tis well mistress your choice agrees with mine

I like that well Nay how absolute she's in 't

Not minding whether I dislike or no

Well I do commend her choice and will no longer

Have it be delayed Soft here he comes

I must dissemble it

To you as much Sir I am beholding to you

For your sweet music this last night I do

Protest my ears were never better fed

With such delightful pleasing harmony

Sir you are music's master

Let me ask you one thing

What do you think of my daughter sir

And she is fair too is she not

Sir my daughter thinks very well of you

Ay so well that you must be her master

And she will be your scholar Therefore look to it

She thinks not so Peruse this writing else

Thou hast bewitched my daughter and thou art

A villain

Traitor thou liest

Ay traitor

Now by the gods I do applaud his courage

No

Here comes my daughter She can witness it

Yea mistress are you so peremptory

I am glad on 't with all my heart

I'll tame you I'll bring you in subjection

Will you not having my consent

Bestow your love and your affections

Upon a stranger Who for aught I know

May benor can I think the contrary

As great in blood as I myself

Therefore hear you mistress either frame

Your will to mineand you sir hear you

Either be ruled by meor I'll make you

Man and wife

Nay come your hands and lips must seal it too

And being joined I'll thus your hopes destroy

And for further griefGod give you joy

What are you both pleased

What are you both agreed

It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed

And then with what haste you can get you to bed
