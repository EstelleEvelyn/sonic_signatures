


My lord

Yes my lord More jewels yet

There is no crossing him in 's humor

Else I should tell him well i' faith I should

When all's spent he'd be crossed then an he could

'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind

That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind

I beseech your Honor

Vouchsafe me a word It does concern you near

I scarce know how

What will this come to

He commands us to provide and give great gifts

And all out of an empty coffer

Nor will he know his purse or yield me this

To show him what a beggar his heart is

Being of no power to make his wishes good

His promises fly so beyond his state

That what he speaks is all in debt he owes

For ev'ry word He is so kind that he

Now pays interest for 't His land's put to their books

Well would I were gently put out of office

Before I were forced out

Happier is he that has no friend to feed

Than such that do e'en enemies exceed

I bleed inwardly for my lord

No care no stop so senseless of expense

That he will neither know how to maintain it

Nor cease his flow of riot Takes no account

How things go from him nor resumes no care

Of what is to continue Never mind

Was to be so unwise to be so kind

What shall be done He will not hear till feel

I must be round with him now he comes from hunting

Fie fie fie fie

Please you gentlemen

The time is unagreeable to this business

Your importunacy cease till after dinner

That I may make his Lordship understand

Wherefore you are not paid

Pray draw near

Pray you walk near I'll speak with you anon

You would not hear me

At many leisures I proposed

O my good lord

At many times I brought in my accounts

Laid them before you You would throw them off

And say you found them in mine honesty

When for some trifling present you have bid me

Return so much I have shook my head and wept

Yea 'gainst th' authority of manners prayed you

To hold your hand more close I did endure

Not seldom nor no slight checks when I have

Prompted you in the ebb of your estate

And your great flow of debts My lovd lord

Though you hear now too late yet now's a time

The greatest of your having lacks a half

To pay your present debts

'Tis all engaged some forfeited and gone

And what remains will hardly stop the mouth

Of present dues The future comes apace

What shall defend the interim And at length

How goes our reck'ning

O my good lord the world is but a word

Were it all yours to give it in a breath

How quickly were it gone

If you suspect my husbandry of falsehood

Call me before th' exactest auditors

And set me on the proof So the gods bless me

When all our offices have been oppressed

With riotous feeders when our vaults have wept

With drunken spilth of wine when every room

Hath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsy

I have retired me to a wasteful cock

And set mine eyes at flow

Heavens have I said the bounty of this lord

How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants

This night englutted Who is not Timon's

What heart head sword force means but is Lord Timon's

Great Timon noble worthy royal Timon

Ah when the means are gone that buy this praise

The breath is gone whereof this praise is made

Feast-won fast-lost One cloud of winter showers

These flies are couched

Assurance bless your thoughts

Lord Lucius and Lucullus Humh

I have been bold

For that I knew it the most general way

To them to use your signet and your name

But they do shake their heads and I am here

No richer in return

They answer in a joint and corporate voice

That now they are at fall want treasure cannot

Do what they would are sorry You are honorable

But yet they could have wishedthey know not

Something hath been amissa noble nature

May catch a wrenchwould all were well'tis pity

And so intending other serious matters

After distasteful looks and these hard fractions

With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods

They froze me into silence

I would I could not think it

That thought is bounty's foe

Being free itself it thinks all others so

What do you ask of me my friend

Ay

If money were as certain as your waiting

'Twere sure enough

Why then preferred you not your sums and bills

When your false masters eat of my lord's meat

Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts

And take down th' int'rest into their glutt'nous maws

You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up

Let me pass quietly

Believe 't my lord and I have made an end

I have no more to reckon he to spend

If 'twill not serve 'tis not so base as you

For you serve knaves

My dear lord

My lord

Here my lord

O my lord

You only speak from your distracted soul

There's not so much left to furnish out

A moderate table

Alack my fellows what should I say to you

Let me be recorded by the righteous gods

I am as poor as you

All broken implements of a ruined house

Good fellows all

The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you

Wherever we shall meet for Timon's sake

Let's yet be fellows Let's shake our heads and say

As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes

We have seen better daysLet each take some

Nay put out all your hands Not one word more

Thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor

O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us

Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt

Since riches point to misery and contempt

Who would be so mocked with glory or to live

But in a dream of friendship

To have his pomp and all what state compounds

But only painted like his varnished friends

Poor honest lord brought low by his own heart

Undone by goodness Strange unusual blood

When man's worst sin is he does too much good

Who then dares to be half so kind again

For bounty that makes gods do still mar men

My dearest lord blest to be most accursed

Rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes

Are made thy chief afflictions Alas kind lord

He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat

Of monstrous friends

Nor has he with him to supply his life

Or that which can command it

I'll follow and inquire him out

I'll ever serve his mind with my best will

Whilst I have gold I'll be his steward still

O you gods

Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord

Full of decay and flailing O monument

And wonder of good deeds evilly bestowed

What an alteration of honor has desp'rate want made

What viler thing upon the Earth than friends

Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends

How rarely does it meet with this time's guise

When man was wished to love his enemies

Grant I may ever love and rather woo

Those that would mischief me than those that do

Has caught me in his eye I will present

My honest grief unto him and as my lord

Still serve him with my lifeMy dearest master

Have you forgot me sir

An honest poor servant of yours

The gods are witness

Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief

For his undone lord than mine eyes for you

I beg of you to know me good my lord

T' accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts

To entertain me as your steward still

No my most worthy master in whose breast

Doubt and suspect alas are placed too late

You should have feared false times when you did feast

Suspect still comes where an estate is least

That which I show heaven knows is merely love

Duty and zeal to your unmatchd mind

Care of your food and living And believe it

My most honored lord

For any benefit that points to me

Either in hope or present I'd exchange

For this one wish that you had power and wealth

To requite me by making rich yourself

O let me stay

And comfort you my master

It is vain that you would speak with Timon

For he is set so only to himself

That nothing but himself which looks like man

Is friendly with him

Here is his cave

Peace and content be here Lord Timon Timon

Look out and speak to friends Th' Athenians

By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee

Speak to them noble Timon

Stay not All's in vain

Trouble him no further Thus you still shall find him
