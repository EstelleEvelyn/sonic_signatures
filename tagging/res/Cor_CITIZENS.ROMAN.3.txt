


We have power in ourselves to do it but

it is a power that we have no power to do for if

he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we

are to put our tongues into those wounds and

speak for them So if he tell us his noble deeds we

must also tell him our noble acceptance of them

Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to

be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude

of the which we being members should

bring ourselves to be monstrous members

We have been called so of many not that

our heads are some brown some black some

abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely

colored and truly I think if all our wits were to

issue out of one skull they would fly east west

north south and their consent of one direct way

should be at once to all the points o' th' compass

Nay your wit will not so soon out as another

man's will 'tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead

But if it were at liberty 'twould sure

southward

To lose itself in a fog where being three

parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth

would return for conscience' sake to help to get

thee a wife

Are you all resolved to give your voices

But that's no matter the greater part carries it I

say if he would incline to the people there was

never a worthier man

Here he comes and in the gown of humility Mark

his behavior We are not to stay all together but to

come by him where he stands by ones by twos

and by threes He's to make his requests by particulars

wherein every one of us has a single honor

in giving him our own voices with our own tongues

Therefore follow me and I'll direct you how you

shall go by him

We do sir Tell us what hath brought you to 't

How not your own desire

You must think if we give you anything

we hope to gain by you

But this is something

odd

Certainly he flouted us downright

No no No man saw 'em

He said he had wounds which he could show in private

And with his hat thus waving it in scorn

I would be consul says he Agd custom

But by your voices will not so permit me

Your voices therefore When we granted that

Here was I thank you for your voices Thank you

Your most sweet voices Now you have left your voices

I have no further with you Was not this mockery

He's not confirmed

We may deny him yet

We will so Almost all

Repent in their election
