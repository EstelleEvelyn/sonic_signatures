The Duke of Norfolk sprightfully and bold

Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet

In God's name and the King's say who thou art

And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms

Against what man thou com'st and what thy quarrel

Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath

As so defend thee heaven and thy valor

What is thy name And wherefore com'st thou hither

Before King Richard in his royal lists

Against whom comest thou And what's thy quarrel

Speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven

On pain of death no person be so bold

Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists

Except the Marshal and such officers

Appointed to direct these fair designs

The appellant in all duty greets your Highness

And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave

Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby

Receive thy lance and God defend the right

Go bear this lance to Thomas Duke of Norfolk

Sound trumpets and set forward combatants

Stay The King hath thrown his warder down

My lord no leave take I for I will ride

As far as land will let me by your side
