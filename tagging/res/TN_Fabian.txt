


Nay I'll come If I lose a scruple of this sport

let me be boiled to death with melancholy

I would exult man You know he brought me

out o' favor with my lady about a bearbaiting here

O peace Contemplation makes a rare

turkeycock of him How he jets under his advanced

plumes

O peace now he's deeply in Look how

imagination blows him

O peace peace

O peace peace peace Now now

Though our silence be drawn from us

with cars yet peace

Nay patience or we break the sinews

of our plot

Now is the woodcock near the gin

This wins him liver and all

A fustian riddle

What dish o' poison has she dressed

him

Sowter will cry upon 't for all this

though it be as rank as a fox

Did not I say he would work it out The

cur is excellent at faults

And O shall end I hope

Ay an you had any eye behind you you

might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes

before you

I will not give my part of this sport for a

pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy

Here comes my noble gull-catcher

You must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew

This was a great argument of love in her toward

you

I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of

judgment and reason

She did show favor to the youth in your sight

only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse

valor to put fire in your heart and brimstone in

your liver You should then have accosted her and

with some excellent jests fire-new from the mint

you should have banged the youth into dumbness

This was looked for at your hand and this was

balked The double gilt of this opportunity you let

time wash off and you are now sailed into the north

of my lady's opinion where you will hang like an

icicle on a Dutchman's beard unless you do redeem

it by some laudable attempt either of valor or

policy

There is no way but this Sir Andrew

This is a dear manikin to you Sir Toby

We shall have a rare letter from him But you'll

not deliver 't

And his opposite the youth bears in his visage

no great presage of cruelty

Here he is here he isHow is 't with you sir

How is 't with you man

Carry his water to th' wisewoman

No way but gentleness gently gently The

fiend is rough and will not be roughly used

If this were played upon a stage now I could

condemn it as an improbable fiction

Why we shall make him mad indeed

More matter for a May morning

Is 't so saucy

Good and valiant

A good note that keeps you from the blow of

the law

Very brief and to exceeding good senseless

Good

Still you keep o' th' windy side of the law

Good

Here he comes with your niece Give them

way till he take leave and presently after him

I know the knight is incensed against you even

to a mortal arbitrament but nothing of the circumstance

more

Nothing of that wonderful promise to read

him by his form as you are like to find him in the

proof of his valor He is indeed sir the most skillful

bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly

have found in any part of Illyria Will you walk

towards him I will make your peace with him if I

can

He is as horribly conceited of

him and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his

heels

Give ground if you see him furious

O good Sir Toby hold Here come the officers

A coward a most devout coward religious

in it

Come let's see the event

Now as thou lov'st me let me see his letter

Anything

This is to give a dog and in recompense desire

my dog again

By the Lord madam you wrong me and

the world shall know it Though you have put me into

darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over

me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your

Ladyship I have your own letter that induced me to

the semblance I put on with the which I doubt not but

to do myself much right or you much shame Think of

me as you please I leave my duty a little unthought of

and speak out of my injury

The madly used Malvolio

Good madam hear me speak

And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come

Taint the condition of this present hour

Which I have wondered at In hope it shall not

Most freely I confess myself and Toby

Set this device against Malvolio here

Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts

We had conceived against him Maria writ

The letter at Sir Toby's great importance

In recompense whereof he hath married her

How with a sportful malice it was followed

May rather pluck on laughter than revenge

If that the injuries be justly weighed

That have on both sides passed
