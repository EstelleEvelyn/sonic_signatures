Tell thou the Earl

That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.

Here comes the Earl.

Noble earl,

I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.

As good as heart can wish.

The King is almost wounded to the death,

And, in the fortune of my lord your son,

Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts

Killed by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John

And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;

And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,

Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,

So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,

Came not till now to dignify the times

Since Caesar’s fortunes.

I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,

A gentleman well bred and of good name,

That freely rendered me these news for true.

My lord, I overrode him on the way,

And he is furnished with no certainties

More than he haply may retail from me.

My lord, I’ll tell you what:

If my young lord your son have not the day,

Upon mine honor, for a silken point

I’ll give my barony. Never talk of it.

Who, he?

He was some hilding fellow that had stol’n

The horse he rode on and, upon my life,

Spoke at a venture.    Look, here comes more news.

I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.

This strainèd passion doth you wrong, my lord.

We all that are engagèd to this loss

Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas

That if we wrought out life, ’twas ten to one;

And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed

Choked the respect of likely peril feared;

And since we are o’erset, venture again.

Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.

The question, then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:

Whether our present five-and-twenty thousand

May hold up head without Northumberland.

Yea, marry, there’s the point.

But if without him we be thought too feeble,

My judgment is we should not step too far

Till we had his assistance by the hand.

For in a theme so bloody-faced as this,

Conjecture, expectation, and surmise

Of aids incertain should not be admitted.

It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,

Eating the air and promise of supply,

Flatt’ring himself in project of a power

Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,

And so, with great imagination

Proper to madmen, led his powers to death

And, winking, leapt into destruction.

Yes, if this present quality of war —

Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot—

Lives so in hope, as in an early spring

We see th’ appearing buds, which to prove fruit

Hope gives not so much warrant as despair

That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,

We first survey the plot, then draw the model,

And when we see the figure of the house,

Then must we rate the cost of the erection,

Which if we find outweighs ability,

What do we then but draw anew the model

In fewer offices, or at least desist

To build at all? Much more in this great work,

Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down

And set another up, should we survey

The plot of situation and the model,

Consent upon a sure foundation,

Question surveyors, know our own estate,

How able such a work to undergo,

To weigh against his opposite. Or else

We fortify in paper and in figures,

Using the names of men instead of men,

Like one that draws the model of an house

Beyond his power to build it, who, half through,

Gives o’er and leaves his part-created cost

A naked subject to the weeping clouds

And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny.

What, is the King but five-and-twenty thousand?

Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
