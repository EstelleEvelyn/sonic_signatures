give over. The trompet sound the retreat. By my

hand I swear, and my father’s soul, the work ish ill

done. It ish give over. I would have blowed up the

town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, ’tish ill

done, ’tish ill done, by my hand, ’tish ill done.

It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save

me. The day is hot, and the weather, and the wars,

and the King, and the dukes. It is no time to

discourse. The town is beseeched. An the trumpet

call us to the breach and we talk and, be Chrish, do

nothing, ’tis shame for us all. So God sa’ me, ’tis

shame to stand still. It is shame, by my hand. And

there is throats to be cut, and works to be done,

and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa’ me, la.

Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a

villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal. What

ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?

I do not know you so good a man as

myself. So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
