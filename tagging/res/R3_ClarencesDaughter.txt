


Why do you weep so oft and beat your breast

And cry O Clarence my unhappy son

And so will I

Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned

Your widow-dolor likewise be unwept

Ah for our father for our dear lord Clarence

What stay had we but Clarence And he's gone

Were never orphans had so dear a loss
