


God make your Majesty joyful as you have been

I do beseech you either not believe

The envious slanders of her false accusers

Or if she be accused on true report

Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds

From wayward sickness and no grounded malice

But now the Duke of Buckingham and I

Are come from visiting his Majesty

A boon my sovereign for my service done

I will not rise unless your Highness hear me

The forfeit sovereign of my servant's life

Who slew today a riotous gentleman

Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk

My lord good morrowGood morrow Catesby

You may jest on but by the Holy Rood

I do not like these several councils I

The lords at Pomfret when they rode from London

Were jocund and supposed their states were sure

And they indeed had no cause to mistrust

But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast

This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt

Pray God I say I prove a needless coward

What shall we toward the Tower The day is spent

They for their truth might better wear their heads

Than some that have accused them wear their hats

But come my lord let's away

It is and wants but nomination

We have not yet set down this day of triumph

Tomorrow in my judgment is too sudden

For I myself am not so well provided

As else I would be were the day prolonged

What of his heart perceive you in his face

By any livelihood he showed today

Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence

And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother

And reverend looker-on of two fair queens

Come madam you must straight to Westminster

There to be crownd Richard's royal queen

Full of wise care is this your counsel madam

Take all the swift advantage of the hours

You shall have letters from me to my son

In your behalf to meet you on the way

Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay

Come madam come I in all haste was sent

Know my loving lord

The Marquess Dorset as I hear is fled

To Richmond in the parts where he abides

None good my liege to please you with the hearing

Nor none so bad but well may be reported

Richmond is on the seas

I know not mighty sovereign but by guess

Stirred up by Dorset Buckingham and Morton

He makes for England here to claim the crown

Unless for that my liege I cannot guess

No my good lord Therefore mistrust me not

No my good lord My friends are in the north

They have not been commanded mighty king

Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave

I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace

Where and what time your Majesty shall please

Most mighty sovereign

You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful

I never was nor never will be false

So deal with him as I prove true to you

Sir Christopher tell Richmond this from me

That in the sty of the most deadly boar

My son George Stanley is franked up in hold

If I revolt off goes young George's head

The fear of that holds off my present aid

So get thee gone Commend me to thy lord

Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented

He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter

But tell me where is princely Richmond now

What men of name resort to him

Well hie thee to thy lord I kiss his hand

My letter will resolve him of my mind

Farewell

Fortune and victory sit on thy helm

I by attorney bless thee from thy mother

Who prays continually for Richmond's good

So much for that The silent hours steal on

And flaky darkness breaks within the east

In brief for so the season bids us be

Prepare thy battle early in the morning

And put thy fortune to the arbitrament

Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war

I as I maythat which I would I cannot

With best advantage will deceive the time

And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms

But on thy side I may not be too forward

Lest being seen thy brother tender George

Be executed in his father's sight

Farewell The leisure and the fearful time

Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love

And ample interchange of sweet discourse

Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon

God give us leisure for these rites of love

Once more adieu Be valiant and speed well

Courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee

Lo here this long-usurpd royalty

From the dead temples of this bloody wretch

Have I plucked off to grace thy brows withal

Wear it enjoy it and make much of it

He is my lord and safe in Leicester town

Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us

John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers

Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon
