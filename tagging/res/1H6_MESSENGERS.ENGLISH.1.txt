


My honorable lords health to you all

Sad tidings bring I to you out of France

Of loss of slaughter and discomfiture

Guyen Champaigne Rheims Roan Orleance

Paris Gisors Poitiers are all quite lost

No treachery but want of men and money

Amongst the soldiers this is mutterd

That here you maintain several factions

And whilst a field should be dispatched and fought

You are disputing of your generals

One would have ling'ring wars with little cost

Another would fly swift but wanteth wings

A third thinks without expense at all

By guileful fair words peace may be obtained

Awake awake English nobility

Let not sloth dim your honors new begot

Cropped are the flower-de-luces in your arms

Of England's coat one half is cut away
