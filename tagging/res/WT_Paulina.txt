


The keeper of the prison call to him

Let him have knowledge who I am  Good lady

No court in Europe is too good for thee

What dost thou then in prison    Now good sir

You know me do you not

Pray you then

Conduct me to the Queen

Here's ado to lock up honesty and honor from

Th' access of gentle visitors Is 't lawful pray you

To see her women Any of them Emilia

I pray now call her

Withdraw yourselves

Well be 't so prithee

Here's such ado to make no stain a stain

As passes coloring    Dear gentlewoman

How fares our gracious lady

A boy

I dare be sworn

These dangerous unsafe lunes i' th' King beshrew them

He must be told on 't and he shall The office

Becomes a woman best I'll take 't upon me

If I prove honey-mouthed let my tongue blister

And never to my red-looked anger be

The trumpet anymore Pray you Emilia

Commend my best obedience to the Queen

If she dares trust me with her little babe

I'll show 't the King and undertake to be

Her advocate to th' loud'st We do not know

How he may soften at the sight o' th' child

The silence often of pure innocence

Persuades when speaking fails

Tell her Emilia

I'll use that tongue I have If wit flow from 't

As boldness from my bosom let 't not be doubted

I shall do good

You need not fear it sir

This child was prisoner to the womb and is

By law and process of great nature thence

Freed and enfranchised not a party to

The anger of the King nor guilty of

If any be the trespass of the Queen

Do not you fear Upon mine honor I

Will stand betwixt you and danger

Nay rather good my lords be second to me

Fear you his tyrannous passion more alas

Than the Queen's life A gracious innocent soul

More free than he is jealous

Not so hot good sir

I come to bring him sleep 'Tis such as you

That creep like shadows by him and do sigh

At each his needless heavings such as you

Nourish the cause of his awaking I

Do come with words as medicinal as true

Honest as either to purge him of that humor

That presses him from sleep

No noise my lord but needful conference

About some gossips for your Highness

From all dishonesty he can In this

Unless he take the course that you have done

Commit me for committing honortrust it

He shall not rule me

Good my liege I come

And I beseech you hear me who professes

Myself your loyal servant your physician

Your most obedient counselor yet that dares

Less appear so in comforting your evils

Than such as most seem yoursI say I come

From your good queen

Good queen my lord good queen I say good queen

And would by combat make her good so were I

A man the worst about you

Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes

First hand me On mine own accord I'll off

But first I'll do my errandThe good queen

For she is good hath brought you forth a daughter

Here 'tiscommends it to your blessing

Not so

I am as ignorant in that as you

In so entitling me and no less honest

Than you are madwhich is enough I'll warrant

As this world goes to pass for honest

Forever

Unvenerable be thy hands if thou

Tak'st up the Princess by that forced baseness

Which he has put upon 't

So I would you did Then 'twere past all doubt

You'd call your children yours

Nor I nor any

But one that's here and that's himself For he

The sacred honor of himself his queen's

His hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander

Whose sting is sharper than the sword's and will not

For as the case now stands it is a curse

He cannot be compelled to 'tonce remove

The root of his opinion which is rotten

As ever oak or stone was sound

It is yours

And might we lay th' old proverb to your charge

So like you 'tis the worseBehold my lords

Although the print be little the whole matter

And copy of the fathereye nose lip

The trick of 's frown his forehead nay the valley

The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles

The very mold and frame of hand nail finger

And thou good goddess Nature which hast made it

So like to him that got it if thou hast

The ordering of the mind too 'mongst all colors

No yellow in 't lest she suspect as he does

Her children not her husband's

A most unworthy and unnatural lord

Can do no more

I care not

It is an heretic that makes the fire

Not she which burns in 't I'll not call you tyrant

But this most cruel usage of your queen

Not able to produce more accusation

Than your own weak-hinged fancy something savors

Of tyranny and will ignoble make you

Yea scandalous to the world

I pray you do not push me I'll be gone

Look to your babe my lord 'tis yours Jove send her

A better guiding spiritWhat needs these hands

You that are thus so tender o'er his follies

Will never do him good not one of you

So so Farewell we are gone

This news is mortal to the Queen Look down

And see what death is doing

Woe the while

O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it

Break too

What studied torments tyrant hast for me

What wheels racks fires What flaying Boiling

In leads or oils What old or newer torture

Must I receive whose every word deserves

To taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny

Together working with thy jealousies

Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle

For girls of nine O think what they have done

And then run mad indeed stark mad for all

Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it

That thou betrayedst Polixenes 'twas nothing

That did but show thee of a fool inconstant

And damnable ingrateful Nor was 't much

Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo's honor

To have him kill a king poor trespasses

More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon

The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter

To be or none or little though a devil

Would have shed water out of fire ere done 't

Nor is 't directly laid to thee the death

Of the young prince whose honorable thoughts

Thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart

That could conceive a gross and foolish sire

Blemished his gracious dam This is not no

Laid to thy answer But the lastO lords

When I have said cry woethe Queen the Queen

The sweet'st dear'st creature's dead and vengeance for 't

Not dropped down yet

I say she's dead I'll swear 't If word nor oath

Prevail not go and see If you can bring

Tincture or luster in her lip her eye

Heat outwardly or breath within I'll serve you

As I would do the godsBut O thou tyrant

Do not repent these things for they are heavier

Than all thy woes can stir Therefore betake thee

To nothing but despair A thousand knees

Ten thousand years together naked fasting

Upon a barren mountain and still winter

In storm perpetual could not move the gods

To look that way thou wert

I am sorry for 't

All faults I make when I shall come to know them

I do repent Alas I have showed too much

The rashness of a woman He is touched

To th' noble heartWhat's gone and what's past help

Should be past grief Do not receive affliction

At my petition I beseech you rather

Let me be punished that have minded you

Of what you should forget Now good my liege

Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman

The love I bore your queenlo fool again

I'll speak of her no more nor of your children

I'll not remember you of my own lord

Who is lost too Take your patience to you

And I'll say nothing

True too true my lord

If one by one you wedded all the world

Or from the all that are took something good

To make a perfect woman she you killed

Would be unparalleled

You are one of those

Would have him wed again

There is none worthy

Respecting her that's gone Besides the gods

Will have fulfilled their secret purposes

For has not the divine Apollo said

Is 't not the tenor of his oracle

That King Leontes shall not have an heir

Till his lost child be found Which that it shall

Is all as monstrous to our human reason

As my Antigonus to break his grave

And come again to mewho on my life

Did perish with the infant 'Tis your counsel

My lord should to the heavens be contrary

Oppose against their wills Care not for issue

The crown will find an heir Great Alexander

Left his to th' worthiest so his successor

Was like to be the best

And left them

More rich for what they yielded

Had she such power

She had just cause

I should so

Were I the ghost that walked I'd bid you mark

Her eye and tell me for what dull part in 't

You chose her Then I'd shriek that even your ears

Should rift to hear me and the words that followed

Should be Remember mine

Will you swear

Never to marry but by my free leave

Then good my lords bear witness to his oath

Unless another

As like Hermione as is her picture

Affront his eye

I have done

Yet if my lord will marryif you will sir

No remedy but you willgive me the office

To choose you a queen She shall not be so young

As was your former but she shall be such

As walked your first queen's ghost it should take joy

To see her in your arms

That

Shall be when your first queen's again in breath

Never till then

O Hermione

As every present time doth boast itself

Above a better gone so must thy grave

Give way to what's seen now Sir you yourself

Have said and writ sobut your writing now

Is colder than that themeshe had not been

Nor was not to be equalled Thus your verse

Flowed with her beauty once 'Tis shrewdly ebbed

To say you have seen a better

How not women

Had our prince

Jewel of children seen this hour he had paired

Well with this lord There was not full a month

Between their births

Sir my liege

Your eye hath too much youth in 't Not a month

'Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes

Than what you look on now

What sovereign sir

I did not well I meant well All my services

You have paid home But that you have vouchsafed

With your crowned brother and these your contracted

Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit

It is a surplus of your grace which never

My life may last to answer

As she lived peerless

So her dead likeness I do well believe

Excels whatever yet you looked upon

Or hand of man hath done Therefore I keep it

Lonely apart But here it is Prepare

To see the life as lively mocked as ever

Still sleep mocked death Behold and say 'tis well

I like your silence It the more shows off

Your wonder But yet speak First you my liege

Comes it not something near

So much the more our carver's excellence

Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her

As she lived now

O patience

The statue is but newly fixed the color's

Not dry

Indeed my lord

If I had thought the sight of my poor image

Would thus have wrought youfor the stone is mine

I'd not have showed it

No longer shall you gaze on 't lest your fancy

May think anon it moves

I'll draw the curtain

My lord's almost so far transported that

He'll think anon it lives

I am sorry sir I have thus far stirred you but

I could afflict you farther

Good my lord forbear

The ruddiness upon her lip is wet

You'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own

With oily painting Shall I draw the curtain

Either forbear

Quit presently the chapel or resolve you

For more amazement If you can behold it

I'll make the statue move indeed descend

And take you by the hand But then you'll think

Which I protest againstI am assisted

By wicked powers

It is required

You do awake your faith Then all stand still

Or those that think it is unlawful business

I am about let them depart

Music awake her Strike

'Tis time Descend Be stone no more Approach

Strike all that look upon with marvel Come

I'll fill your grave up Stir nay come away

Bequeath to death your numbness for from him

Dear life redeems youYou perceive she stirs

Start not Her actions shall be holy as

You hear my spell is lawful Do not shun her

Until you see her die again for then

You kill her double Nay present your hand

When she was young you wooed her now in age

Is she become the suitor

That she is living

Were it but told you should be hooted at

Like an old tale but it appears she lives

Though yet she speak not Mark a little while

Please you to interpose fair madam Kneel

And pray your mother's blessing Turn good lady

Our Perdita is found

There's time enough for that

Lest they desire upon this push to trouble

Your joys with like relation Go together

You precious winners all Your exultation

Partake to everyone I an old turtle

Will wing me to some withered bough and there

My mate that's never to be found again

Lament till I am lost
