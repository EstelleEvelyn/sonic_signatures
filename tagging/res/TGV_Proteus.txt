


Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu.

Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest

Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.

Wish me partaker in thy happiness

When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,

If ever danger do environ thee,

Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,

For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.

Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.

That’s a deep story of a deeper love,

For he was more than over shoes in love.

Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.

What?

So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.

’Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.

Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud

The eating canker dwells, so eating love

Inhabits in the finest wits of all.

And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.

All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.

He after honor hunts, I after love.

He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;

I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.

Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,

Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,

War with good counsel, set the world at nought;

Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.

Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,

An if the shepherd be awhile away.

I do.

A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.

True, and thy master a shepherd.

It shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.

The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the

shepherd for food follows not the sheep. Thou for

wages followest thy master; thy master for wages

follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.

But dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to

Julia?

Here’s too small a pasture for such store of

muttons.

Nay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound

you.

You mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.

But what said she?

Nod—“Ay.” Why, that’s “noddy.”

And that set together is “noddy.”

No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.

Why, sir, how do you bear with me?

Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.

Come, come, open the matter in brief. What

said she?

Well, sir, here is for your

pains. What said she?

Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from

her?

What said she? Nothing?

Go, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack,

Which cannot perish having thee aboard,

Being destined to a drier death on shore.

I must go send some better messenger.

I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,

Receiving them from such a worthless post.

Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life!

Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;

Here is her oath for love, her honor’s pawn.

O, that our fathers would applaud our loves

To seal our happiness with their consents.

O heavenly Julia!

May ’t please your Lordship, ’tis a word or two

Of commendations sent from Valentine,

Delivered by a friend that came from him.

There is no news, my lord, but that he writes

How happily he lives, how well beloved

And daily gracèd by the Emperor,

Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.

As one relying on your Lordship’s will,

And not depending on his friendly wish.

My lord, I cannot be so soon provided.

Please you deliberate a day or two.

Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning

And drenched me in the sea, where I am drowned.

I feared to show my father Julia’s letter

Lest he should take exceptions to my love,

And with the vantage of mine own excuse

Hath he excepted most against my love.

O, how this spring of love resembleth

The uncertain glory of an April day,

Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,

And by and by a cloud takes all away.

Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto.

And yet a thousand times it answers “no.”

Have patience, gentle Julia.

When possibly I can, I will return.

Why, then we’ll make exchange. Here, take you this.

Here is my hand for my true constancy.

And when that hour o’erslips me in the day

Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,

The next ensuing hour some foul mischance

Torment me for my love’s forgetfulness.

My father stays my coming. Answer not.

The tide is now—nay, not thy tide of tears;

That tide will stay me longer than I should.

Julia, farewell. What, gone without a word?

Ay, so true love should do. It cannot speak,

For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

Go. I come, I come.

Alas, this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant

To have a look of such a worthy mistress.

My duty will I boast of, nothing else.

I’ll die on him that says so but yourself.

That you are worthless.

We’ll both attend upon your Ladyship.

Your friends are well and have them much commended.

I left them all in health.

My tales of love were wont to weary you.

I know you joy not in a love discourse.

Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.

Was this the idol that you worship so?

No, but she is an earthly paragon.

I will not flatter her.

When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,

And I must minister the like to you.

Except my mistress.

Have I not reason to prefer mine own?

Why, Valentine, what braggartism is this?

Then let her alone.

But she loves you?

Go on before. I shall inquire you forth.

I must unto the road to disembark

Some necessaries that I needs must use,

And then I’ll presently attend you.

I will.

Even as one heat another heat expels,

Or as one nail by strength drives out another,

So the remembrance of my former love

Is by a newer object quite forgotten.

Is it mine eye, or Valentine’s praise,

Her true perfection, or my false transgression,

That makes me reasonless to reason thus?

She is fair, and so is Julia that I love—

That I did love, for now my love is thawed,

Which like a waxen image ’gainst a fire

Bears no impression of the thing it was.

Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,

And that I love him not as I was wont.

O, but I love his lady too too much,

And that’s the reason I love him so little.

How shall I dote on her with more advice

That thus without advice begin to love her?

’Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,

And that hath dazzled my reason’s light;

But when I look on her perfections,

There is no reason but I shall be blind.

If I can check my erring love, I will;

If not, to compass her I’ll use my skill.

To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn.

To love fair Sylvia, shall I be forsworn.

To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn.

And ev’n that power which gave me first my oath

Provokes me to this threefold perjury.

Love bade me swear, and love bids me forswear.

O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,

Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it.

At first I did adore a twinkling star,

But now I worship a celestial sun;

Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,

And he wants wit that wants resolvèd will

To learn his wit t’ exchange the bad for better.

Fie, fie, unreverend tongue, to call her bad

Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred

With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.

I cannot leave to love, and yet I do.

But there I leave to love where I should love.

Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose;

If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;

If I lose them, thus find I by their loss:

For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Sylvia.

I to myself am dearer than a friend,

For love is still most precious in itself,

And Sylvia—witness heaven that made her fair—

Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.

I will forget that Julia is alive,

Rememb’ring that my love to her is dead;

And Valentine I’ll hold an enemy,

Aiming at Sylvia as a sweeter friend.

I cannot now prove constant to myself

Without some treachery used to Valentine.

This night he meaneth with a corded ladder

To climb celestial Sylvia’s chamber window,

Myself in counsel his competitor.

Now presently I’ll give her father notice

Of their disguising and pretended flight,

Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine,

For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter.

But Valentine being gone, I’ll quickly cross

By some sly trick blunt Thurio’s dull proceeding.

Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,

As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift.

My gracious lord, that which I would discover

The law of friendship bids me to conceal,

But when I call to mind your gracious favors

Done to me, undeserving as I am,

My duty pricks me on to utter that

Which else no worldly good should draw from me.

Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine my friend

This night intends to steal away your daughter;

Myself am one made privy to the plot.

I know you have determined to bestow her

On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,

And should she thus be stol’n away from you,

It would be much vexation to your age.

Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose

To cross my friend in his intended drift

Than, by concealing it, heap on your head

A pack of sorrows which would press you down,

Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.

Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean

How he her chamber-window will ascend

And with a corded ladder fetch her down;

For which the youthful lover now is gone,

And this way comes he with it presently,

Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.

But, good my lord, do it so cunningly

That my discovery be not aimèd at;

For love of you, not hate unto my friend,

Hath made me publisher of this pretense.

Adieu, my lord. Sir Valentine is coming.

Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.

What seest thou?

Valentine?

Who then? His spirit?

What then?

Who wouldst thou strike?

Villain, forbear.

Sirrah, I say forbear.—Friend Valentine, a word.

Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,

For they are harsh, untunable, and bad.

No, Valentine.

No, Valentine.

That thou art banishèd—O, that’s the news—

From hence, from Sylvia, and from me thy friend.

Ay, ay, and she hath offered to the doom—

Which unreversed stands in effectual force—

A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;

Those at her father’s churlish feet she tendered,

With them, upon her knees, her humble self,

Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them

As if but now they waxèd pale for woe.

But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,

Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears

Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;

But Valentine, if he be ta’en, must die.

Besides, her intercession chafed him so,

When she for thy repeal was suppliant,

That to close prison he commanded her

With many bitter threats of biding there.

Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,

And study help for that which thou lament’st.

Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.

Here, if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;

Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.

Hope is a lover’s staff; walk hence with that

And manage it against despairing thoughts.

Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,

Which, being writ to me, shall be delivered

Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.

The time now serves not to expostulate.

Come, I’ll convey thee through the city gate

And, ere I part with thee, confer at large

Of all that may concern thy love affairs.

As thou lov’st Sylvia, though not for thyself,

Regard thy danger, and along with me.

Go, sirrah, find him out.—Come, Valentine.

Gone, my good lord.

A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.

Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace

Let me not live to look upon your Grace.

I do, my lord.

She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.

The best way is to slander Valentine

With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,

Three things that women highly hold in hate.

Ay, if his enemy deliver it.

Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken

By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.

And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do.

’Tis an ill office for a gentleman,

Especially against his very friend.

You have prevailed, my lord. If I can do it

By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,

She shall not long continue love to him.

But say this weed her love from Valentine,

It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.

As much as I can do I will effect.—

But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough.

You must lay lime to tangle her desires

By wailful sonnets, whose composèd rhymes

Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.

Say that upon the altar of her beauty

You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart.

Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears

Moist it again, and frame some feeling line

That may discover such integrity.

For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews,

Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,

Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans

Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.

After your dire-lamenting elegies,

Visit by night your lady’s chamber window

With some sweet consort; to their instruments

Tune a deploring dump; the night’s dead silence

Will well become such sweet complaining grievance.

This, or else nothing, will inherit her.

We’ll wait upon your Grace till after supper

And afterward determine our proceedings.

Already have I been false to Valentine,

And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.

Under the color of commending him,

I have access my own love to prefer.

But Sylvia is too fair, too true, too holy

To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.

When I protest true loyalty to her,

She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;

When to her beauty I commend my vows,

She bids me think how I have been forsworn

In breaking faith with Julia, whom I loved;

And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,

The least whereof would quell a lover’s hope,

Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,

The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

But here comes Thurio. Now must we to her window

And give some evening music to her ear.

Ay, gentle Thurio, for you know that love

Will creep in service where it cannot go.

Sir, but I do, or else I would be hence.

Ay, Sylvia, for your sake.

Who is Sylvia? What is she,

That all our swains commend her?

Holy, fair, and wise is she;

The heaven such grace did lend her

That she might admirèd be.

Is she kind as she is fair?

For beauty lives with kindness.

Love doth to her eyes repair

To help him of his blindness;

And, being helped, inhabits there.

Then to Sylvia let us sing,

That Sylvia is excelling;

She excels each mortal thing

Upon the dull earth dwelling.

To her let us garlands bring.

Sir Thurio, fear not you. I will so plead

That you shall say my cunning drift excels.

At Saint Gregory’s well.

Madam, good even to your Ladyship.

One, lady, if you knew his pure heart’s truth,

You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.

Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.

That I may compass yours.

I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady,

But she is dead.

I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.

Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.

Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,

Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,

The picture that is hanging in your chamber;

To that I’ll speak, to that I’ll sigh and weep,

For since the substance of your perfect self

Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;

And to your shadow will I make true love.

As wretches have o’ernight

That wait for execution in the morn.

Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well

And will employ thee in some service presently.

I hope thou wilt. How now, you whoreson peasant?

Where have you been these two days loitering?

And what says she to my little jewel?

But she received my dog?

What, didst thou offer her this from me?

Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again,

Or ne’er return again into my sight.

Away, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here?

A slave that still an end turns me to shame.

Sebastian, I have entertainèd thee,

Partly that I have need of such a youth

That can with some discretion do my business—

For ’tis no trusting to yond foolish lout—

But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,

Which, if my augury deceive me not,

Witness good bringing-up, fortune, and truth.

Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.

Go presently, and take this ring with thee;

Deliver it to Madam Sylvia.

She loved me well delivered it to me.

Not so; I think she lives.

Why dost thou cry “Alas”?

Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?

Well, give her that ring and therewithal

This letter. That’s her chamber. Tell my lady

I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.

Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,

Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.

O sir, I find her milder than she was,

And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

No, that it is too little.

She says it is a fair one.

But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,

Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes.

Ill, when you talk of war.

O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

That you are well derived.

O, ay, and pities them.

That they are out by lease.

Nor I.

Neither.

And I will follow, more for Sylvia’s love

Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

Madam, this service I have done for you—

Though you respect not aught your servant doth—

To hazard life, and rescue you from him

That would have forced your honor and your love.

Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look;

A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,

And less than this I am sure you cannot give.

Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came,

But by my coming, I have made you happy.

What dangerous action, stood it next to death,

Would I not undergo for one calm look!

O, ’tis the curse in love, and still approved,

When women cannot love where they’re beloved.

In love

Who respects friend?

Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words

Can no way change you to a milder form,

I’ll woo you like a soldier, at arms’ end,

And love you ’gainst the nature of love—force you.

I’ll force thee yield to my desire.

Valentine!

My shame and guilt confounds me.

Forgive me, Valentine. If hearty sorrow

Be a sufficient ransom for offense,

I tender ’t here. I do as truly suffer

As e’er I did commit.

Look to the boy.

Where is that ring, boy?

How, let me see.

Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.

But how cam’st thou by this ring? At my depart

I gave this unto Julia.

How? Julia!

“Than men their minds”? ’Tis true. O heaven, were man

But constant, he were perfect; that one error

Fills him with faults, makes him run through all th’ sins;

Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.

What is in Sylvia’s face but I may spy

More fresh in Julia’s, with a constant eye?

Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish forever.
