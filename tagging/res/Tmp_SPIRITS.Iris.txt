


Ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas

Of wheat rye barley vetches oats and peas

Thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep

And flat meads thatched with stover them to keep

Thy banks with piond and twilld brims

Which spongy April at thy hest betrims

To make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves

Whose shadow the dismissd bachelor loves

Being lass-lorn thy poll-clipped vineyard

And thy sea marge sterile and rocky hard

Where thou thyself dost airthe Queen o' th' sky

Whose wat'ry arch and messenger am I

Bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace

Here on this grass-plot in this very place

To come and sport Her peacocks fly amain

Approach rich Ceres her to entertain

A contract of true love to celebrate

And some donation freely to estate

On the blest lovers

Of her society

Be not afraid I met her deity

Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son

Dove-drawn with her Here thought they to have done

Some wanton charm upon this man and maid

Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid

Till Hymen's torch be lightedbut in vain

Mars's hot minion is returned again

Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows

Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows

And be a boy right out

You nymphs called naiads of the windring brooks

With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks

Leave your crisp channels and on this green land

Answer your summons Juno does command

Come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate

A contract of true love Be not too late

You sunburned sicklemen of August weary

Come hither from the furrow and be merry

Make holiday your rye-straw hats put on

And these fresh nymphs encounter every one

In country footing
