This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,

May be possessèd with some store of crowns,

And I, that haply take them from him now,

May yet ere night yield both my life and them

To some man else, as this dead man doth me.

Who’s this? O God! It is my father’s face,

Whom in this conflict I unwares have killed.

O heavy times, begetting such events!

From London by the King was I pressed forth.

My father, being the Earl of Warwick’s man,

Came on the part of York, pressed by his master.

And I, who at his hands received my life,

Have by my hands of life bereavèd him.

Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did;

And pardon, father, for I knew not thee.

My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks,

And no more words till they have flowed their fill.

How will my mother for a father’s death

Take on with me and ne’er be satisfied!

Was ever son so rued a father’s death?

I’ll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
