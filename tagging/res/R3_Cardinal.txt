Can from his mother win the Duke of York

Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate

To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid

We should infringe the holy privilege

Of blessd sanctuary Not for all this land

Would I be guilty of so deep a sin

My lord you shall o'errule my mind for once

Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me
