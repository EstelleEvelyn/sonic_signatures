Why, man?

Honest good fellow, what’s that? If

it be a day fits you, search out of the calendar, and

nobody look after it!

What a drunken knave was the sea

to cast thee in our way!

Canst thou catch any

fishes, then?

Nay, then, thou wilt starve sure,

for here’s nothing to be got nowadays unless thou

canst fish for ’t.

Hark you, my friend. You said you

could not beg?

But crave? Then I’ll turn craver

too, and so I shall ’scape whipping.

O, not all, my friend, not all; for if

all your beggars were whipped, I would wish no

better office than to be beadle.—But, master, I’ll go

draw up the net.

Help, master, help! Here’s a fish

hangs in the net like a poor man’s right in the law:

’twill hardly come out. Ha! Bots on ’t, ’tis come at

last, and ’tis turned to a rusty armor.

Ay, but hark you, my friend, ’twas

we that made up this garment through the rough

seams of the waters. There are certain condolements,

certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, you’ll

remember from whence you had them.

We’ll sure provide. Thou shalt have

my best gown to make thee a pair; and I’ll bring

thee to the court myself.
