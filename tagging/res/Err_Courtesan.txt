I see sir you have found the goldsmith now

Is that the chain you promised me today

Your man and you are marvelous merry sir

Will you go with me We'll mend our dinner here

Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner

Or for my diamond the chain you promised

And I'll be gone sir and not trouble you

I pray you sir my ring or else the chain

I hope you do not mean to cheat me so

Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad

Else would he never so demean himself

A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats

And for the same he promised me a chain

Both one and other he denies me now

The reason that I gather he is mad

Besides this present instance of his rage

Is a mad tale he told today at dinner

Of his own doors being shut against his entrance

Belike his wife acquainted with his fits

On purpose shut the doors against his way

My way is now to hie home to his house

And tell his wife that being lunatic

He rushed into my house and took perforce

My ring away This course I fittest choose

For forty ducats is too much to lose

How say you now Is not your husband mad

Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy

Whenas your husband all in rage today

Came to my house and took away my ring

The ring I saw upon his finger now

Straight after did I meet him with a chain

He did and from my finger snatched that ring

As sure my liege as I do see your Grace

Sir I must have that diamond from you
