


He is not with himself let us withdraw

No man shed tears for noble Mutius

He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause

My sight is very dull whate'er it bodes

What art thou fallen What subtle hole is this

Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers

Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood

As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers

A very fatal place it seems to me

Speak brother Hast thou hurt thee with the fall

I am surprisd with an uncouth fear

A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints

My heart suspects more than mine eye can see

Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart

Will not permit mine eyes once to behold

The thing whereat it trembles by surmise

O tell me who it is for ne'er till now

Was I a child to fear I know not what

If it be dark how dost thou know 'tis he

Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out

Or wanting strength to do thee so much good

I may be plucked into the swallowing womb

Of this deep pit poor Bassianus' grave

I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink

Thy hand once more I will not loose again

Till thou art here aloft or I below

Thou canst not come to me I come to thee
