'Tis our hope sir

After well-entered soldiers to return

And find your Grace in health

Health at your bidding serve your Majesty

Our hearts receive your warnings

O my sweet lord that you will stay behind us

There's honor in the theft

Farewell captain

We shall noble captain

Holy seems the quarrel

Upon your Grace's part black and fearful

On the opposer

But I am sure the younger of our nation

That surfeit on their ease will day by day

Come here for physic

Nay good my lord put him to 't Let him

have his way

On my life my lord a bubble

Believe it my lord In mine own direct

knowledge without any malice but to speak of

him as my kinsman he's a most notable coward

an infinite and endless liar an hourly promise-breaker

the owner of no one good quality worthy

your Lordship's entertainment

I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly

surprise him Such I will have whom I am sure

he knows not from the enemy We will bind and

hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other

but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversary's

when we bring him to our own tents Be but

your Lordship present at his examination If he do

not for the promise of his life and in the highest

compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and

deliver all the intelligence in his power against

you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul

upon oath never trust my judgment in anything

O for the love of laughter

hinder not the honor of his design Let him

fetch off his drum in any hand

No more than a fish loves water Is not this

a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems

to undertake this business which he knows is not

to be done damns himself to do and dares better

be damned than to do 't

None in the world but return with an

invention and clap upon you two or three probable

lies But we have almost embossed him You shall

see his fall tonight for indeed he is not for your

Lordship's respect

I must go look my twigs He shall be

caught

As 't please your Lordship I'll leave you

He can come no other way but by this hedge

corner When you sally upon him speak what terrible

language you will Though you understand it

not yourselves no matter For we must not seem to

understand him unless some one among us whom

we must produce for an interpreter

Art not acquainted with him Knows he not thy

voice

But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to

us again

He must think us some band of strangers i' th'

adversary's entertainment Now he hath a smack

of all neighboring languages Therefore we must

every one be a man of his own fancy not to know

what we speak one to another So we seem to know

is to know straight our purpose choughs' language

gabble enough and good enough As for

you interpreter you must seem very politic But

couch ho Here he comes to beguile two hours in

a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he

forges

This is the first truth that e'er thine own

tongue was guilty of

Is it possible he should know what he is

and be that he is

We cannot afford you so

'Twould not do

Hardly serve

How deep

Three great oaths would scarce make

that be believed

You shall hear one anon

Go tell the Count Rossillion and my brother

We have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled

Till we do hear from them

He will betray us all unto ourselves

Inform on that

Till then I'll keep him dark and safely locked

You have not given him his mother's

letter

He has much worthy blame laid upon him

for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady

When you have spoken it 'tis dead and I

am the grave of it

Now God delay our rebellion As we are

ourselves what things are we

Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters

of our unlawful intents We shall not then

have his company tonight

That approaches apace I would gladly

have him see his company anatomized that he

might take a measure of his own judgments

wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit

In the meantime what hear you of these

wars

Nay I assure you a peace concluded

I perceive by this demand you are not altogether

of his counsel

Sir his wife some two months since fled

from his house Her pretense is a pilgrimage to

Saint Jaques le Grand which holy undertaking

with most austere sanctimony she accomplished

And there residing the tenderness of her nature

became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan

of her last breath and now she sings in heaven

The stronger part of it by her own letters

which makes her story true even to the point of her

death Her death itself which could not be her

office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by

the rector of the place

Ay and the particular confirmations point

from point to the full arming of the verity

How mightily sometimes we make us

comforts of our losses

The web of our life is of a mingled yarn

good and ill together Our virtues would be proud

if our faults whipped them not and our crimes

would despair if they were not cherished by our

virtues

How now Where's your master

Hush hush Hoodman

You're deceived my

lord This is Monsieur Parolles the gallant

militaristthat was his own phrasethat had the

whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf and

the practice in the chape of his dagger

He's very near the truth in this

Nothing but let him have thanks

Demand of him my condition

and what credit I have with the Duke

Nay look not so upon

me We shall hear of your Lordship anon

Excellently

I begin to love him for this

He hath out-villained villainy so

far that the rarity redeems him

God save you noble captain

Good captain will you give me a copy of

the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count

Rossillion An I were not a very coward I'd compel

it of you But fare you well
