Cry Trojans

Cry Trojans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes

And I will fill them with prophetic tears

Virgins and boys mid-age and wrinkled elders

Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry

Add to my clamors Let us pay betimes

A moiety of that mass of moan to come

Cry Trojans cry Practice your eyes with tears

Troy must not be nor goodly Ilium stand

Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all

Cry Trojans cry A Helen and a woe

Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go

Where is my brother Hector

O 'tis true

No notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother

The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows

They are polluted off'rings more abhorred

Than spotted livers in the sacrifice

It is the purpose that makes strong the vow

But vows to every purpose must not hold

Unarm sweet Hector

Lay hold upon him Priam hold him fast

He is thy crutch Now if thou loose thy stay

Thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee

Fall all together

O Priam yield not to him

O farewell dear Hector

Look how thou diest Look how thy eye turns pale

Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents

Hark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries out

How poor Andromache shrills her dolor forth

Behold distraction frenzy and amazement

Like witless antics one another meet

And all cry Hector Hector's dead O Hector

FarewellYet soft Hector I take my leave

Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive
