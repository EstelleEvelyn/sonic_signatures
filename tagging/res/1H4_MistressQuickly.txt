Marry my lord there is a nobleman of the

court at door would speak with you He says he

comes from your father

An old man

O Jesu this is excellent sport i' faith

O the Father how he holds his countenance

O Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry

players as ever I see

O Jesu my lord my lord

The Sheriff and all the watch are at the door

They are come to search the house Shall I let them

in

Why Sir John what do you think Sir John

do you think I keep thieves in my house I have

searched I have enquired so has my husband

man by man boy by boy servant by servant

The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house

before

Who I No I defy thee God's light I was

never called so in mine own house before

No Sir John you do not know me Sir John I

know you Sir John You owe me money Sir John

and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it I

bought you a dozen of shirts to your back

Now as I am a true woman holland of eight

shillings an ell You owe money here besides Sir

John for your diet and by-drinkings and money

lent you four-and-twenty pound

He Alas he is poor He hath nothing

O Jesu I have heard the Prince

tell him I know not how oft that that ring was

copper

My lord I pray you hear me

Good my lord hear me

So I told him my lord and I said I heard

your Grace say so And my lord he speaks most

vilely of you like a foul-mouthed man as he is and

said he would cudgel you

There's neither faith truth nor womanhood

in me else

Say what thing what thing

I am no thing to thank God on I would thou

shouldst know it I am an honest man's wife and

setting thy knighthood aside thou art a knave to

call me so

Say what beast thou knave thou

Thou art an unjust man in saying so Thou or

any man knows where to have me thou knave

thou

So he doth you my lord and said this other

day you owed him a thousand pound

Nay my lord he called you jack and said

he would cudgel you
