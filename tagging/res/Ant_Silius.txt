Noble Ventidius

Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm

The fugitive Parthians follow Spur through Media

Mesopotamia and the shelters whither

The routed fly So thy grand captain Antony

Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and

Put garlands on thy head

Thou hast Ventidius that

Without the which a soldier and his sword

Grants scarce distinction Thou wilt write to Antony

Where is he now
