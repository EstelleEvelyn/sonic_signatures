


To gratify the good Andronicus

And gratulate his safe return to Rome

The people will accept whom he admits

Lucius all hail Rome's royal emperor

Lucius all hail Rome's gracious governor

You sad Andronici have done with woes

Give sentence on this execrable wretch

That hath been breeder of these dire events
