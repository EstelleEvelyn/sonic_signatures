That holds in chase mine honor up and down

Sir Robert's son Ay thou unreverent boy

Sir Robert's son Why scorn'st thou at Sir Robert

He is Sir Robert's son and so art thou

Hast thou conspird with thy brother too

That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honor

What means this scorn thou most untoward knave

Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge

King Richard Coeur de Lion was thy father

By long and vehement suit I was seduced

To make room for him in my husband's bed

Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge

Thou art the issue of my dear offense

Which was so strongly urged past my defense
