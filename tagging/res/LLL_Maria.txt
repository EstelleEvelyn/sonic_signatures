Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir

Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnizèd

In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.

A man of sovereign parts he is esteemed,

Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms.

Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.

The only soil of his fair virtue’s gloss,

If virtue’s gloss will stain with any soil,

Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,

Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills

It should none spare that come within his power.

They say so most that most his humors know.

That last is Berowne, the merry madcap lord.

Not a word with him but a jest.

Thou art an old lovemonger and speakest skillfully.

No.

Ay, our way to be gone.

You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow.

A mark marvelous well shot, for they both did hit it.

Wide o’ the bow hand! I’ faith, your hand is out.

Come, come, you talk greasily. Your lips grow foul.

This, and these pearls, to me sent Longaville.

The letter is too long by half a mile.

Ay, or I would these hands might never part.

Folly in fools bears not so strong a note

As fool’ry in the wise, when wit doth dote,

Since all the power thereof it doth apply

To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

Name it.

Say you so? Fair lord!

Take that for your “fair lady.”

Dumaine was at my service, and his sword.

“No point,” quoth I. My servant straight was mute.

Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.

At the twelvemonth’s end

I’ll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

The liker you; few taller are so young.
