


But how my lord shall we resist it now

This would drink deep

But what prevention

And a true lover of the holy Church

We are blessd in the change

The strawberry grows underneath the nettle

And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best

Neighbored by fruit of baser quality

And so the Prince obscured his contemplation

Under the veil of wildness which no doubt

Grew like the summer grass fastest by night

Unseen yet crescive in his faculty

But my good lord

How now for mitigation of this bill

Urged by the Commons Doth his Majesty

Incline to it or no

How did this offer seem received my lord

What was th' impediment that broke this off

It is

I'll wait upon you and I long to hear it

Awake remembrance of these valiant dead

And with your puissant arm renew their feats

You are their heir you sit upon their throne

The blood and courage that renownd them

Runs in your veins and my thrice-puissant liege

Is in the very May-morn of his youth

Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises

But there's a saying very old and true 

If that you will France win

Then with Scotland first begin

For once the eagle England being in prey

To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot

Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs

Playing the mouse in absence of the cat

To 'tame and havoc more than she can eat
