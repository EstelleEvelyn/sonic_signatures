The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.

Dishonorable boy,

That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword

That it shall render vengeance and revenge

Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie

In earth as quiet as thy father’s skull.

In proof whereof, there is my honor’s pawn.

Engage it to the trial if thou dar’st.
