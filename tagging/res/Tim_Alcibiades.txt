


Sir you have saved my longing and I feed

Most hungerly on your sight

My heart is ever at your service my lord

So they were bleeding new my lord

there's no meat like 'em I could wish my best

friend at such a feast

So are we all

Ay defiled land my lord

Honor health and compassion to the Senate

I am an humble suitor to your virtues

For pity is the virtue of the law

And none but tyrants use it cruelly

It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy

Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood

Hath stepped into the law which is past depth

To those that without heed do plunge into 't

He is a mansetting his fate aside

Of comely virtues

Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice

An honor in him which buys out his fault

But with a noble fury and fair spirit

Seeing his reputation touched to death

He did oppose his foe

And with such sober and unnoted passion

He did behave his anger ere 'twas spent

As if he had but proved an argument

My lord

My lords then under favor pardon me

If I speak like a captain

Why do fond men expose themselves to battle

And not endure all threats Sleep upon 't

And let the foes quietly cut their throats

Without repugnancy If there be

Such valor in the bearing what make we

Abroad Why then women are more valiant

That stay at home if bearing carry it

And the ass more captain than the lion the felon

Loaden with irons wiser than the judge

If wisdom be in suffering O my lords

As you are great be pitifully good

Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood

To kill I grant is sin's extremest gust

But in defense by mercy 'tis most just

To be in anger is impiety

But who is man that is not angry

Weigh but the crime with this

In vain His service done

At Lacedaemon and Byzantium

Were a sufficient briber for his life

Why I say my lords has done fair service

And slain in fight many of your enemies

How full of valor did he bear himself

In the last conflict and made plenteous wounds

Hard fate He might have died in war

My lords if not for any parts in him

Though his right arm might purchase his own time

And be in debt to noneyet more to move you

Take my deserts to his and join 'em both

And for I know your reverend ages love

Security I'll pawn my victories all

My honor to you upon his good returns

If by this crime he owes the law his life

Why let the war receive 't in valiant gore

For law is strict and war is nothing more

Must it be so It must not be

My lords I do beseech you know me

Call me to your remembrances

I cannot think but your age has forgot me

It could not else be I should prove so base

To sue and be denied such common grace

My wounds ache at you

Banish me

Banish your dotage banish usury

That makes the Senate ugly

Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live

Only in bone that none may look on you

I'm worse than mad I have kept back their foes

While they have told their money and let out

Their coin upon large interest I myself

Rich only in large hurts All those for this

Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate

Pours into captains' wounds Banishment

It comes not ill I hate not to be banished

It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury

That I may strike at Athens I'll cheer up

My discontented troops and lay for hearts

'Tis honor with most lands to be at odds

Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods

What art thou there Speak

What is thy name Is man so hateful to thee

That art thyself a man

I know thee well

But in thy fortunes am unlearned and strange

How came the noble Timon to this change

Noble Timon what friendship may I do thee

What is it Timon

I have heard in some sort of thy miseries

I see them now Then was a blessd time

Pardon him sweet Timandra for his wits

Are drowned and lost in his calamities

I have but little gold of late brave Timon

The want whereof doth daily make revolt

In my penurious band I have heard and grieved

How cursd Athens mindless of thy worth

Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbor states

But for thy sword and fortune trod upon them

I am thy friend and pity thee dear Timon

Why fare thee well Here is some gold for thee

When I have laid proud Athens on a heap

Ay Timon and have cause

Why me Timon

Hast thou gold yet I'll take the gold thou givest me

Not all thy counsel

Strike up the drum towards AthensFarewell Timon

If I thrive well I'll visit thee again

I never did thee harm

Call'st thou that harm

We but offend him

Strike

Sound to this coward and lascivious town

Our terrible approach

Till now you have gone on and filled the time

With all licentious measure making your wills

The scope of justice Till now myself and such

As slept within the shadow of your power

Have wandered with our traversed arms and breathed

Our sufferance vainly Now the time is flush

When crouching marrow in the bearer strong

Cries of itself No more Now breathless wrong

Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease

And pursy insolence shall break his wind

With fear and horrid flight

Then there's my glove

Descend and open your unchargd ports

Those enemies of Timon's and mine own

Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof

Fall and no more And to atone your fears

With my more noble meaning not a man

Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream

Of regular justice in your city's bounds

But shall be remedied to your public laws

At heaviest answer

Descend and keep your words

Here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft

Seek not my name A plague consume you wicked caitiffs left

Here lie I Timon who alive all living men did hate

Pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy gait

These well express in thee thy latter spirits

Though thou abhorred'st in us our human griefs

Scorned'st our brains' flow and those our droplets which

From niggard nature fall yet rich conceit

Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye

On thy low grave on faults forgiven Dead

Is noble Timon of whose memory

Hereafter more Bring me into your city

And I will use the olive with my sword

Make war breed peace make peace stint war make each

Prescribe to other as each other's leech

Let our drums strike
