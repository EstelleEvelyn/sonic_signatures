Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.

Cassio?

I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.

What, of Venice?

Know him? Ay.

I am glad to see you.

Roderigo?

What is the matter?

O heavens forfend!

’Tis a strange truth.

Poor Desdemon, I am glad thy father’s dead.

Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief

Shore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,

This sight would make him do a desperate turn,

Yea, curse his better angel from his side,

And fall to reprobance.

Fie, your sword upon a woman!

The woman falls! Sure he hath killed his wife.

He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.

If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;

Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.

What is the matter?

Torments will ope your lips.

All that is spoke is marred.
