


Nay'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping

All the kind of the Lances have this very fault I have

received my proportion like the Prodigious Son and

am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's court I

think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that

lives my mother weeping my father wailing my

sister crying our maid howling our cat wringing

her hands and all our house in a great perplexity

yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear He

is a stone a very pibble stone and has no more pity

in him than a dog A Jew would have wept to have

seen our parting Why my grandam having no

eyes look you wept herself blind at my parting

Nay I'll show you the manner of it

This shoe is my father No this left shoe is

my father no no this left shoe is my mother Nay

that cannot be so neither Yes it is so it is so it hath

the worser sole This shoe with the hole in it is my

mother and this my father A vengeance on 't there

'tis Now sir this staff is my sister for look you she

is as white as a lily and as small as a wand This hat

is Nan our maid I am the dog No the dog is

himself and I am the dog O the dog is me and I

am myself Ay so so Now come I to my father

Father your blessing Now should not the shoe

speak a word for weeping Now should I kiss my

father Well he weeps on Now

come I to my mother O that she could speak now

like a wold woman Well I kiss her

Why there 'tis here's my mother's

breath up and down Now come I to my sister Mark

the moan she makes Now the dog all this while

sheds not a tear nor speaks a word But see how I

lay the dust with my tears

It is no matter if the tied were lost for it is the

unkindest tied that ever any man tied

Why he that's tied here Crab my dog

For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue

In thy tale

Lose the tide and the voyage and the master

and the service and the tied Why man if the river

were dry I am able to fill it with my tears if the

wind were down I could drive the boat with my

sighs

Sir call me what thou dar'st

Well I will go

Forswear not thyself sweet youth for I am not

welcome I reckon this always that a man is never

undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a

place till some certain shot be paid and the Hostess

say welcome

Marry after they closed in earnest they parted

very fairly in jest

No

No neither

No they are both as whole as a fish

Marry thus when it stands well with him it

stands well with her

What a block art thou that thou canst not My

staff understands me

Ay and what I do too Look thee I'll but lean

and my staff understands me

Why stand under and understand is all

one

Ask my dog If he say Ay it will if he say

No it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it

will

Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but

by a parable

I never knew him otherwise

A notable lubber as thou reportest him to be

Why fool I meant not thee I meant thy master

Why I tell thee I care not though he burn

himself in love If thou wilt go with me to the

alehouse if not thou art an Hebrew a Jew and not

worth the name of a Christian

Because thou hast not so much charity in thee

as to go to the ale with a Christian Wilt thou go

So-ho so-ho

Him we go to find There's not a hair on 's head

but 'tis a Valentine

Can nothing speak Master shall I strike

Nothing

Why sir I'll strike nothing I pray you

Sir there is a proclamation that you are

vanished

I am but a fool look you and yet I have the wit

to think my master is a kind of a knave but that's all

one if he be but one knave He lives not now that

knows me to be in love yet I am in love but a team

of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who 'tis I

love and yet 'tis a woman but what woman I will

not tell myself and yet 'tis a milk-maid yet 'tis not a

maid for she hath had gossips yet 'tis a maid for

she is her master's maid and serves for wages She

hath more qualities than a water spaniel which is

much in a bare Christian

Here is the catalog of her condition

Imprimis She can fetch and carry Why a

horse can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but

only carry therefore is she better than a jade

Item She can milk Look you a sweet

virtue in a maid with clean hands

With my master's ship Why it is at sea

The black'st news that ever thou heard'st

Why as black as ink

Fie on thee jolt-head thou canst not read

I will try thee Tell me this who begot thee

O illiterate loiterer it was the son of thy grandmother

This proves that thou canst not read

There and Saint Nicholas

be thy speed

Ay that she can

And thereof comes the proverb Blessing of

your heart you brew good ale

That's as much as to say Can she so

What need a man care for a stock with a wench

when she can knit him a stock

A special virtue for then she need not be

washed and scoured

Then may I set the world on wheels when she

can spin for her living

That's as much as to say bastard virtues that

indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no

names

Close at the heels of her virtues

Well that fault may be mended with a breakfast

Read on

That makes amends for her sour breath

It's no matter for that so she sleep not in her

talk

O villain that set this down among her vices To

be slow in words is a woman's only virtue I pray

thee out with 't and place it for her chief virtue

Out with that too it was Eve's legacy and

cannot be ta'en from her

I care not for that neither because I love crusts

Well the best is she hath no teeth to bite

If her liquor be good she shall if she will not I

will for good things should be praised

Of her tongue she cannot for that's writ down

she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that I'll

keep shut now of another thing she may and that

cannot I help Well proceed

Stop there I'll have her She was mine and not

mine twice or thrice in that last article Rehearse

that once more

More hair than wit It may be I'll prove it

the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is

more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is

more than the wit for the greater hides the less

What's next

That's monstrous O that that were out

Why that word makes the faults gracious Well

I'll have her and if it be a match as nothing is

impossible

Why then will I tell thee that thy master stays

for thee at the North Gate

For thee Ay who art thou He hath stayed for a

better man than thee

Thou must run to him for thou hast stayed so

long that going will scarce serve the turn

Now will he be swinged for reading my letter

an unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into

secrets I'll after to rejoice in the boy's correction

When a man's servant shall play the cur with

him look you it goes hardone that I brought up

of a puppy one that I saved from drowning when

three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went

to it I have taught him even as one would say

precisely Thus I would teach a dog I was sent to

deliver him as a present to Mistress Sylvia from my

master and I came no sooner into the dining

chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals

her capon's leg O 'tis a foul thing when a cur

cannot keep himself in all companies I would have

as one should say one that takes upon him to be a

dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I

had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon

me that he did I think verily he had been hanged

for 't Sure as I live he had suffered for 't You shall

judge He thrusts me himself into the company of

three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Duke's

table he had not been therebless the marka

pissing while but all the chamber smelt him Out

with the dog says one What cur is that says

another Whip him out says the third Hang him

up says the Duke I having been acquainted with

the smell before knew it was Crab and goes me to

the fellow that whips the dogs Friend quoth I

You mean to whip the dog Ay marry do I

quoth he You do him the more wrong quoth I

'Twas I did the thing you wot of He makes me no

more ado but whips me out of the chamber How

many masters would do this for his servant Nay

I'll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he

hath stolen otherwise he had been executed I have

stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed otherwise

he had suffered for 't Thou think'st

not of this now Nay I remember the trick you

served me when I took my leave of Madam Sylvia

Did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do

When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make

water against a gentlewoman's farthingale Didst

thou ever see me do such a trick

Marry sir I carried Mistress Sylvia the dog you

bade me

Marry she says your dog was a cur and tells

you currish thanks is good enough for such a

present

No indeed did she not Here have I brought

him back again

Ay sir The other squirrel was stolen from me

by the hangman's boys in the market-place and

then I offered her mine own who is a dog as big as

ten of yours and therefore the gift the greater
