I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.

I strike quickly, being moved.

A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I

will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.

’Tis true, and therefore women, being the

weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore

I will push Montague’s men from the wall and

thrust his maids to the wall.

’Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.

When I have fought with the men, I will be civil

with the maids; I will cut off their heads.

Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.

Take it in what sense thou wilt.

Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,

and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back

thee.

Fear me not.

Let us take the law of our sides; let them

begin.

Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at

them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.

I do bite my thumb, sir.

Is the law of our side if I

say “Ay”?

No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,

but I bite my thumb, sir.

But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as

good a man as you.

Well, sir.

Yes, better, sir.

Draw if you be men.—Gregory, remember

thy washing blow.
