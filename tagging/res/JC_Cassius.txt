


Fellow, come from the throng.  Look upon Caesar.

Will you go see the order of the course?

I pray you, do.

Brutus, I do observe you now of late.

I have not from your eyes that gentleness

And show of love as I was wont to have.

You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand

Over your friend that loves you.

Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,

By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried

Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.

Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

’Tis just.

And it is very much lamented, Brutus,

That you have no such mirrors as will turn

Your hidden worthiness into your eye,

That you might see your shadow. I have heard

Where many of the best respect in Rome,

Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus

And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,

Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.

Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.

And since you know you cannot see yourself

So well as by reflection, I, your glass,

Will modestly discover to yourself

That of yourself which you yet know not of.

And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.

Were I a common laughter, or did use

To stale with ordinary oaths my love

To every new protester; if you know

That I do fawn on men and hug them hard

And after scandal them, or if you know

That I profess myself in banqueting

To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

Ay, do you fear it?

Then must I think you would not have it so.

I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,

As well as I do know your outward favor.

Well, honor is the subject of my story.

I cannot tell what you and other men

Think of this life; but, for my single self,

I had as lief not be as live to be

In awe of such a thing as I myself.

I was born free as Caesar; so were you;

We both have fed as well, and we can both

Endure the winter’s cold as well as he.

For once, upon a raw and gusty day,

The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,

Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now

Leap in with me into this angry flood

And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,

Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in

And bade him follow; so indeed he did.

The torrent roared, and we did buffet it

With lusty sinews, throwing it aside

And stemming it with hearts of controversy.

But ere we could arrive the point proposed,

Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”

I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,

Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder

The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber

Did I the tired Caesar. And this man

Is now become a god, and Cassius is

A wretched creature and must bend his body

If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.

He had a fever when he was in Spain,

And when the fit was on him, I did mark

How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake.

His coward lips did from their color fly,

And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world

Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.

Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans

Mark him and write his speeches in their books,

“Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius”

As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me

A man of such a feeble temper should

So get the start of the majestic world

And bear the palm alone.

Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world

Like a Colossus, and we petty men

Walk under his huge legs and peep about

To find ourselves dishonorable graves.

Men at some time are masters of their fates.

The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,

But in ourselves, that we are underlings.

“Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”?

Why should that name be sounded more than yours?

Write them together, yours is as fair a name;

Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;

Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,

“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”

Now, in the names of all the gods at once,

Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed

That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!

Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!

When went there by an age, since the great flood,

But it was famed with more than with one man?

When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,

That her wide walks encompassed but one man?

Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough

When there is in it but one only man.

O, you and I have heard our fathers say

There was a Brutus once that would have brooked

Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome

As easily as a king.

I am glad that my weak words

Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,

And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you

What hath proceeded worthy note today.

Casca will tell us what the matter is.

They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?

Who offered him the crown?

But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?

No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I

And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

Did Cicero say anything?

To what effect?

Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?

Will you dine with me tomorrow?

Good. I will expect you.

So is he now in execution

Of any bold or noble enterprise,

However he puts on this tardy form.

This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,

Which gives men stomach to digest his words

With better appetite.

I will do so. Till then, think of the world.

Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see

Thy honorable mettle may be wrought

From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet

That noble minds keep ever with their likes;

For who so firm that cannot be seduced?

Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.

If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,

He should not humor me. I will this night

In several hands in at his windows throw,

As if they came from several citizens,

Writings, all tending to the great opinion

That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely

Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at

And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,

For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

Who’s there?

Casca, by your voice.

A very pleasing night to honest men.

Those that have known the Earth so full of faults.

For my part, I have walked about the streets,

Submitting me unto the perilous night,

And thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see,

Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;

And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open

The breast of heaven, I did present myself

Even in the aim and very flash of it.

You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life

That should be in a Roman you do want,

Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,

And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,

To see the strange impatience of the heavens.

But if you would consider the true cause

Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,

Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,

Why old men, fools, and children calculate,

Why all these things change from their ordinance,

Their natures, and preformèd faculties,

To monstrous quality—why, you shall find

That heaven hath infused them with these spirits

To make them instruments of fear and warning

Unto some monstrous state.

Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man

Most like this dreadful night,

That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars

As doth the lion in the Capitol;

A man no mightier than thyself or me

In personal action, yet prodigious grown,

And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.

Let it be who it is. For Romans now

Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.

But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,

And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits.

Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

I know where I will wear this dagger then;

Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.

Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong;

Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat.

Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,

Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,

Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;

But life, being weary of these worldly bars,

Never lacks power to dismiss itself.

If I know this, know all the world besides,

That part of tyranny that I do bear

I can shake off at pleasure.

And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?

Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf

But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;

He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.

Those that with haste will make a mighty fire

Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,

What rubbish, and what offal when it serves

For the base matter to illuminate

So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,

Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this

Before a willing bondman; then, I know

My answer must be made. But I am armed,

And dangers are to me indifferent.

There’s a bargain made.

Now know you, Casca, I have moved already

Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans

To undergo with me an enterprise

Of honorable-dangerous consequence.

And I do know by this they stay for me

In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night,

There is no stir or walking in the streets;

And the complexion of the element

In favor ’s like the work we have in hand,

Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait.

He is a friend.—Cinna, where haste you so?

No, it is Casca, one incorporate

To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?

Am I not stayed for? Tell me.

Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,

And look you lay it in the Praetor’s chair,

Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this

In at his window; set this up with wax

Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,

Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.

Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

That done, repair to Pompey’s Theater.

Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day

See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him

Is ours already, and the man entire

Upon the next encounter yields him ours.

Him and his worth and our great need of him

You have right well conceited. Let us go,

For it is after midnight, and ere day

We will awake him and be sure of him.

I think we are too bold upon your rest.

Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?

Yes, every man of them; and no man here

But honors you, and every one doth wish

You had but that opinion of yourself

Which every noble Roman bears of you.

This is Trebonius.

This, Decius Brutus.

This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

Shall I entreat a word?

And let us swear our resolution.

But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?

I think he will stand very strong with us.

Then leave him out.

Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet

Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,

Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him

A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,

If he improve them, may well stretch so far

As to annoy us all; which to prevent,

Let Antony and Caesar fall together.

Yet I fear him,

For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar—

The clock hath stricken three.

But it is doubtful yet

Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,

For he is superstitious grown of late,

Quite from the main opinion he held once

Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.

It may be these apparent prodigies,

The unaccustomed terror of this night,

And the persuasion of his augurers

May hold him from the Capitol today.

Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

The morning comes upon ’s. We’ll leave you, Brutus.

And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember

What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.

What, urge you your petitions in the street?

Come to the Capitol.

What enterprise, Popilius?

He wished today our enterprise might thrive.

I fear our purpose is discoverèd.

Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.—

Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,

Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,

For I will slay myself.

Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,

He draws Mark Antony out of the way.

 Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon!

As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall

To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

Some to the common pulpits and cry out

“Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.”

And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,

Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.

Where is Antony?

Stoop then, and wash.  How many ages hence

Shall this our lofty scene be acted over

In states unborn and accents yet unknown!

So oft as that shall be,

So often shall the knot of us be called

The men that gave their country liberty.

Ay, every man away.

Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels

With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

I wish we may; but yet have I a mind

That fears him much, and my misgiving still

Falls shrewdly to the purpose.

Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s

In the disposing of new dignities.

Mark Antony—

I blame you not for praising Caesar so.

But what compact mean you to have with us?

Will you be pricked in number of our friends,

Or shall we on and not depend on you?

Brutus, a word with you.

You know not what you do. Do not consent

That Antony speak in his funeral.

Know you how much the people may be moved

By that which he will utter?

I know not what may fall. I like it not.

Stand ho!

Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,

And when you do them—

Pindarus,

Bid our commanders lead their charges off

A little from this ground.

That you have wronged me doth appear in this:

You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella

For taking bribes here of the Sardians,

Wherein my letters, praying on his side

Because I knew the man, was slighted off.

In such a time as this it is not meet

That every nice offense should bear his comment.

I an itching palm?

You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,

Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

Chastisement?

Brutus, bait not me.

I’ll not endure it. You forget yourself

To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,

Older in practice, abler than yourself

To make conditions.

I am.

Urge me no more. I shall forget myself.

Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther.

Is ’t possible?

O you gods, you gods, must I endure all this?

Is it come to this?

You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.

I said an elder soldier, not a better.

Did I say “better”?

When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me.

I durst not?

What? Durst not tempt him?

Do not presume too much upon my love.

I may do that I shall be sorry for.

I denied you not.

I did not. He was but a fool that brought

My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.

A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities,

But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

You love me not.

A friendly eye could never see such faults.

Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come!

Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,

For Cassius is aweary of the world—

Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother,

Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed,

Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote

To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep

My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,

And here my naked breast; within, a heart

Dearer than Pluto’s mine, richer than gold.

If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth.

I that denied thee gold will give my heart.

Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know

When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better

Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

Hath Cassius lived

To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus

When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?

Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.

O Brutus!

Have not you love enough to bear with me

When that rash humor which my mother gave me

Makes me forgetful?

How now, what’s the matter?

Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!

Bear with him, Brutus. ’Tis his fashion.

Away, away, be gone!

And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you

Immediately to us.

I did not think you could have been so angry.

Of your philosophy you make no use

If you give place to accidental evils.

Ha? Portia?

How ’scaped I killing when I crossed you so?

O insupportable and touching loss!

Upon what sickness?

And died so?

O you immortal gods!

My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.—

Fill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup;

I cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.

Portia, art thou gone?

Cicero one?

I have as much of this in art as you,

But yet my nature could not bear it so.

I do not think it good.

This it is:

’Tis better that the enemy seek us;

So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,

Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still,

Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.

Hear me, good brother—

Then, with your will, go on;

We’ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.

No more. Good night.

Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

O my dear brother,

This was an ill beginning of the night.

Never come such division ’tween our souls!

Let it not, Brutus.

Good night, my lord.

Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk.

Antony,

The posture of your blows are yet unknown,

But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees

And leave them honeyless.

Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself!

This tongue had not offended so today

If Cassius might have ruled.

A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor,

Joined with a masker and a reveler!

Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!

The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.

Messala.

Messala,

This is my birthday, as this very day

Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.

Be thou my witness that against my will

(As Pompey was) am I compelled to set

Upon one battle all our liberties.

You know that I held Epicurus strong

And his opinion. Now I change my mind

And partly credit things that do presage.

Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign

Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched,

Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,

Who to Philippi here consorted us.

This morning are they fled away and gone,

And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites

Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us

As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem

A canopy most fatal, under which

Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.

I but believe it partly,

For I am fresh of spirit and resolved

To meet all perils very constantly.

Now, most noble Brutus,

The gods today stand friendly that we may,

Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.

But since the affairs of men rests still incertain,

Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.

If we do lose this battle, then is this

The very last time we shall speak together.

What are you then determinèd to do?

Then, if we lose this battle,

You are contented to be led in triumph

Thorough the streets of Rome?

Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.

If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;

If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.

O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!

Myself have to mine own turned enemy.

This ensign here of mine was turning back;

I slew the coward and did take it from him.

This hill is far enough.—Look, look, Titinius,

Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?

Titinius, if thou lovest me,

Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him

Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops

And here again, that I may rest assured

Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.

Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.

My sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius

And tell me what thou not’st about the field.

This day I breathèd first. Time is come round,

And where I did begin, there shall I end;

My life is run his compass.—Sirrah, what news?

What news?

Come down, behold no more.—

O, coward that I am to live so long

To see my best friend ta’en before my face!

Come hither, sirrah.

In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,

And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,

That whatsoever I did bid thee do

Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath.

Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,

That ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom.

Stand not to answer. Here, take thou the hilts,

And, when my face is covered, as ’tis now,

Guide thou the sword. Caesar, thou art revenged

Even with the sword that killed thee.
