
Caesar I shall

Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt

And bids thee study on what fair demands

Thou mean'st to have him grant thee

My name is Proculeius

Be of good cheer

You're fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing

Make your full reference freely to my lord

Who is so full of grace that it flows over

On all that need Let me report to him

Your sweet dependency and you shall find

A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness

Where he for grace is kneeled to

This I'll report dear lady

Have comfort for I know your plight is pitied

Of him that caused it

Hold worthy lady hold

Do not yourself such wrong who are in this

Relieved but not betrayed

Cleopatra

Do not abuse my master's bounty by

Th' undoing of yourself Let the world see

His nobleness well acted which your death

Will never let come forth

O temperance lady

You do extend

These thoughts of horror further than you shall

Find cause in Caesar

So Dolabella

It shall content me best Be gentle to her

To Caesar I will speak what you shall please

If you'll employ me to him

Make way there Caesar

A way there a way for Caesar
