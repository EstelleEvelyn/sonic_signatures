


I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord

Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask

To fright our party

Douglas is living and your brother yet

But for my lord your son

You are too great to be by me gainsaid

Your spirit is too true your fears too certain

I am sorry I should force you to believe

That which I would to God I had not seen

But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state

Rend'ring faint quittance wearied and outbreathed

To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down

The never-daunted Percy to the earth

From whence with life he never more sprung up

In few his death whose spirit lent a fire

Even to the dullest peasant in his camp

Being bruited once took fire and heat away

From the best-tempered courage in his troops

For from his mettle was his party steeled

Which once in him abated all the rest

Turned on themselves like dull and heavy lead

And as the thing that's heavy in itself

Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed

So did our men heavy in Hotspur's loss

Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear

That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim

Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety

Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester

So soon ta'en prisoner and that furious Scot

The bloody Douglas whose well-laboring sword

Had three times slain th' appearance of the King

Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame

Of those that turned their backs and in his flight

Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all

Is that the King hath won and hath sent out

A speedy power to encounter you my lord

Under the conduct of young Lancaster

And Westmoreland This is the news at full

Sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honor

The lives of all your loving complices

Lean on your health the which if you give o'er

To stormy passion must perforce decay

You cast th' event of war my noble lord

And summed the accompt of chance before you said

Let us make head It was your presurmise

That in the dole of blows your son might drop

You knew he walked o'er perils on an edge

More likely to fall in than to get o'er

You were advised his flesh was capable

Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit

Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged

Yet did you say Go forth and none of this

Though strongly apprehended could restrain

The stiff-borne action What hath then befall'n

Or what did this bold enterprise bring forth

More than that being which was like to be

'Tis more than timeAnd my most noble lord

I hear for certain and dare speak the truth

The gentle Archbishop of York is up

With well-appointed powers He is a man

Who with a double surety binds his followers

My lord your son had only but the corpse

But shadows and the shows of men to fight

For that same word rebellion did divide

The action of their bodies from their souls

And they did fight with queasiness constrained

As men drink potions that their weapons only

Seemed on our side But for their spirits and souls

This word rebellion it had froze them up

As fish are in a pond But now the Bishop

Turns insurrection to religion

Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts

He's followed both with body and with mind

And doth enlarge his rising with the blood

Of fair King Richard scraped from Pomfret stones

Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause

Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land

Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke

And more and less do flock to follow him
