
Brutus my lord

Nor for yours neither You've ungently Brutus

Stole from my bed And yesternight at supper

You suddenly arose and walked about

Musing and sighing with your arms across

And when I asked you what the matter was

You stared upon me with ungentle looks

I urged you further then you scratched your head

And too impatiently stamped with your foot

Yet I insisted yet you answered not

But with an angry wafture of your hand

Gave sign for me to leave you So I did

Fearing to strengthen that impatience

Which seemed too much enkindled and withal

Hoping it was but an effect of humor

Which sometime hath his hour with every man

It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep

And could it work so much upon your shape

As it hath much prevailed on your condition

I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord

Make me acquainted with your cause of grief

Brutus is wise and were he not in health

He would embrace the means to come by it

Is Brutus sick And is it physical

To walk unbracd and suck up the humors

Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick

And will he steal out of his wholesome bed

To dare the vile contagion of the night

And tempt the rheumy and unpurgd air

To add unto his sickness No my Brutus

You have some sick offense within your mind

Which by the right and virtue of my place

I ought to know of And upon my knees

I charm you by my once commended beauty

By all your vows of love and that great vow

Which did incorporate and make us one

That you unfold to me your self your half

Why you are heavy and what men tonight

Have had resort to you for here have been

Some six or seven who did hide their faces

Even from darkness

I should not need if you were gentle Brutus

Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus

Is it excepted I should know no secrets

That appertain to you Am I your self

But as it were in sort or limitation

To keep with you at meals comfort your bed

And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs

Of your good pleasure If it be no more

Portia is Brutus' harlot not his wife

If this were true then should I know this secret

I grant I am a woman but withal

A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife

I grant I am a woman but withal

A woman well-reputed Cato's daughter

Think you I am no stronger than my sex

Being so fathered and so husbanded

Tell me your counsels I will not disclose 'em

I have made strong proof of my constancy

Giving myself a voluntary wound

Here in the thigh Can I bear that with patience

And not my husband's secrets

I prithee boy run to the Senate House

Stay not to answer me but get thee gone

Why dost thou stay

I would have had thee there and here again

Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there

O constancy be strong upon my side

Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue

I have a man's mind but a woman's might

How hard it is for women to keep counsel

Art thou here yet

Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well

For he went sickly forth And take good note

What Caesar doth what suitors press to him

Hark boy what noise is that

Prithee listen well

I heard a bustling rumor like a fray

And the wind brings it from the Capitol

Come hither fellow Which way hast thou been

What is 't o'clock

Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol

Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not

Why know'st thou any harm's intended towards him

I must go in Ay me how weak a thing

The heart of woman is O Brutus

The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise

Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit

That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint

Run Lucius and commend me to my lord

Say I am merry Come to me again

And bring me word what he doth say to thee
