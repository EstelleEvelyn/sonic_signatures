on the like occasion whereon my services

are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great

difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

Wherein our entertainment shall shame

us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed—

Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my

knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence—in

so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you

sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our

insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as

little accuse us.

Believe me, I speak as my understanding

instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to

utterance.

I think there is not in the world either

malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable

comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a

gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came

into my note.

Would they else be content to die?

If the King had no son, they would desire

to live on crutches till he had one.
