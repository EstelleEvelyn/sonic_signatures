Soothsayer

Show him your hand

Vex not his prescience Be attentive

Nay hear him

You think none but your sheets are privy to

your wishes

We'll know all our fortunes

Lo now if it lay in their hands to make me a

cuckold they would make themselves whores but

they'd do 't

Here at your service My lord approaches

Sovereign of Egypt hail

Last thing he did dear queen

He kissedthe last of many doubled kisses

This orient pearl His speech sticks in my heart

Good friend quoth he

Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends

This treasure of an oyster at whose foot

To mend the petty present I will piece

Her opulent throne with kingdoms All the East

Say thou shall call her mistress So he nodded

And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed

Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke

Was beastly dumbed by him

Like to the time o' th' year between th' extremes

Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry

Ay madam twenty several messengers

Why do you send so thick

The music ho

Half afeard to come

Good Majesty

Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you

But when you are well pleased
