


And shall, or him we will accompany.

He that would vouch it in any place but here.

Not I, till Mutius’ bones be burièd.

Father, and in that name doth nature speak—

No man shed tears for noble Mutius.

He lives in fame, that died in virtue’s cause.

And mine, I promise you. Were it not for shame,

Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.

O, brother, with the dismal’st object hurt

That ever eye with sight made heart lament!

Why dost not comfort me and help me out

From this unhallowed and bloodstainèd hole?

To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,

Aaron and thou look down into this den

And see a fearful sight of blood and death.

Lord Bassianus lies berayed in blood,

All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,

In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.

Upon his bloody finger he doth wear

A precious ring that lightens all this hole,

Which like a taper in some monument

Doth shine upon the dead man’s earthy cheeks

And shows the ragged entrails of this pit.

So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus

When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.

O, brother, help me with thy fainting hand—

If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath—

Out of this fell devouring receptacle,

As hateful as Cocytus’ misty mouth.

Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.

The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,

Brought hither in a most unlucky hour

To find thy brother Bassianus dead.

We know not where you left them all alive,

But, out alas, here have we found him dead.
