And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.

What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights,

Eightscore eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours

More tedious than the dial eightscore times?

O weary reck’ning!

O, Cassio, whence came this?

This is some token from a newer friend.

To the felt absence now I feel a cause.

Is ’t come to this? Well, well.

Why, whose is it?

Leave you? Wherefore?

Why, I pray you?

But that you do not love me!

I pray you bring me on the way a little,

And say if I shall see you soon at night.

’Tis very good. I must be circumstanced.

Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did

you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me

even now? I was a fine fool to take it! I must take

out the work? A likely piece of work, that you

should find it in your chamber and know not who

left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must

take out the work! There, give it your hobbyhorse.

Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.

If you’ll come to supper tonight you may. If

you will not, come when you are next prepared

for.

What is the matter, ho? Who is ’t that cried?

O, my dear Cassio,

My sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

Alas, he faints. O, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

He supped at my house, but I therefore shake not.

I am no strumpet, but of life as honest

As you that thus abuse me.

O heavens forfend!
