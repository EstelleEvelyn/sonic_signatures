hurt him?

The villain would not stand me.

I would they had not come between us.

And that she should love this fellow and

refuse me!

Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had

been some hurt done!

You’ll go with us?

Nay, come, let’s go together.

Was there ever man had such luck? When I

kissed the jack, upon an upcast to be hit away? I

had a hundred pound on ’t. And then a whoreson

jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I

borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend

them at my pleasure.

When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is

not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?

Whoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction. Would

he had been one of my rank.

I am not vexed more at anything in th’ Earth.

A pox on ’t! I had rather not be so noble as I am.

They dare not fight with me because of the Queen

my mother. Every jack-slave hath his bellyful of

fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock

that nobody can match.

Sayest thou?

No, I know that, but it is fit I should commit

offense to my inferiors.

Why, so I say.

A stranger, and I not know on ’t?

Leonatus? A banished rascal; and he’s another,

whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?

Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no

derogation in ’t?

Not easily, I think.

Come, I’ll go see this Italian. What I have lost

today at bowls I’ll win tonight of him. Come, go.

It would make any man cold to lose.

Winning will put any man into courage. If I

could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold

enough. It’s almost morning, is ’t not?

I would this music would come. I am advised

to give her music a-mornings; they say it will

penetrate.

Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your

fingering, so. We’ll try with tongue, too. If none

will do, let her remain, but I’ll never give o’er. First,

a very excellent good-conceited thing; after, a wonderful

sweet air, with admirable rich words to it,

and then let her consider.

So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will

consider your music the better. If it do not, it is a

vice in her ears which horsehairs and calves’

guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can

never amend.

I am glad I was up so late, for that’s the reason

I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this

service I have done fatherly.—Good morrow to

your Majesty and to my gracious mother.

I have assailed her with musics, but she

vouchsafes no notice.

Senseless? Not so.

If she be up, I’ll speak with her; if not,

Let her lie still and dream. By your leave, ho!—

I know her women are about her. What

If I do line one of their hands? ’Tis gold

Which buys admittance—oft it doth—yea, and makes

Diana’s rangers false themselves, yield up

Their deer to th’ stand o’ th’ stealer; and ’tis gold

Which makes the true man killed and saves the thief,

Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What

Can it not do and undo? I will make

One of her women lawyer to me, for

I yet not understand the case myself.

By your leave.

A gentleman.

Yes, and a gentlewoman’s son.

Your lady’s person. Is she ready?

There is gold for you.

Sell me your good report.

Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.

Still I swear I love you.

This is no answer.

To leave you in your madness ’twere my sin.

I will not.

Do you call me fool?

You sin against

Obedience, which you owe your father. For

The contract you pretend with that base wretch—

One bred of alms and fostered with cold dishes,

With scraps o’ th’ court—it is no contract, none;

And though it be allowed in meaner parties—

Yet who than he more mean?—to knit their souls,

On whom there is no more dependency

But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;

Yet you are curbed from that enlargement by

The consequence o’ th’ crown, and must not foil

The precious note of it with a base slave,

A hilding for a livery, a squire’s cloth,

A pantler—not so eminent.

The south fog rot him!

“His garment”? Now the devil—

“His garment”?

You have abused me.

“His meanest garment”?

I will inform your father.

I’ll be revenged! “His mean’st garment”? Well.

There be many Caesars

Ere such another Julius. Britain’s a world

By itself, and we will nothing pay

For wearing our own noses.

Come, there’s no more tribute to be paid. Our

kingdom is stronger than it was at that time, and,

as I said, there is no more such Caesars. Other of

them may have crooked noses, but to owe such

straight arms, none.

We have yet many among us can grip as hard

as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one, but I have a

hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If

Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or

put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute

for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

His Majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime

with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards

in other terms, you shall find us in our saltwater

girdle; if you beat us out of it, it is yours. If

you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the

better for you, and there’s an end.

Receive it friendly, but from this time forth

I wear it as your enemy.

’Tis all the better.

Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant

I have not seen these two days.

’Tis certain she is fled.

Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none

Dare come about him.

I love and hate her, for she’s fair and royal,

And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite

Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one

The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,

Outsells them all. I love her therefore, but

Disdaining me and throwing favors on

The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment

That what’s else rare is choked. And in that point

I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,

To be revenged upon her. For, when fools

Shall—    Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?

Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,

Where is thy lady? In a word, or else

Thou art straightway with the fiends.

Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter—

I will not ask again. Close villain,

I’ll have this secret from thy heart or rip

Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus,

From whose so many weights of baseness cannot

A dram of worth be drawn?

Where is she, sir? Come nearer.

No farther halting. Satisfy me home

What is become of her.

All-worthy villain!

Discover where thy mistress is at once,

At the next word. No more of “worthy lord”!

Speak, or thy silence on the instant is

Thy condemnation and thy death.

Let’s see ’t. I will pursue her

Even to Augustus’ throne.

Humh!

Sirrah, is this letter true?

It is Posthumus’ hand, I know ’t. Sirrah, if

thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,

undergo those employments wherein I should

have cause to use thee with a serious industry—

that is, what villainy soe’er I bid thee do to perform

it directly and truly—I would think thee an honest

man. Thou shouldst neither want my means for thy

relief nor my voice for thy preferment.

Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and

constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of

that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not in the

course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of

mine. Wilt thou serve me?

Give me thy hand. Here’s my purse.

Hast any of thy late master’s garments

in thy possession?

The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit

hither. Let it be thy first service. Go.

Meet thee at Milford Haven!—I forgot to ask

him one thing; I’ll remember ’t anon. Even there,

thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would

these garments were come. She said upon a time—

the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart—

that she held the very garment of Posthumus in

more respect than my noble and natural person,

together with the adornment of my qualities. With

that suit upon my back will I ravish her. First, kill

him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valor,

which will then be a torment to her contempt.

He on the ground, my speech of insultment

ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath

dined—which, as I say, to vex her I will execute

in the clothes that she so praised—to the court

I’ll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath

despised me rejoicingly, and I’ll be merry in my

revenge.

Be those the garments?

How long is ’t since she went to Milford Haven?

Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the

second thing that I have commanded thee. The

third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my

design. Be but duteous, and true preferment shall

tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford.

Would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.

I am near to th’ place where they should meet,

if Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments

serve me! Why should his mistress, who

was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit

too? The rather, saving reverence of the word, for

’tis said a woman’s fitness comes by fits. Therein I

must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself,

for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to

confer in his own chamber. I mean, the lines of my

body are as well drawn as his, no less young, more

strong; not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him

in the advantage of the time, above him in birth,

alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable

in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant

thing loves him in my despite. What

mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is

growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour

be off, thy mistress enforced, thy garments cut to

pieces before thy face; and all this done, spurn her

home to her father, who may haply be a little angry

or my so rough usage. But my mother, having

power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations.

My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword,

and to a sore purpose. Fortune, put them into my

hand! This is the very description of their meeting

place, and the fellow dares not deceive me.

I cannot find those runagates. That villain

Hath mocked me. I am faint.

Soft, what are you

That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?

I have heard of such.—What slave art thou?

Thou art a robber,

A lawbreaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.

Thou villain base,

Know’st me not by my clothes?

Thou precious varlet,

My tailor made them not.

Thou injurious thief,

Hear but my name, and tremble.

Cloten, thou villain.

To thy further fear,

Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know

I am son to th’ Queen.

Art not afeard?

Die the death!

When I have slain thee with my proper hand,

I’ll follow those that even now fled hence

And on the gates of Lud’s Town set your heads.

Yield, rustic mountaineer!
