violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice

Where air comes out air comes in There's

none abroad so wholesome as that you vent

Hurt him His body's a passable carcass if

he be not hurt It is a thoroughfare for steel if it be

not hurt

Stand you You have land enough of your

own but he added to your having gave you some

ground

Sir as I told you always her beauty and

her brain go not together She's a good sign but I

have seen small reflection of her wit

I'll attend your Lordship

What got he by that You have broke his

pate with your bowl

Did you hear of a stranger that's come to

court tonight

There's an Italian come and 'tis thought

one of Leonatus' friends

One of your Lordship's pages

Your Lordship is the most patient man in

loss the most coldest that ever turned up ace

But not every man patient after the noble

temper of your Lordship You are most hot and

furious when you win

Day my lord
