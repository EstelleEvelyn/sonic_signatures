Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him.

Glad am I that your Highness is so armed

To bear the tidings of calamity.

Like an unseasonable stormy day

Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores

As if the world were all dissolved to tears,

So high above his limits swells the rage

Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land

With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.

Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps

Against thy Majesty; boys with women’s voices

Strive to speak big and clap their female joints

In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;

Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows

Of double-fatal yew against thy state.

Yea, distaff women manage rusty bills

Against thy seat. Both young and old rebel,

And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

Sweet love, I see, changing his property,

Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.

Again uncurse their souls. Their peace is made

With heads and not with hands. Those whom you curse

Have felt the worst of death’s destroying wound

And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.

Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.

Men judge by the complexion of the sky

The state and inclination of the day;

So may you by my dull and heavy eye.

My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.

I play the torturer by small and small

To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken.

Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke,

And all your northern castles yielded up,

And all your southern gentlemen in arms

Upon his party.
