


Thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight

If after this command thou fraught the court

With thy unworthiness thou diest Away

Thou 'rt poison to my blood

O disloyal thing

That shouldst repair my youth thou heap'st

A year's age on me

Past grace Obedience

That mightst have had the sole son of my queen

Thou took'st a beggar wouldst have made my throne

A seat for baseness

O thou vile one

What art thou mad

Thou foolish thing

They were again together You have done

Not after our command Away with her

And pen her up

Nay let her languish

A drop of blood a day and being aged

Die of this folly

Attend you here the door of our stern daughter

Will she not forth

The exile of her minion is too new

She hath not yet forgot him Some more time

Must wear the print of his remembrance on 't

And then she's yours

A worthy fellow

Albeit he comes on angry purpose now

But that's no fault of his We must receive him

According to the honor of his sender

And towards himself his goodness forespent on us

We must extend our noticeOur dear son

When you have given good morning to your mistress

Attend the Queen and us We shall have need

T' employ you towards this RomanCome our queen

Now say what would Augustus Caesar with us

Son let your mother end

You must know

Till the injurious Romans did extort

This tribute from us we were free Caesar's ambition

Which swelled so much that it did almost stretch

The sides o' th' world against all color here

Did put the yoke upon 's which to shake off

Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon

Ourselves to be We do say then to Caesar

Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which

Ordained our laws whose use the sword of Caesar

Hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise

Shall by the power we hold be our good deed

Though Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our laws

Who was the first of Britain which did put

His brows within a golden crown and called

Himself a king

Thou art welcome Caius

Thy Caesar knighted me my youth I spent

Much under him Of him I gathered honor

Which he to seek of me again perforce

Behooves me keep at utterance I am perfect

That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for

Their liberties are now in arms a precedent

Which not to read would show the Britons cold

So Caesar shall not find them

I know your master's pleasure and he mine

All the remain is welcome

Thus far and so farewell

Our subjects sir

Will not endure his yoke and for ourself

To show less sovereignty than they must needs

Appear unkinglike

My lords you are appointed for that office

The due of honor in no point omit

So farewell noble Lucius

Leave not the worthy Lucius good my lords

Till he have crossed the Severn Happiness

Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor

How it goes here It fits us therefore ripely

Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness

The powers that he already hath in Gallia

Will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves

His war for Britain

Our expectation that it would be thus

Hath made us forward But my gentle queen

Where is our daughter She hath not appeared

Before the Roman nor to us hath tendered

The duty of the day She looks us like

A thing more made of malice than of duty

We have noted itCall her before us for

We have been too slight in sufferance

Where is she sir How

Can her contempt be answered

Her doors locked

Not seen of late Grant heavens that which I

Fear prove false

Again and bring me word how 'tis with her

A fever with the absence of her son

A madness of which her life's in danger Heavens

How deeply you at once do touch me Imogen

The great part of my comfort gone my queen

Upon a desperate bed and in a time

When fearful wars point at me her son gone

So needful for this present It strikes me past

The hope of comfortBut for thee fellow

Who needs must know of her departure and

Dost seem so ignorant we'll enforce it from thee

By a sharp torture

The time is troublesome

We'll slip you for a season but our jealousy

Does yet depend

Now for the counsel of my son and queen

I am amazed with matter

I thank you Let's withdraw

And meet the time as it seeks us We fear not

What can from Italy annoy us but

We grieve at chances here Away

Stand by my side you whom the gods have made

Preservers of my throne Woe is my heart

That the poor soldier that so richly fought

Whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast

Stepped before targes of proof cannot be found

He shall be happy that can find him if

Our grace can make him so

No tidings of him

 To my grief I am

The heir of his reward which I will add

To you the liver heart and brain of Britain

By whom I grant she lives 'Tis now the time

To ask of whence you are Report it

Bow your knees

Arise my knights o' th' battle I create you

Companions to our person and will fit you

With dignities becoming your estates

There's business in these faces Why so sadly

Greet you our victory You look like Romans

And not o' th' court of Britain

Who worse than a physician

Would this report become But I consider

By med'cine life may be prolonged yet death

Will seize the doctor too How ended she

Prithee say

She alone knew this

And but she spoke it dying I would not

Believe her lips in opening it Proceed

O most delicate fiend

Who is 't can read a woman Is there more

Heard you all this her women

Mine eyes

Were not in fault for she was beautiful

Mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart

That thought her like her seeming It had been vicious

To have mistrusted her Yet O my daughter

That it was folly in me thou mayst say

And prove it in thy feeling Heaven mend all

Thou com'st not Caius now for tribute That

The Britons have razed out though with the loss

Of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit

That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter

Of you their captives which ourself have granted

So think of your estate

I have surely seen him

His favor is familiar to meBoy

Thou hast looked thyself into my grace

And art mine own I know not why wherefore

To say Live boy Ne'er thank thy master Live

And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt

Fitting my bounty and thy state I'll give it

Yea though thou do demand a prisoner

The noblest ta'en

What would'st thou boy

I love thee more and more Think more and more

What's best to ask Know'st him thou look'st on Speak

Wilt have him live Is he thy kin Thy friend

Wherefore ey'st him so

Ay with all my heart

And lend my best attention What's thy name

Thou 'rt my good youth my page

I'll be thy master Walk with me Speak freely

Come stand thou by our side

Make thy demand aloud Sir step you forth

Give answer to this boy and do it freely

Or by our greatness and the grace of it

Which is our honor bitter torture shall

Winnow the truth from falsehoodOn Speak to him

That diamond upon your finger say How came it yours

How Me

All that belongs to this

My daughter What of her Renew thy strength

I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will

Than die ere I hear more Strive man and speak

I stand on fire

Come to the matter

Nay nay to th' purpose

Does the world go round

If this be so the gods do mean to strike me

To death with mortal joy

The tune of Imogen

New matter still

What's this Cornelius

How now my flesh my child

What mak'st thou me a dullard in this act

Wilt thou not speak to me

My tears that fall

Prove holy water on thee Imogen

Thy mother's dead

O she was naught and long of her it was

That we meet here so strangely But her son

Is gone we know not how nor where

Marry the gods forfend

I would not thy good deeds should from my lips

Pluck a hard sentence Prithee valiant youth

Deny 't again

He was a prince

I am sorrow for thee

By thine own tongue thou art condemned and must

Endure our law Thou 'rt dead

Bind the offender

And take him from our presence

Why old soldier

Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for

By tasting of our wrath How of descent

As good as we

And thou shalt die for 't

What of him He is

A banished traitor

Take him hence

The whole world shall not save him

Nursing of my sons

How My issue

Thou weep'st and speak'st

The service that you three have done is more

Unlike than this thou tell'st I lost my children

If these be they I know not how to wish

A pair of worthier sons

Guiderius had

Upon his neck a mole a sanguine star

It was a mark of wonder

O what am I

A mother to the birth of three Ne'er mother

Rejoiced deliverance moreBlest pray you be

That after this strange starting from your orbs

You may reign in them nowO Imogen

Thou hast lost by this a kingdom

Did you e'er meet

O rare instinct

When shall I hear all through This fierce abridgment

Hath to it circumstantial branches which

Distinction should be rich in Where how lived you

And when came you to serve our Roman captive

How parted with your brothers How first met them

Why fled you from the court And whither These

And your three motives to the battle with

I know not how much more should be demanded

And all the other by-dependences

From chance to chance but nor the time nor place

Will serve our long interrogatories See

Posthumus anchors upon Imogen

And she like harmless lightning throws her eye

On him her brothers me her master hitting

Each object with a joy the counterchange

Is severally in all Let's quit this ground

And smoke the temple with our sacrifices

Thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever

All o'erjoyed

Save these in bonds let them be joyful too

For they shall taste our comfort

The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought

He would have well becomed this place and graced

The thankings of a king

Nobly doomed

We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law

Pardon's the word to all

This hath some seeming

Well

My peace we will begin And Caius Lucius

Although the victor we submit to Caesar

And to the Roman Empire promising

To pay our wonted tribute from the which

We were dissuaded by our wicked queen

Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers

Have laid most heavy hand

Laud we the gods

And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils

From our blest altars Publish we this peace

To all our subjects Set we forward Let

A Roman and a British ensign wave

Friendly together So through Lud's Town march

And in the temple of great Jupiter

Our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts

Set on there Never was a war did cease

Ere bloody hands were washed with such a peace
