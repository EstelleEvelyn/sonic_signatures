straight The crowner hath sat on her and finds it

Christian burial

Why 'tis found so

Nay but hear you goodman delver

But is this law

Will you ha' the truth on 't If this had not been

a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o'

Christian burial

Why he had none

The gallows-maker for that frame outlives a

thousand tenants

Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright

or a carpenter

Marry now I can tell

Mass I cannot tell
