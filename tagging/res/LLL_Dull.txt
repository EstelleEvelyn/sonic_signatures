I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his

Sir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you

keep Costard safe, and you must suffer him to take

no delight, nor no penance, but he must fast three

days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the

park. She is allowed for the dey-woman. Fare you

the moon is never but a month old. And I say besides

that, ’twas a pricket that the Princess killed.

If a talent be a claw, look how he claws

him with a talent.

Nor understood none neither, sir.

I’ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play on

the tabor to the Worthies and let them dance the

hay.
