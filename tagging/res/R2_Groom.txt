I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,

When thou wert king; who, traveling towards York,

With much ado at length have gotten leave

To look upon my sometime royal master’s face.

O, how it earned my heart when I beheld

In London streets, that coronation day,

When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,

That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,

That horse that I so carefully have dressed.

So proudly as if he disdained the ground.

What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
