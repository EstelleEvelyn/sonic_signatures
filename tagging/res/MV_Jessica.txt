


I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so

Our house is hell and thou a merry devil

Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness

But fare thee well There is a ducat for thee

And Lancelet soon at supper shalt thou see

Lorenzo who is thy new master's guest

Give him this letter do it secretly

And so farewell I would not have my father

See me in talk with thee

Farewell good Lancelet

Alack what heinous sin is it in me

To be ashamed to be my father's child

But though I am a daughter to his blood

I am not to his manners O Lorenzo

If thou keep promise I shall end this strife

Become a Christian and thy loving wife

Call you What is your will

His words were Farewell mistress nothing else

Farewell and if my fortune be not crossed

I have a father you a daughter lost

Who are you Tell me for more certainty

Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue

Lorenzo certain and my love indeed

For who love I so much And now who knows

But you Lorenzo whether I am yours

Here catch this casket it is worth the pains

I am glad 'tis night you do not look on me

For I am much ashamed of my exchange

But love is blind and lovers cannot see

The pretty follies that themselves commit

For if they could Cupid himself would blush

To see me thus transformd to a boy

What must I hold a candle to my shames

They in themselves good sooth are too too light

Why 'tis an office of discovery love

And I should be obscured

I will make fast the doors and gild myself

With some more ducats and be with you straight

When I was with him I have heard him swear

To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen

That he would rather have Antonio's flesh

Than twenty times the value of the sum

That he did owe him And I know my lord

If law authority and power deny not

It will go hard with poor Antonio

I wish your Ladyship all heart's content

And what hope is that I pray thee

That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so

the sins of my mother should be visited upon me

I shall be saved by my husband He hath made

me a Christian

I'll tell my husband Lancelet what you say

Here he comes

Nay you need not fear us Lorenzo Lancelet

and I are out He tells me flatly there's no mercy for

me in heaven because I am a Jew's daughter and

he says you are no good member of the commonwealth

for in converting Jews to Christians you

raise the price of pork

Past all expressing It is very meet

The Lord Bassanio live an upright life

For having such a blessing in his lady

He finds the joys of heaven here on Earth

And if on Earth he do not merit it

In reason he should never come to heaven

Why if two gods should play some heavenly match

And on the wager lay two earthly women

And Portia one there must be something else

Pawned with the other for the poor rude world

Hath not her fellow

Nay but ask my opinion too of that

Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach

Well I'll set you forth

In such a night

Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew

And saw the lion's shadow ere himself

And ran dismayed away

In such a night

Medea gathered the enchanted herbs

That did renew old Aeson

In such a night

Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well

Stealing her soul with many vows of faith

And ne'er a true one

I would out-night you did nobody come

But hark I hear the footing of a man

I am never merry when I hear sweet music
