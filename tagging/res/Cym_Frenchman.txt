many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes

as he

And then his banishment

Sir we have known together

in Orleans

Sir you o'errate my poor kindness I was

glad I did atone my countryman and you It had

been pity you should have been put together with

so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance

of so slight and trivial a nature

Faith yes to be put to the arbitrament of

swords and by such two that would by all likelihood

have confounded one the other or have fall'n

both

Safely I think 'Twas a contention in public

which may without contradiction suffer the report

It was much like an argument that fell out

last night where each of us fell in praise of our

country mistresses this gentleman at that time

vouchingand upon warrant of bloody affirmation

his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste

constant qualified and less attemptable than any

the rarest of our ladies in France

Will this hold think you
