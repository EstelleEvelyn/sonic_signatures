That Martius shall be consul. I have seen

The dumb men throng to see him, and the blind

To hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,

Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs,

Upon him as he passed; the nobles bended

As to Jove’s statue, and the Commons made

A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.

I never saw the like.
