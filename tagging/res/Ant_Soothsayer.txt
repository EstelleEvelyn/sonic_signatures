In nature’s infinite book of secrecy

A little I can read.

I make not, but foresee.

You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

You shall be more beloving than beloved.

You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune

Than that which is to approach.

If every of your wishes had a womb,

And fertile every wish, a million.

Your fortunes are alike.

I have said.

Would I had never come from thence,

nor you thither.

I see it in my motion, have it not in my

tongue. But yet hie you to Egypt again.

Caesar’s.

Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.

Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is

Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,

Where Caesar’s is not. But near him, thy angel

Becomes afeard, as being o’erpowered. Therefore

Make space enough between you.

To none but thee; no more but when to thee.

If thou dost play with him at any game,

Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck

He beats thee ’gainst the odds. Thy luster thickens

When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit

Is all afraid to govern thee near him;

But he away, ’tis noble.
