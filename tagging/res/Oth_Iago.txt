


’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!

If ever I did dream of such a matter,

Abhor me.

Despise me

If I do not. Three great ones of the city,

In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,

Off-capped to him; and, by the faith of man,

I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.

But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,

Evades them with a bombast circumstance,

Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,

And in conclusion,

Nonsuits my mediators. For “Certes,” says he,

“I have already chose my officer.”

And what was he?

Forsooth, a great arithmetician,

One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,

A fellow almost damned in a fair wife,

That never set a squadron in the field,

Nor the division of a battle knows

More than a spinster—unless the bookish theoric,

Wherein the togèd consuls can propose

As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice

Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’ election;

And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof

At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds

Christened and heathen, must be beleed and calmed

By debitor and creditor. This countercaster,

He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,

And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.

Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service.

Preferment goes by letter and affection,

And not by old gradation, where each second

Stood heir to th’ first. Now, sir, be judge yourself

Whether I in any just term am affined

To love the Moor.

O, sir, content you.

I follow him to serve my turn upon him.

We cannot all be masters, nor all masters

Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark

Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave

That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,

Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,

For naught but provender, and when he’s old, cashiered.

Whip me such honest knaves! Others there are

Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,

Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,

And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,

Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats,

Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,

And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,

It is as sure as you are Roderigo,

Were I the Moor I would not be Iago.

In following him, I follow but myself.

Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,

But seeming so for my peculiar end.

For when my outward action doth demonstrate

The native act and figure of my heart

In complement extern, ’tis not long after

But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve

For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.

Call up her father.

Rouse him. Make after him, poison his delight,

Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,

And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,

Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,

Yet throw such chances of vexation on ’t

As it may lose some color.

Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell

As when, by night and negligence, the fire

Is spied in populous cities.

Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!

Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!

Thieves, thieves!

Are your doors locked?

Zounds, sir, you’re robbed. For shame, put on your gown!

Your heart is burst. You have lost half your soul.

Even now, now, very now, an old black ram

Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!

Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,

Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.

Arise, I say!

Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not

serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to

do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll

have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse,

you’ll have your nephews neigh to you, you’ll have

coursers for cousins and jennets for germans.

I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter

and the Moor are now making the beast with

two backs.

You are a senator.

Farewell, for I must leave you.

It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place

To be producted, as if I stay I shall,

Against the Moor. For I do know the state,

However this may gall him with some check,

Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embarked

With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,

Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,

Another of his fathom they have none

To lead their business. In which regard,

Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,

Yet, for necessity of present life,

I must show out a flag and sign of love—

Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,

Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search,

And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

Though in the trade of war I have slain men,

Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ th’ conscience

To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity

Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times

I had thought t’ have yerked him here under the ribs.

Nay, but he prated

And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms

Against your Honor,

That with the little godliness I have

I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,

Are you fast married? Be assured of this,

That the magnifico is much beloved,

And hath in his effect a voice potential

As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you

Or put upon you what restraint or grievance

The law (with all his might to enforce it on)

Will give him cable.

Those are the raisèd father and his friends.

You were best go in.

By Janus, I think no.

Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.

If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.

He’s married.

Marry, to—    Come, captain, will you go?

It is Brabantio. General, be advised,

He comes to bad intent.

You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.

What sayst thou, noble heart?

Why, go to bed and sleep.

If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,

thou silly gentleman!

O, villainous! I have looked upon the world for

four times seven years, and since I could distinguish

betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found

man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say

I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I

would change my humanity with a baboon.

Virtue? A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or

thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our

wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles

or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,

supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it

with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or

manured with industry, why the power and corrigible

authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance

of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise

another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our

natures would conduct us to most prepost’rous

conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging

motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts—

whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect, or

scion.

It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission

of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown

cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy

friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving

with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never

better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse.

Follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an

usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It

cannot be that Desdemona should long continue

her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse—

nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in

her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration

—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are

changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money.

The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts

shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.

She must change for youth. When she is sated

with his body she will find the error of her choice.

Therefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt

needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than

drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony

and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian

and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my

wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.

Therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself!

It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be

hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned

and go without her.

Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have

told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I

hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no

less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge

against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost

thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many

events in the womb of time which will be delivered.

Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more

of this tomorrow. Adieu.

At my lodging.

Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?

No more of drowning, do you hear?

Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your

purse.

Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

For I mine own gained knowledge should profane

If I would time expend with such a snipe

But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,

And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets

’Has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,

But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,

Will do as if for surety. He holds me well.

The better shall my purpose work on him.

Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now:

To get his place and to plume up my will

In double knavery—How? how?—Let’s see.

After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear

That he is too familiar with his wife.

He hath a person and a smooth dispose

To be suspected, framed to make women false.

The Moor is of a free and open nature

That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,

And will as tenderly be led by th’ nose

As asses are.

I have ’t. It is engendered. Hell and night

Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.

Sir, would she give you so much of her lips

As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,

You would have enough.

In faith, too much.

I find it still when I have list to sleep.

Marry, before your Ladyship, I grant,

She puts her tongue a little in her heart

And chides with thinking.

Come on, come on! You are pictures out of door,

bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,

saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players

in your huswifery, and huswives in your beds.

Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.

You rise to play, and go to bed to work.

No, let me not.

O, gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,

For I am nothing if not critical.

Ay, madam.

I am about it, but indeed my invention comes

from my pate as birdlime does from frieze: it

plucks out brains and all. But my muse labors, and

thus she is delivered:

If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,

The one’s for use, the other useth it.

If she be black, and thereto have a wit,

She’ll find a white that shall her blackness hit.

She never yet was foolish that was fair,

For even her folly helped her to an heir.

There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,

But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

She that was ever fair and never proud,

Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,

Never lacked gold and yet went never gay,

Fled from her wish, and yet said “Now I may,”

She that being angered, her revenge being nigh,

Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,

She that in wisdom never was so frail

To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail,

She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,

See suitors following and not look behind,

She was a wight, if ever such wight were—

To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said,

whisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as

great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do. I will

gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, ’tis

so indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of

your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not

kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again

you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well

kissed; an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet

again your fingers to your lips? Would they were

clyster pipes for your sake!

The Moor. I know his trumpet.

O, you are well tuned now,

But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music,

As honest as I am.

Do thou meet me presently

at the harbor. Come hither. If

thou be’st valiant—as they say base men being in

love have then a nobility in their natures more than

is native to them—list me. The Lieutenant tonight

watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee

this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.

Mark me with what violence she first loved the

Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical

lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not

thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And

what delight shall she have to look on the devil?

When the blood is made dull with the act of sport,

there should be, again to inflame it and to give

satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy

in years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor

is defective in. Now, for want of these required

conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself

abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and

abhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it

and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir,

this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced

position—who stands so eminent in the degree of

this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no

further conscionable than in putting on the mere

form of civil and humane seeming for the better

compassing of his salt and most hidden loose

affection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and

subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an

eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though

true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave!

Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all

those requisites in him that folly and green minds

look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the

woman hath found him already.

Blessed fig’s end! The wine she drinks is made of

grapes. If she had been blessed, she would never

have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou

not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst

not mark that?

Lechery, by this hand! An index and obscure

prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.

They met so near with their lips that their breaths

embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!

When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard

at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’

incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled

by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you

tonight. For the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you.

Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do

you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by

speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from

what other course you please, which the time shall

more favorably minister.

Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and

haply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may,

for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to

mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no

true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So

shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by

the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the

impediment most profitably removed, without the

which there were no expectation of our prosperity.

I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I

must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t.

That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit.

The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,

Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,

And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona

A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,

Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure

I stand accountant for as great a sin)

But partly led to diet my revenge

For that I do suspect the lusty Moor

Hath leaped into my seat—the thought whereof

Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,

And nothing can or shall content my soul

Till I am evened with him, wife for wife,

Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor

At least into a jealousy so strong

That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,

If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace

For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,

I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,

Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb

(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),

Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me

For making him egregiously an ass

And practicing upon his peace and quiet

Even to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confused.

Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used.

Not this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’

clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of

his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame;

he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and

she is sport for Jove.

And, I’ll warrant her, full of game.

What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley

to provocation.

And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,

I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a

brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a

measure to the health of black Othello.

O, they are our friends! But one cup; I’ll drink

for you.

What, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants

desire it.

Here at the door. I pray you, call them in.

If I can fasten but one cup upon him

With that which he hath drunk tonight already,

He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense

As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,

Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,

To Desdemona hath tonight caroused

Potations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch.

Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits

That hold their honors in a wary distance,

The very elements of this warlike isle,

Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups;

And they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards

Am I to put our Cassio in some action

That may offend the isle. But here they come.

If consequence do but approve my dream,

My boat sails freely both with wind and stream.

Some wine, ho!

And let me the cannikin clink, clink,

And let me the cannikin clink.

A soldier’s a man,

O, man’s life’s but a span,

Why, then, let a soldier drink.

Some wine, boys!

I learned it in England, where indeed they are

most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,

and your swag-bellied Hollander—drink, ho!—are

nothing to your English.

Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane

dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.

He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next

pottle can be filled.

O sweet England!

King Stephen was and-a worthy peer,

His breeches cost him but a crown;

He held them sixpence all too dear;

With that he called the tailor lown.

He was a wight of high renown,

And thou art but of low degree;

’Tis pride that pulls the country down,

Then take thy auld cloak about thee.

Some wine, ho!

Will you hear ’t again?

It’s true, good lieutenant.

And so do I too, lieutenant.

You see this fellow that is gone before?

He’s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar

And give direction; and do but see his vice.

’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,

The one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him.

I fear the trust Othello puts him in,

On some odd time of his infirmity,

Will shake this island.

’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.

He’ll watch the horologe a double set

If drink rock not his cradle.

How now, Roderigo?

I pray you, after the Lieutenant, go.

Not I, for this fair island.

I do love Cassio well and would do much

To cure him of this evil— But hark! What noise?

Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.

Nay, good lieutenant.—God’s will, gentlemen!—

Help, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano—sir—

Help, masters!—Here’s a goodly watch indeed!

Who’s that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho!

The town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold!

You will be shamed forever.

Hold, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano— gentlemen—

Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?

Hold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!

I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,

In quarter and in terms like bride and groom

Divesting them for bed; and then but now,

As if some planet had unwitted men,

Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,

In opposition bloody. I cannot speak

Any beginning to this peevish odds,

And would in action glorious I had lost

Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

Touch me not so near.

I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth

Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio.

Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth

Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:

Montano and myself being in speech,

There comes a fellow crying out for help,

And Cassio following him with determined sword

To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman

Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.

Myself the crying fellow did pursue,

Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out—

The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,

Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather

For that I heard the clink and fall of swords

And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight

I ne’er might say before. When I came back—

For this was brief—I found them close together

At blow and thrust, even as again they were

When you yourself did part them.

More of this matter cannot I report.

But men are men; the best sometimes forget.

Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,

As men in rage strike those that wish them best,

Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received

From him that fled some strange indignity

Which patience could not pass.

What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

Marry, God forbid!

As I am an honest man, I thought you had

received some bodily wound. There is more sense

in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and

most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost

without deserving. You have lost no reputation at

all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,

man, there are ways to recover the General again!

You are but now cast in his mood—a punishment

more in policy than in malice, even so as one would

beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious

lion. Sue to him again and he’s yours.

What was he that you followed with your sword?

What had he done to you?

Is ’t possible?

Why, but you are now well enough. How came

you thus recovered?

Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time,

the place, and the condition of this country stands,

I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But

since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,

if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it.

And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

You or any man living may be drunk at a time,

man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s

wife is now the general: I may say so in this

respect, for that he hath devoted and given up

himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement

of her parts and graces. Confess yourself

freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your

place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so

blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her

goodness not to do more than she is requested. This

broken joint between you and her husband entreat

her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay

worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow

stronger than it was before.

I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest

kindness.

You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I

must to the watch.

And what’s he, then, that says I play the villain,

When this advice is free I give and honest,

Probal to thinking, and indeed the course

To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy

Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue

In any honest suit. She’s framed as fruitful

As the free elements. And then for her

To win the Moor—were ’t to renounce his baptism,

All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin—

His soul is so enfettered to her love

That she may make, unmake, do what she list,

Even as her appetite shall play the god

With his weak function. How am I then a villain

To counsel Cassio to this parallel course

Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!

When devils will the blackest sins put on,

They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,

As I do now. For whiles this honest fool

Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,

And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,

I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear:

That she repeals him for her body’s lust;

And by how much she strives to do him good,

She shall undo her credit with the Moor.

So will I turn her virtue into pitch,

And out of her own goodness make the net

That shall enmesh them all.    How now, Roderigo?

How poor are they that have not patience!

What wound did ever heal but by degrees?

Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,

And wit depends on dilatory time.

Does ’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,

And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.

Though other things grow fair against the sun,

Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.

Content thyself awhile. By th’ Mass, ’tis morning!

Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.

Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.

Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.

Nay, get thee gone. Two things are to be done.

My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.

I’ll set her on.

Myself the while to draw the Moor apart

And bring him jump when he may Cassio find

Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.

Dull not device by coldness and delay.

You have not been abed, then?

I’ll send her to you presently,

And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor

Out of the way, that your converse and business

May be more free.

Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.

Ha, I like not that.

Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.

Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it

That he would steal away so guiltylike,

Seeing your coming.

My noble lord—

Did Michael Cassio,

When you wooed my lady, know of your love?

But for a satisfaction of my thought,

No further harm.

I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

Indeed?

Honest, my lord?

My lord, for aught I know.

Think, my lord?

My lord, you know I love you.

For Michael Cassio,

I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

Men should be what they seem;

Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.

Good my lord, pardon me.

Though I am bound to every act of duty,

I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.

Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false—

As where’s that palace whereinto foul things

Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure

But some uncleanly apprehensions

Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit

With meditations lawful?

I do beseech you,

Though I perchance am vicious in my guess—

As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague

To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy

Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom

From one that so imperfectly conceits

Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble

Out of his scattering and unsure observance.

It were not for your quiet nor your good,

Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,

To let you know my thoughts.

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,

Is the immediate jewel of their souls.

Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing;

’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.

But he that filches from me my good name

Robs me of that which not enriches him

And makes me poor indeed.

You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,

Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.

O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!

It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock

The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss

Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;

But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er

Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!

Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;

But riches fineless is as poor as winter

To him that ever fears he shall be poor.

Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend

From jealousy!

I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason

To show the love and duty that I bear you

With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,

Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.

Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;

Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.

I would not have your free and noble nature,

Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.

I know our country disposition well.

In Venice they do let God see the pranks

They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience

Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.

She did deceive her father, marrying you,

And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,

She loved them most.

Why, go to, then!

She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,

To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,

He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to blame.

I humbly do beseech you of your pardon

For too much loving you.

I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.

I’ faith, I fear it has.

I hope you will consider what is spoke

Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved.

I am to pray you not to strain my speech

To grosser issues nor to larger reach

Than to suspicion.

Should you do so, my lord,

My speech should fall into such vile success

As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend.

My lord, I see you’re moved.

Long live she so! And long live you to think so!

Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,

Not to affect many proposèd matches

Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,

Whereto we see in all things nature tends—

Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,

Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural—

But pardon me—I do not in position

Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear

Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,

May fall to match you with her country forms

And happily repent.

My lord, I take my leave.

My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor

To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.

Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place—

For sure he fills it up with great ability—

Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,

You shall by that perceive him and his means.

Note if your lady strain his entertainment

With any strong or vehement importunity.

Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,

Let me be thought too busy in my fears—

As worthy cause I have to fear I am—

And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.

I once more take my leave.

How now? What do you here alone?

You have a thing for me? It is a common thing—

To have a foolish wife.

What handkerchief?

Hast stol’n it from her?

A good wench! Give it me.

Why, what is that to you?

Be not acknown on ’t.

I have use for it. Go, leave me.

I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin

And let him find it. Trifles light as air

Are to the jealous confirmations strong

As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.

The Moor already changes with my poison;

Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,

Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,

But with a little act upon the blood

Burn like the mines of sulfur.    I did say so.

Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora

Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world

Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep

Which thou owedst yesterday.

Why, how now, general? No more of that!

How now, my lord?

I am sorry to hear this.

Is ’t possible, my lord?

Is ’t come to this?

My noble lord—

O grace! O heaven forgive me!

Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?

God b’ wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool,

That liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!—

O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:

To be direct and honest is not safe.—

I thank you for this profit, and from hence

I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.

I should be wise; for honesty’s a fool

And loses that it works for.

I see you are eaten up with passion.

I do repent me that I put it to you.

You would be satisfied?

And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?

Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,

Behold her topped?

It were a tedious difficulty, I think,

To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then

If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster

More than their own! What then? How then?

What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?

It is impossible you should see this,

Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,

As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross

As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,

If imputation and strong circumstances

Which lead directly to the door of truth

Will give you satisfaction, you might have ’t.

I do not like the office,

But sith I am entered in this cause so far,

Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love,

I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,

And being troubled with a raging tooth

I could not sleep. There are a kind of men

So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter

Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.

In sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona,

Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.”

And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,

Cry “O sweet creature!” then kiss me hard,

As if he plucked up kisses by the roots

That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg

O’er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then

Cried “Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!”

Nay, this was but his dream.

And this may help to thicken other proofs

That do demonstrate thinly.

Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done.

She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:

Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief

Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?

I know not that; but such a handkerchief—

I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today

See Cassio wipe his beard with.

If it be that, or any that was hers,

It speaks against her with the other proofs.

Yet be content.

Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.

Do not rise yet.

Witness, you ever-burning lights above,

You elements that clip us round about,

Witness that here Iago doth give up

The execution of his wit, hands, heart

To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,

And to obey shall be in me remorse,

What bloody business ever.

My friend is dead.

’Tis done at your request. But let her live.

I am your own forever.

There is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,

And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.

Is my lord angry?

Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon

When it hath blown his ranks into the air

And, like the devil, from his very arm

Puffed his own brother—and is he angry?

Something of moment then. I will go meet him.

There’s matter in ’t indeed if he be angry.

Will you think so?

What,

To kiss in private?

Or to be naked with her friend in bed

An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

If they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.

But if I give my wife a handkerchief—

Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,

She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.

Her honor is an essence that’s not seen;

They have it very oft that have it not.

But for the handkerchief—

Ay, what of that?

What

If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?

Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,

Who having, by their own importunate suit

Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,

Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose

But they must blab)—

He hath, my lord, but be you well assured,

No more than he’ll unswear.

Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.

Lie—

With her—on her—what you will.

Work on,

My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,

And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,

All guiltless, meet reproach.—What ho! My lord!

My lord, I say. Othello!    How now, Cassio?

My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy.

This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.

No, forbear.

The lethargy must have his quiet course.

If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by

Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.

Do you withdraw yourself a little while.

He will recover straight. When he is gone,

I would on great occasion speak with you.

How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?

I mock you not, by heaven!

Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,

And many a civil monster.

Good sir, be a man!

Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked

May draw with you. There’s millions now alive

That nightly lie in those unproper beds

Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.

O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,

To lip a wanton in a secure couch

And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,

And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

Stand you awhile apart.

Confine yourself but in a patient list.

Whilst you were here, o’erwhelmèd with your grief—

A passion most unsuiting such a man—

Cassio came hither. I shifted him away

And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,

Bade him anon return and here speak with me,

The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,

And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns

That dwell in every region of his face.

For I will make him tell the tale anew—

Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when

He hath and is again to cope your wife.

I say but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,

Or I shall say you’re all in all in spleen,

And nothing of a man.

That’s not amiss.

But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?

Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,

A huswife that by selling her desires

Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature

That dotes on Cassio—as ’tis the strumpet’s plague

To beguile many and be beguiled by one.

He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain

From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.

As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,

And his unbookish jealousy must construe

Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors

Quite in the wrong.—How do you, lieutenant?

Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.

Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,

How quickly should you speed!

I never knew woman love man so.

Do you hear, Cassio?

She gives it out that you shall marry her.

Do you intend it?

Faith, the cry goes that you marry her.

I am a very villain else.

Before me, look where she comes.

After her, after her!

Will you sup there?

Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very

fain speak with you.

Go to; say no more.

Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

And did you see the handkerchief?

Yours, by this hand! And to see how he prizes

the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and

he hath giv’n it his whore.

Nay, you must forget that.

Nay, that’s not your way.

She’s the worse for all this.

Ay, too gentle.

If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her

patent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes

near nobody.

O, ’tis foul in her.

That’s fouler.

Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,

even the bed she hath contaminated.

And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You

shall hear more by midnight.

I warrant something from Venice.

’Tis Lodovico. This comes from the Duke.

See, your wife’s with him.

I am very glad to see you, signior.

Welcome to Cyprus.

Lives, sir.

He is much changed.

He’s that he is. I may not breathe my censure

What he might be. If what he might he is not,

I would to heaven he were.

’Faith, that was not so well. Yet would I knew

That stroke would prove the worst.

Alas, alas!

It is not honesty in me to speak

What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,

And his own courses will denote him so

That I may save my speech. Do but go after

And mark how he continues.

What is your pleasure, madam? How is ’t with you?

What is the matter, lady?

What name, fair lady?

Why did he so?

Do not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!

Beshrew him for ’t! How comes this trick upon him?

Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.

Speak within door.

You are a fool. Go to!

I pray you be content. ’Tis but his humor.

The business of the state does him offense,

And he does chide with you.

It is but so, I warrant.

Hark how these instruments summon to supper.

The messengers of Venice stays the meat.

Go in and weep not. All things shall be well.

How now, Roderigo?

What in the contrary?

Will you hear me, Roderigo?

You charge me most unjustly.

Well, go to! Very well.

Very well.

You have said now.

Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even

from this instant do build on thee a better opinion

than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.

Thou hast taken against me a most just exception,

but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy

affair.

I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your

suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,

Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I

have greater reason to believe now than ever—I

mean purpose, courage, and valor—this night show

it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,

take me from this world with treachery and

devise engines for my life.

Sir, there is especial commission come from

Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.

O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away

with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be

lingered here by some accident—wherein none

can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s

place: knocking out his brains.

Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He

sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to

him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If

you will watch his going thence (which I will

fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may

take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second

your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come,

stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will

show you such a necessity in his death that you shall

think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high

supper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!

And you shall be satisfied.

Here, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he come.

Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.

Quick, quick! Fear nothing. I’ll be at thy elbow.

It makes us or it mars us—think on that,

And fix most firm thy resolution.

Here, at thy hand. Be bold and take thy stand.

I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense,

And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,

Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,

Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,

He calls me to a restitution large

Of gold and jewels that I bobbed from him

As gifts to Desdemona.

It must not be. If Cassio do remain,

He hath a daily beauty in his life

That makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor

May unfold me to him. There stand I in much peril.

No, he must die. Be ’t so. I hear him coming.

Who’s there? Whose noise is this that cries on murder?

Did not you hear a cry?

What’s the matter?

What are you here that cry so grievously?

O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?

O treacherous villains!

What are you there?

Come in, and give some help.

O murd’rous slave! O villain!

Kill men i’ th’ dark?—Where be these bloody thieves?

How silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder!—

What may you be? Are you of good or evil?

Signior Lodovico?

I cry you mercy. Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.

How is ’t, brother?

Marry, heaven forbid!

Light, gentlemen. I’ll bind it with my shirt.

Who is ’t that cried?

O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect

Who they should be that have thus mangled you?

Lend me a garter. So.—O for a chair

To bear him easily hence!

Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash

To be a party in this injury.—

Patience awhile, good Cassio.—Come, come;

Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?

Alas, my friend and my dear countryman

Roderigo? No! Yes, sure. O heaven, Roderigo!

Even he, sir. Did you know him?

Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon.

These bloody accidents must excuse my manners

That so neglected you.

How do you, Cassio?—O, a chair, a chair!

He, he, ’tis he! O, that’s well said; the chair.—

Some good man bear him carefully from hence.

I’ll fetch the General’s surgeon.— For you, mistress,

Save you your labor.—He that lies slain here, Cassio,

Was my dear friend. What malice was between you?

What, look you pale?—O, bear him out o’ th’ air.

Stay you, good gentlemen.—Look you pale, mistress?—

Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?—

Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.—

Behold her well. I pray you, look upon her.

Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak

Though tongues were out of use.

Cassio hath here been set on in the dark

By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped.

He’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

This is the fruits of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,

Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight.

What, do you shake at that?

O, did he so? I charge you go with me.

Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dressed.—

Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.—

Emilia, run you to the citadel

And tell my lord and lady what hath happed.—

Will you go on afore? This is the night

That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

I told him what I thought, and told no more

Than what he found himself was apt and true.

I did.

With Cassio, mistress. Go to! Charm your tongue.

What, are you mad? I charge you get you home.

Zounds, hold your peace!

Be wise, and get you home.

Villainous whore!

Filth, thou liest!

I bleed, sir, but not killed.

Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.

From this time forth I never will speak word.
