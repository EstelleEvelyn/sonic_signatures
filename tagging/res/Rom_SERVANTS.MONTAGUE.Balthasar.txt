Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument,

And her immortal part with angels lives.

I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault

And presently took post to tell it you.

O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,

Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

I do beseech you, sir, have patience.

Your looks are pale and wild and do import

Some misadventure.

No, my good lord.

I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.

His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,

One that you love.

Romeo.

Full half an hour.

I dare not, sir.

My master knows not but I am gone hence,

And fearfully did menace me with death

If I did stay to look on his intents.

As I did sleep under this yew tree here,

I dreamt my master and another fought,

And that my master slew him.

I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,

And then in post he came from Mantua

To this same place, to this same monument.

This letter he early bid me give his father

And threatened me with death, going in the vault,

If I departed not and left him there.
