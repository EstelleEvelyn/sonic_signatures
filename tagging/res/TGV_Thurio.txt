


Seem you that you are not

So do counterfeits

What seem I that I am not

What instance of the contrary

And how quote you my folly

My jerkin is a doublet

How

That hath more mind to feed on your blood

than live in your air

Ay sir and done too for this time

Sir if you spend word for word with me I shall

make your wit bankrupt

They say that Love hath not an eye at all

Since his exile she hath despised me most

Forsworn my company and railed at me

That I am desperate of obtaining her

Therefore as you unwind her love from him

Lest it should ravel and be good to none

You must provide to bottom it on me

Which must be done by praising me as much

As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine

And thy advice this night I'll put in practice

Therefore sweet Proteus my direction-giver

Let us into the city presently

To sort some gentlemen well-skilled in music

I have a sonnet that will serve the turn

To give the onset to thy good advice

How now Sir Proteus are you crept before us

Ay but I hope sir that you love not here

Who Sylvia

I thank you for your ownNow gentlemen

Let's tune and to it lustily awhile

Where meet we

Farewell

Sir Proteus what says Sylvia to my suit

What That my leg is too long

I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder

What says she to my face

Nay then the wanton lies my face is black

How likes she my discourse

But well when I discourse of love and peace

What says she to my valor

What says she to my birth

Considers she my possessions

Wherefore

Not I

Why this it is to be a peevish girl

That flies her fortune when it follows her

I'll after more to be revenged on Eglamour

Than for the love of reckless Sylvia

Yonder is Sylvia and Sylvia's mine

Sir Valentine I care not for her I

I hold him but a fool that will endanger

His body for a girl that loves him not

I claim her not and therefore she is thine
