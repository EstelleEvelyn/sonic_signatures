


These your unusual weeds to each part of you

Does give a lifeno shepherdess but Flora

Peering in April's front This your sheep-shearing

Is as a meeting of the petty gods

And you the queen on 't

I bless the time

When my good falcon made her flight across

Thy father's ground

Apprehend

Nothing but jollity The gods themselves

Humbling their deities to love have taken

The shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter

Became a bull and bellowed the green Neptune

A ram and bleated and the fire-robed god

Golden Apollo a poor humble swain

As I seem now Their transformations

Were never for a piece of beauty rarer

Nor in a way so chaste since my desires

Run not before mine honor nor my lusts

Burn hotter than my faith

Thou dear'st Perdita

With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not

The mirth o' th' feast Or I'll be thine my fair

Or not my father's For I cannot be

Mine own nor anything to any if

I be not thine To this I am most constant

Though destiny say no Be merry gentle

Strangle such thoughts as these with anything

That you behold the while Your guests are coming

Lift up your countenance as it were the day

Of celebration of that nuptial which

We two have sworn shall come

See your guests approach

Address yourself to entertain them sprightly

And let's be red with mirth

What like a corse

What you do

Still betters what is done When you speak sweet

I'd have you do it ever When you sing

I'd have you buy and sell so so give alms

Pray so and for the ord'ring your affairs

To sing them too When you do dance I wish you

A wave o' th' sea that you might ever do

Nothing but that move still still so

And own no other function Each your doing

So singular in each particular

Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds

That all your acts are queens

I think you have

As little skill to fear as I have purpose

To put you to 't But come our dance I pray

Your hand my Perdita So turtles pair

That never mean to part

Old sir I know

She prizes not such trifles as these are

The gifts she looks from me are packed and locked

Up in my heart which I have given already

But not delivered O hear me breathe my life

Before this ancient sir who it should seem

Hath sometime loved I take thy hand this hand

As soft as dove's down and as white as it

Or Ethiopian's tooth or the fanned snow that's bolted

By th' northern blasts twice o'er

Do and be witness to 't

And he and more

Than he and menthe Earth the heavens and all

That were I crowned the most imperial monarch

Thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth

That ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge

More than was ever man's I would not prize them

Without her love for her employ them all

Commend them and condemn them to her service

Or to their own perdition

O that must be

I' th' virtue of your daughter One being dead

I shall have more than you can dream of yet

Enough then for your wonder But come on

Contract us fore these witnesses

I have but what of him

He neither does nor shall

No good sir

He has his health and ampler strength indeed

Than most have of his age

I yield all this

But for some other reasons my grave sir

Which 'tis not fit you know I not acquaint

My father of this business

He shall not

No he must not

Come come he must not

Mark our contract

Why look you so upon me

I am but sorry not afeard delayed

But nothing altered What I was I am

More straining on for plucking back not following

My leash unwillingly

I not purpose it

I think Camillo

It cannot fail but by

The violation of my faith and then

Let nature crush the sides o' th' Earth together

And mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks

From my succession wipe me father I

Am heir to my affection

I am and by my fancy If my reason

Will thereto be obedient I have reason

If not my senses better pleased with madness

Do bid it welcome

So call it but it does fulfill my vow

I needs must think it honesty Camillo

Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may

Be thereat gleaned for all the sun sees or

The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides

In unknown fathoms will I break my oath

To this my fair beloved Therefore I pray you

As you have ever been my father's honored friend

When he shall miss me as in faith I mean not

To see him anymore cast your good counsels

Upon his passion Let myself and fortune

Tug for the time to come This you may know

And so deliver I am put to sea

With her who here I cannot hold on shore

And most opportune to our need I have

A vessel rides fast by but not prepared

For this design What course I mean to hold

Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor

Concern me the reporting

Hark Perdita

I'll hear you by and by

Now good Camillo

I am so fraught with curious business that

I leave out ceremony

Very nobly

Have you deserved It is my father's music

To speak your deeds not little of his care

To have them recompensed as thought on

How Camillo

May this almost a miracle be done

That I may call thee something more than man

And after that trust to thee

Not any yet

But as th' unthought-on accident is guilty

To what we wildly do so we profess

Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies

Of every wind that blows

Worthy Camillo

What color for my visitation shall I

Hold up before him

I am bound to you

There is some sap in this

My good Camillo

She's as forward of her breeding as she is

I' th' rear our birth

My prettiest Perdita

But O the thorns we stand uponCamillo

Preserver of my father now of me

The medicine of our house how shall we do

We are not furnished like Bohemia's son

Nor shall appear in Sicilia

And those that you'll procure from King Leontes

Dispatch I prithee

Should I now meet my father

He would not call me son

O Perdita what have we twain forgot

Pray you a word

Fortune speed us

Thus we set on Camillo to th' seaside

By his command

Have I here touched Sicilia and from him

Give you all greetings that a king at friend

Can send his brother And but infirmity

Which waits upon worn times hath something seized

His wished ability he had himself

The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his

Measured to look upon you whom he loves

He bade me say somore than all the scepters

And those that bear them living

Good my lord

She came from Libya

Most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter

His tears proclaimed his parting with her Thence

A prosperous south wind friendly we have crossed

To execute the charge my father gave me

For visiting your Highness My best train

I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed

Who for Bohemia bend to signify

Not only my success in Libya sir

But my arrival and my wife's in safety

Here where we are

Camillo has betrayed me

Whose honor and whose honesty till now

Endured all weathers

We are not sir nor are we like to be

The stars I see will kiss the valleys first

The odds for high and low's alike

She is

When once she is my wife

Dear look up

Though Fortune visible an enemy

Should chase us with my father power no jot

Hath she to change our lovesBeseech you sir

Remember since you owed no more to time

Than I do now With thought of such affections

Step forth mine advocate At your request

My father will grant precious things as trifles
