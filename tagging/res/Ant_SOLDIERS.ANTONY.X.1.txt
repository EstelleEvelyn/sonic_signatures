Trust not to rotten planks Do you misdoubt

This sword and these my wounds Let th' Egyptians

And the Phoenicians go a-ducking We

Have used to conquer standing on the earth

And fighting foot to foot

By Hercules I think I am i' th' right

You keep by land

The legions and the horse whole do you not

While he was yet in Rome

His power went out in such distractions as

Beguiled all spies

They say one Taurus
