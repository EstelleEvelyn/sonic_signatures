


Last night I hear they lay at Stony Stratford

And at Northampton they do rest tonight

Tomorrow or next day they will be here

Here comes a messengerWhat news

For what offense

My gracious lady go

And thither bear your treasure and your goods

For my part I'll resign unto your Grace

The seal I keep and so betide to me

As well I tender you and all of yours

Go I'll conduct you to the sanctuary
