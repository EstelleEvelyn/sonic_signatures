Is touched corruptibly, and his pure brain,

Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house,

Doth, by the idle comments that it makes,

Foretell the ending of mortality.

Let him be brought into the orchard here.

Doth he still rage?

O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes

In their continuance will not feel themselves.

Death, having preyed upon the outward parts,

Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now

Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds

With many legions of strange fantasies,

Which in their throng and press to that last hold

Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that Death should sing.

I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,

Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,

And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings

His soul and body to their lasting rest.

How fares your Majesty?

O, that there were some virtue in my tears

That might relieve you!

Even so must I run on, and even so stop.

What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,

When this was now a king and now is clay?

At Worcester must his body be interred,

For so he willed it.

I have a kind soul that would give you thanks

And knows not how to do it but with tears.
