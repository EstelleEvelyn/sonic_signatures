Noble Ventidius. Well,

I am not of that feather to shake off

My friend when he must need me. I do know him

A gentleman that well deserves a help,

Which he shall have. I’ll pay the debt and free him.

Commend me to him. I will send his ransom;

And, being enfranchised, bid him come to me.

’Tis not enough to help the feeble up,

But to support him after. Fare you well.

Freely, good father.

I have so. What of him?

Attends he here or no?—Lucilius!

Well. What further?

The man is honest.

Does she love him?

Love you the maid?

How shall she be endowed

If she be mated with an equal husband?

This gentleman of mine hath served me long.

To build his fortune, I will strain a little,

For ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter.

What you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise,

And make him weigh with her.

My hand to thee; mine honor on my promise.

I thank you. You shall hear from me anon.

Go not away.—What have you there, my friend?

Painting is welcome.

The painting is almost the natural man,

For, since dishonor traffics with man’s nature,

He is but outside; these penciled figures are

Even such as they give out. I like your work,

And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance

Till you hear further from me.

Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand.

We must needs dine together.—Sir, your jewel

Hath suffered under praise.

A mere satiety of commendations.

If I should pay you for ’t as ’tis extolled,

It would unclew me quite.

Well mocked.

Look who comes here. Will you be chid?

Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus.

Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st them not.

Yes.

Thou art proud, Apemantus.

Whither art going?

That’s a deed thou ’lt die for.

How lik’st thou this picture, Apemantus?

Wrought he not well that painted it?

Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?

An thou shouldst, thou ’dst anger ladies.

That’s a lascivious apprehension.

How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?

What dost thou think ’tis worth?

What wouldst do then, Apemantus?

What? Thyself?

Wherefore?

What trumpet’s that?

Pray, entertain them. Give them guide to us.

You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence

Till I have thanked you.—When dinner’s done

Show me this piece.—I am joyful of your sights.

Most welcome, sir.

Right welcome, sir.

Ere we depart, we’ll share a bounteous time

In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.

O, by no means,

Honest Ventidius. You mistake my love.

I gave it freely ever, and there’s none

Can truly say he gives if he receives.

If our betters play at that game, we must not dare

To imitate them. Faults that are rich are fair.

Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devised at first

To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,

Recanting goodness, sorry ere ’tis shown;

But where there is true friendship, there needs none.

Pray, sit. More welcome are you to my fortunes

Than my fortunes to me.

O Apemantus, you are welcome.

Fie, thou ’rt a churl. You’ve got a humor there

Does not become a man. ’Tis much to blame.—

They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est, but yond

man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by

himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is

he fit for ’t indeed.

I take no heed of thee. Thou ’rt an Athenian,

therefore welcome. I myself would have no power;

prithee, let my meat make thee silent.

My lord, in heart! And let the health go round.

Captain Alcibiades, your heart’s in the field now.

You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies

than a dinner of friends.

O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods

themselves have provided that I shall have much

help from you. How had you been my friends else?

Why have you that charitable title from thousands,

did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told

more of you to myself than you can with modesty

speak in your own behalf. And thus far I confirm

you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any

friends if we should ne’er have need of ’em? They

were the most needless creatures living, should we

ne’er have use for ’em, and would most resemble

sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keeps

their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often

wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to

you. We are born to do benefits. And what better or

properer can we call our own than the riches of

our friends? O, what a precious comfort ’tis to

have so many, like brothers, commanding one

another’s fortunes. O, joy’s e’en made away ere ’t

can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water,

methinks. To forget their faults, I drink to you.

What means that trump?    How now?

Ladies? What are their wills?

I pray, let them be admitted.

They’re welcome all. Let ’em have kind admittance.

Music, make their welcome!

You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,

Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,

Which was not half so beautiful and kind.

You have added worth unto ’t and luster,

And entertained me with mine own device.

I am to thank you for ’t.

Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you.

Please you to dispose yourselves.

Flavius.

The little casket bring me hither.

O my friends, I have one word

To say to you. Look you, my good lord,

I must entreat you, honor me so much

As to advance this jewel. Accept it and wear it,

Kind my lord.

They are fairly welcome.

Near? Why, then, another time I’ll hear thee.

I prithee, let’s be provided to show them entertainment.

I shall accept them fairly. Let the presents

Be worthily entertained.    How now? What news?

I’ll hunt with him; and let them be received,

Not without fair reward.

You do yourselves much wrong.

You bate too much of your own merits.

Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.

And now I remember, my lord, you gave good

words the other day of a bay courser I rode on. ’Tis

yours because you liked it.

You may take my word, my lord. I know no man

Can justly praise but what he does affect.

I weigh my friends’ affection with mine own.

I’ll tell you true, I’ll call to you.

I take all and your several visitations

So kind to heart, ’tis not enough to give.

Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends

And ne’er be weary.—Alcibiades,

Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.

It comes in charity to thee, for all thy living

Is ’mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast

Lie in a pitched field.

And so am I to you.

All to you.—Lights, more lights.

Ready for his friends.

Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen,

I would be good to thee.

Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am

sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell, and

come with better music.

So soon as dinner’s done we’ll forth again,

My Alcibiades. With me? What is your will?

Dues? Whence are you?

Go to my steward.

Mine honest friend,

I prithee but repair to me next morning.

Contain thyself, good friend.

Give me breath.—

I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on.

I’ll wait upon you instantly.  Come hither. Pray you,

How goes the world that I am thus encountered

With clamorous demands of debt, broken bonds,

And the detention of long-since-due debts

Against my honor?

Do so, my friends.—

See them well entertained.

You make me marvel wherefore ere this time

Had you not fully laid my state before me,

That I might so have rated my expense

As I had leave of means.

Go to.

Perchance some single vantages you took

When my indisposition put you back,

And that unaptness made your minister

Thus to excuse yourself.

Let all my land be sold.

To Lacedaemon did my land extend.

You tell me true.

Prithee, no more.

Come, sermon me no further.

No villainous bounty yet hath passed my heart;

Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.

Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack

To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart.

If I would broach the vessels of my love

And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,

Men and men’s fortunes could I frankly use

As I can bid thee speak.

And in some sort these wants of mine are crowned,

That I account them blessings. For by these

Shall I try friends. You shall perceive how you

Mistake my fortunes. I am wealthy in my friends.—

Within there! Flaminius!—Servilius!

I will dispatch you severally.

You to Lord Lucius, to Lord

Lucullus you—I hunted with his Honor today;

you to Sempronius. Commend

me to their loves, and I am proud, say, that my

occasions have found time to use ’em toward a

supply of money. Let the request be fifty talents.

Go you, sir, to the Senators,

Of whom, even to the state’s best health, I have

Deserved this hearing. Bid ’em send o’ th’ instant

A thousand talents to me.

Is ’t true? Can ’t be?

You gods, reward them!

Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows

Have their ingratitude in them hereditary.

Their blood is caked, ’tis cold, it seldom flows;

’Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;

And nature, as it grows again toward earth,

Is fashioned for the journey, dull and heavy.

Go to Ventidius. Prithee, be not sad.

Thou art true and honest—ingeniously I speak—

No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately

Buried his father, by whose death he’s stepped

Into a great estate. When he was poor,

Imprisoned, and in scarcity of friends,

I cleared him with five talents. Greet him from me.

Bid him suppose some good necessity

Touches his friend, which craves to be remembered

With those five talents. That had, give ’t these fellows

To whom ’tis instant due. Ne’er speak or think

That Timon’s fortunes ’mong his friends can sink.

What, are my doors opposed against my passage?

Have I been ever free, and must my house

Be my retentive enemy, my jail?

The place which I have feasted, does it now,

Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?

Knock me down with ’em! Cleave me to the girdle.

Cut my heart in sums!

Tell out my blood.

Five thousand drops pays that.—What yours?—And yours?

Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!

They have e’en put my breath from me, the slaves!

Creditors? Devils!

What if it should be so?

I’ll have it so.—My steward!

So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,

Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius, all.

I’ll once more feast the rascals.

Be it not in thy care. Go,

I charge thee, invite them all. Let in the tide

Of knaves once more. My cook and I’ll provide.

With all my heart, gentlemen both! And how

fare you?

Nor more willingly leaves winter, such

summer birds are men.—Gentlemen, our dinner

will not recompense this long stay. Feast your ears

with the music awhile, if they will fare so harshly

o’ th’ trumpets’ sound. We shall to ’t presently.

O, sir, let it not trouble you.

Ah, my good friend, what cheer?

Think not on ’t, sir.

Let it not cumber your better remembrance.

Come, bring in all together.

My worthy friends, will you draw near?

Each man to his stool, with that spur as he

would to the lip of his mistress. Your diet shall

be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let

the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place.

Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks:

You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with

thankfulness. For your own gifts make yourselves

praised, but reserve still to give, lest your deities be

despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need

not lend to another; for, were your godheads to

borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make

the meat be beloved more than the man that gives

it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of

villains. If there sit twelve women at the table, let a

dozen of them be as they are. The rest of your fees,

O gods, the Senators of Athens, together with the

common tag of people, what is amiss in them,

you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these

my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so

in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they

welcome.

Uncover, dogs, and lap.

May you a better feast never behold,

You knot of mouth-friends! Smoke and lukewarm water

Is your perfection. This is Timon’s last,

Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,

Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces

Your reeking villainy.Live loathed and long,

Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,

Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,

You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time’s flies,

Cap-and-knee slaves, vapors, and minute-jacks.

Of man and beast the infinite malady

Crust you quite o’er! What, dost thou go?

Soft! Take thy physic first—thou too—and thou.—

Stay. I will lend thee money, borrow none.

What? All in motion? Henceforth be no feast

Whereat a villain’s not a welcome guest.

Burn, house! Sink, Athens! Henceforth hated be

Of Timon man and all humanity!

Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall

That girdles in those wolves, dive in the earth

And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!

Obedience fail in children! Slaves and fools,

Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench

And minister in their steads! To general filths

Convert o’ th’ instant, green virginity!

Do ’t in your parents’ eyes! Bankrupts, hold fast!

Rather than render back, out with your knives

And cut your trusters’ throats! Bound servants, steal!

Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,

And pill by law. Maid, to thy master’s bed!

Thy mistress is o’ th’ brothel. Son of sixteen,

Pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire;

With it beat out his brains! Piety and fear,

Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,

Domestic awe, night rest, and neighborhood,

Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,

Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,

Decline to your confounding contraries,

And yet confusion live! Plagues incident to men,

Your potent and infectious fevers heap

On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,

Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt

As lamely as their manners! Lust and liberty,

Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,

That ’gainst the stream of virtue they may strive

And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,

Sow all th’ Athenian bosoms, and their crop

Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,

That their society, as their friendship, may

Be merely poison! Nothing I’ll bear from thee

But nakedness, thou detestable town!

Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!

Timon will to the woods, where he shall find

Th’ unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.

The gods confound—hear me, you good gods all!—

Th’ Athenians both within and out that wall,

And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow

To the whole race of mankind, high and low!

Amen.

O blessèd breeding sun, draw from the Earth

Rotten humidity! Below thy sister’s orb

Infect the air! Twinned brothers of one womb,

Whose procreation, residence, and birth

Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,

The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature,

To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune

But by contempt of nature.

Raise me this beggar, and deny ’t that lord;

The Senators shall bear contempt hereditary,

The beggar native honor.

It is the pasture lards the brother’s sides,

The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares

In purity of manhood stand upright

And say “This man’s a flatterer”? If one be,

So are they all, for every grise of fortune

Is smoothed by that below. The learnèd pate

Ducks to the golden fool. All’s obliquy.

There’s nothing level in our cursèd natures

But direct villainy. Therefore be abhorred

All feasts, societies, and throngs of men.

His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains.

Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!

Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate

With thy most operant poison!What is here?

Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold?

No, gods, I am no idle votarist.

Roots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will make

Black white, foul fair, wrong right,

Base noble, old young, coward valiant.

Ha, you gods! Why this? What this, you gods? Why, this

Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,

Pluck stout men’s pillows from below their heads.

This yellow slave

Will knit and break religions, bless th’ accursed,

Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves

And give them title, knee, and approbation

With senators on the bench. This is it

That makes the wappened widow wed again;

She whom the spital house and ulcerous sores

Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices

To th’ April day again. Come, damnèd earth,

Thou common whore of mankind, that puts odds

Among the rout of nations, I will make thee

Do thy right nature. Ha? A drum? Thou ’rt quick,

But yet I’ll bury thee. Thou ’lt go, strong thief,

When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.

Nay, stay thou out for earnest.

A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart

For showing me again the eyes of man!

I am Misanthropos and hate mankind.

For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,

That I might love thee something.

I know thee too, and more than that I know thee

I not desire to know. Follow thy drum.

With man’s blood paint the ground gules, gules!

Religious canons, civil laws are cruel.

Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine

Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,

For all her cherubin look.

I will not kiss thee. Then the rot returns

To thine own lips again.

As the moon does, by wanting light to give.

But then renew I could not, like the moon;

There were no suns to borrow of.

None, but to maintain my opinion.

Promise me friendship, but perform none. If

thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for

thou art a man. If thou dost perform, confound

thee, for thou art a man.

Thou saw’st them when I had prosperity.

As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.

Art thou Timandra?

Be a whore still. They love thee not that use thee.

Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.

Make use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves

For tubs and baths. Bring down rose-cheeked youth

To the tub-fast and the diet.

I prithee, beat thy drum and get thee gone.

How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?

I had rather be alone.

Keep it. I cannot eat it.

Warr’st thou ’gainst Athens?

The gods confound them all in thy conquest,

And thee after, when thou hast conquered!

That by killing of villains

Thou wast born to conquer my country.

Put up thy gold. Go on. Here’s gold. Go on.

Be as a planetary plague when Jove

Will o’er some high-viced city hang his poison

In the sick air. Let not thy sword skip one.

Pity not honored age for his white beard;

He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron;

It is her habit only that is honest,

Herself’s a bawd. Let not the virgin’s cheek

Make soft thy trenchant sword, for those milk paps,

That through the window-bars bore at men’s eyes,

Are not within the leaf of pity writ,

But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe,

Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;

Think it a bastard whom the oracle

Hath doubtfully pronounced the throat shall cut,

And mince it sans remorse. Swear against objects;

Put armor on thine ears and on thine eyes,

Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,

Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,

Shall pierce a jot. There’s gold to pay thy soldiers.

Make large confusion and, thy fury spent,

Confounded be thyself! Speak not. Begone.

Dost thou or dost thou not, heaven’s curse upon thee!

Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,

And to make whores a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,

Your aprons mountant.You are not oathable,

Although I know you’ll swear—terribly swear

Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues

Th’ immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths.

I’ll trust to your conditions. Be whores still.

And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,

Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up.

Let your close fire predominate his smoke,

And be no turncoats. Yet may your pains six months

Be quite contrary. And thatch your poor thin roofs

With burdens of the dead—some that were hanged,

No matter; wear them, betray with them. Whore still.

Paint till a horse may mire upon your face.

A pox of wrinkles!

Consumptions sow

In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,

And mar men’s spurring. Crack the lawyer’s voice,

That he may never more false title plead

Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen,

That scolds against the quality of flesh

And not believes himself. Down with the nose—

Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away—

Of him that, his particular to foresee,

Smells from the general weal. Make curled-pate ruffians bald,

And let the unscarred braggarts of the war

Derive some pain from you. Plague all,

That your activity may defeat and quell

The source of all erection. There’s more gold.

Do you damn others, and let this damn you,

And ditches grave you all!

More whore, more mischief first! I have given you earnest.

If I hope well, I’ll never see thee more.

Yes, thou spok’st well of me.

Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take

Thy beagles with thee.

That nature, being sick of man’s unkindness,

Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou

Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast

Teems and feeds all; whose selfsame mettle—

Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puffed—

Engenders the black toad and adder blue,

The gilded newt and eyeless venomed worm,

With all th’ abhorrèd births below crisp heaven

Whereon Hyperion’s quick’ning fire doth shine:

Yield him who all thy human sons do hate,

From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!

Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb;

Let it no more bring out ingrateful man.

Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;

Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face

Hath to the marbled mansion all above

Never presented. O, a root! Dear thanks!

Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plow-torn leas,

Whereof ingrateful man with liquorish drafts

And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind,

That from it all consideration slips—

More man? Plague, plague!

’Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,

Whom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee!

Were I like thee, I’d throw away myself.

A fool of thee. Depart.

I hate thee worse.

Thou flatter’st misery.

Why dost thou seek me out?

Always a villain’s office or a fool’s.

Dost please thyself in ’t?

What, a knave too?

Not by his breath that is more miserable.

Thou art a slave whom Fortune’s tender arm

With favor never clasped but bred a dog.

Hadst thou, like us from our first swathe, proceeded

The sweet degrees that this brief world affords

To such as may the passive drugs of it

Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself

In general riot, melted down thy youth

In different beds of lust, and never learned

The icy precepts of respect, but followed

The sugared game before thee. But myself—

Who had the world as my confectionary,

The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men

At duty, more than I could frame employment,

That numberless upon me stuck as leaves

Do on the oak, have with one winter’s brush

Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare,

For every storm that blows—I to bear this,

That never knew but better, is some burden.

Thy nature did commence in sufferance. Time

Hath made thee hard in ’t. Why shouldst thou hate men?

They never flattered thee. What hast thou given?

If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,

Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff

To some she-beggar and compounded thee

Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, begone.

If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,

Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

Ay, that I am not thee.

I, that I am one now.

Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,

I’d give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.

That the whole life of Athens were in this!

Thus would I eat it.

First mend my company. Take away thyself.

’Tis not well mended so; it is but botched.

If not, I would it were.

Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,

Tell them there I have gold. Look, so I have.

The best and truest,

For here it sleeps and does no hired harm.

Under that’s above me. Where feed’st thou

a-days, Apemantus?

Would poison were obedient and knew my

mind!

To sauce thy dishes.

On what I hate I feed not.

Ay, though it look like thee.

Who, without those means thou talk’st of, didst

thou ever know beloved?

I understand thee. Thou hadst some means to

keep a dog.

Women nearest, but men—men are the things

themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,

Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?

Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion

of men and remain a beast with the beasts?

A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee

t’ attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would

beguile thee. If thou wert the lamb, the fox would

eat thee. If thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect

thee when peradventure thou wert accused by

the ass. If thou wert the ass, thy dullness would

torment thee, and still thou lived’st but as a breakfast

to the wolf. If thou wert the wolf, thy greediness

would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard

thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the unicorn,

pride and wrath would confound thee and

make thine own self the conquest of thy fury. Wert

thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse.

Wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the

leopard. Wert thou a leopard, thou wert germane

to the lion, and the spots of thy kindred were

jurors on thy life. All thy safety were remotion, and

thy defense absence. What beast couldst thou be

that were not subject to a beast? And what a beast

art thou already that seest not thy loss in

transformation!

How, has the ass broke the wall that thou art

out of the city?

When there is nothing living but thee, thou

shalt be welcome. I had rather be a beggar’s dog

than Apemantus.

Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!

All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

If I name thee.

I’ll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.

Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!

Choler does kill me that thou art alive.

I swoon to see thee.

Away, thou tedious rogue!

I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee.

Slave!

Rogue, rogue, rogue!

I am sick of this false world, and will love nought

But even the mere necessities upon ’t.

Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave.

Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat

Thy gravestone daily. Make thine epitaph,

That death in me at others’ lives may laugh.

O thou sweet king-killer and dear divorce

’Twixt natural son and sire, thou bright defiler

Of Hymen’s purest bed, thou valiant Mars,

Thou ever young, fresh, loved, and delicate wooer,

Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow

That lies on Dian’s lap; thou visible god,

That sold’rest close impossibilities

And mak’st them kiss, that speak’st with every tongue

To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts,

Think thy slave, man, rebels, and by thy virtue

Set them into confounding odds, that beasts

May have the world in empire!

Thronged to?

Thy back, I prithee.

Long live so, and so die. I am quit.

Now, thieves?

Both, too, and women’s sons.

Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.

Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots.

Within this mile break forth a hundred springs.

The oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips.

The bounteous huswife Nature on each bush

Lays her full mess before you. Want? Why want?

Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds and fishes;

You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con

That you are thieves professed, that you work not

In holier shapes, for there is boundless theft

In limited professions. Rascal thieves,

Here’s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o’ th’ grape

Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,

And so ’scape hanging. Trust not the physician;

His antidotes are poison, and he slays

More than you rob. Take wealth and lives together.

Do, villainy, do, since you protest to do ’t,

Like workmen. I’ll example you with thievery.

The sun’s a thief and with his great attraction

Robs the vast sea. The moon’s an arrant thief,

And her pale fire she snatches from the sun.

The sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves

The moon into salt tears. The earth’s a thief,

That feeds and breeds by a composture stol’n

From gen’ral excrement. Each thing’s a thief.

The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power

Has unchecked theft. Love not yourselves. Away!

Rob one another. There’s more gold.Cut throats.

All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go.

Break open shops. Nothing can you steal

But thieves do lose it. Steal less for this I give you,

And gold confound you howsoe’er! Amen.

Away! What art thou?

Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men.

Then, if thou grant’st thou ’rt a man, I have forgot thee.

Then I know thee not.

I never had honest man about me, I. All

I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains.

What, dost thou weep? Come nearer, then. I love thee

Because thou art a woman and disclaim’st

Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give

But thorough lust and laughter. Pity’s sleeping.

Strange times that weep with laughing, not with weeping!

Had I a steward

So true, so just, and now so comfortable?

It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.

Let me behold thy face. Surely this man

Was born of woman.

Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,

You perpetual-sober gods. I do proclaim

One honest man—mistake me not, but one;

No more, I pray!—and he’s a steward.

How fain would I have hated all mankind,

And thou redeem’st thyself. But all, save thee,

I fell with curses.

Methinks thou art more honest now than wise,

For by oppressing and betraying me

Thou mightst have sooner got another service;

For many so arrive at second masters

Upon their first lord’s neck. But tell me true—

For I must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure—

Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,

A usuring kindness, and as rich men deal gifts,

Expecting in return twenty for one?

Look thee, ’tis so. Thou singly honest man,

Here, take. The gods out of my misery

Has sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,

But thus conditioned: thou shalt build from men;

Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,

But let the famished flesh slide from the bone

Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs

What thou deniest to men; let prisons swallow ’em,

Debts wither ’em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,

And may diseases lick up their false bloods!

And so farewell and thrive.

If thou hat’st curses,

Stay not. Fly whilst thou art blest and free.

Ne’er see thou man, and let me ne’er see thee.

Excellent workman! Thou canst not

paint a man so bad as is thyself.

Must thou needs stand for a villain in

thine own work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults

in other men? Do so. I have gold for thee.

I’ll meet you at the turn. What a god’s gold

That he is worshiped in a baser temple

Than where swine feed!

’Tis thou that rigg’st the bark and plow’st the foam,

Settlest admirèd reverence in a slave.

To thee be worship, and thy saints for aye

Be crowned with plagues, that thee alone obey!

Fit I meet them.

Have I once lived to see two honest men?

Let it go naked. Men may see ’t the better.

You that are honest, by being what you are

Make them best seen and known.

Ay, you are honest men.

Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?

Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No?

You’re honest men. You’ve heard that I have gold.

I am sure you have. Speak truth. You’re honest men.

Good honest men. Thou draw’st a counterfeit

Best in all Athens. Thou ’rt indeed the best.

Thou counterfeit’st most lively.

E’en so, sir, as I say. And for thy fiction,

Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth

That thou art even natural in thine art.

But for all this, my honest-natured friends,

I must needs say you have a little fault.

Marry, ’tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I

You take much pains to mend.

You’ll take it ill.

Will you indeed?

There’s never a one of you but trusts a knave

That mightily deceives you.

Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,

Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,

Keep in your bosom. Yet remain assured

That he’s a made-up villain.

Look you, I love you well. I’ll give you gold.

Rid me these villains from your companies,

Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draft,

Confound them by some course, and come to me,

I’ll give you gold enough.

You that way and you this, but two in company.

Each man apart, all single and alone,

Yet an archvillain keeps him company.

If where thou art, two villains shall not be,

Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside

But where one villain is, then him abandon.—

Hence, pack. There’s gold. You came for gold, you slaves.

You have work for me. There’s payment. Hence.

You are an alchemist; make gold of that.

Out, rascal dogs!

Thou sun that comforts, burn!—Speak and be hanged!

For each true word a blister, and each false

Be as a cauterizing to the root o’ th’ tongue,

Consuming it with speaking.

Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.

I thank them and would send them back the plague,

Could I but catch it for them.

You witch me in it,

Surprise me to the very brink of tears.

Lend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes,

And I’ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

Well sir, I will. Therefore I will, sir, thus:

If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,

Let Alcibiades know this of Timon—

That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens

And take our goodly agèd men by th’ beards,

Giving our holy virgins to the stain

Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brained war,

Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it

In pity of our agèd and our youth,

I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,

And let him take ’t at worst—for their knives care not,

While you have throats to answer. For myself,

There’s not a whittle in th’ unruly camp

But I do prize it at my love before

The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you

To the protection of the prosperous gods

As thieves to keepers.

Why, I was writing of my epitaph.

It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness

Of health and living now begins to mend,

And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still.

Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,

And last so long enough!

But yet I love my country and am not

One that rejoices in the common wrack,

As common bruit doth put it.

Commend me to my loving countrymen.

Commend me to them

And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,

Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,

Their pangs of love, with other incident throes

That nature’s fragile vessel doth sustain

In life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them.

I’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.

I have a tree, which grows here in my close,

That mine own use invites me to cut down,

And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,

Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree

From high to low throughout, that whoso please

To stop affliction, let him take his haste,

Come hither ere my tree hath felt the ax,

And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.

Come not to me again, but say to Athens,

Timon hath made his everlasting mansion

Upon the beachèd verge of the salt flood,

Who once a day with his embossèd froth

The turbulent surge shall cover. Thither come

And let my gravestone be your oracle.

Lips, let four words go by and language end.

What is amiss, plague and infection mend.

Graves only be men’s works, and death their gain.

Sun, hide thy beams. Timon hath done his reign.
