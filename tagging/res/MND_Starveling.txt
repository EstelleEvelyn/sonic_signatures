That would hang us, every mother’s son.

I believe we must leave the killing out,

when all is done.

I fear it, I promise you.

He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he

is transported.

This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.

This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.

Myself the man i’ th’ moon do seem to be.

 All that I have to say is to tell

you that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i’ th’

moon, this thornbush my thornbush, and this dog

my dog.
