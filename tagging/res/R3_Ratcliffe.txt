Make haste. The hour of death is expiate.

Come, come, dispatch. The Duke would be at dinner.

Make a short shrift. He longs to see your head.

My lord.

Bad news, my lord. Morton is fled to Richmond,

And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen,

Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast

Rideth a puissant navy. To our shores

Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,

Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.

’Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;

And there they hull, expecting but the aid

Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?

Your Highness told me I should post before.

My lord.

Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,

Much about cockshut time, from troop to troop

Went through the army cheering up the soldiers.

It is, my lord.

My lord.

Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I. The early village cock

Hath twice done salutation to the morn.

Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.

No doubt, my lord.

Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

That he was never trainèd up in arms.

He smiled and said “The better for our purpose.”

Not I, my lord.

My lord.
