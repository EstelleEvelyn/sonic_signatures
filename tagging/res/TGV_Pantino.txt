He wondered that your Lordship

Would suffer him to spend his youth at home

While other men, of slender reputation,

Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:

Some to the wars to try their fortune there,

Some to discover islands far away,

Some to the studious universities.

For any or for all these exercises

He said that Proteus your son was meet,

And did request me to importune you

To let him spend his time no more at home,

Which would be great impeachment to his age

In having known no travel in his youth.

I think your Lordship is not ignorant

How his companion, youthful Valentine,

Attends the Emperor in his royal court.

’Twere good, I think, your Lordship sent him thither.

There shall he practice tilts and tournaments,

Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,

And be in eye of every exercise

Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.

Tomorrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,

With other gentlemen of good esteem,

Are journeying to salute the Emperor

And to commend their service to his will.

Sir Proteus, your father calls for you.

He is in haste. Therefore, I pray you, go.

Sir Proteus, you are stayed for.

Lance, away, away! Aboard. Thy master is

shipped, and thou art to post after with oars. What’s

the matter? Why weep’st thou, man? Away, ass.

You’ll lose the tide if you tarry any longer.

What’s the unkindest tide?

Tut, man. I mean thou ’lt lose the flood and, in

losing the flood, lose thy voyage and, in losing thy

voyage, lose thy master and, in losing thy master,

lose thy service and, in losing thy service—

Why dost thou stop my

mouth?

Where should I lose my tongue?

In thy tail!

Come. Come away, man. I was sent to call

thee.

Wilt thou go?
