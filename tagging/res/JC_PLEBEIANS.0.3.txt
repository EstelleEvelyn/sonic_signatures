


We will be satisfied Let us be satisfied

The noble Brutus is ascended Silence

None Brutus none

Live Brutus live live

Let him be Caesar

Let him go up into the public chair

We'll hear himNoble Antony go up

He says for Brutus' sake

He finds himself beholding to us all

Nay that's certain

We are blest that Rome is rid of him

Peace ho Let us hear him

Has he masters

I fear there will a worse come in his place

There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony

The will the will We will hear Caesar's will

You shall read us the will Caesar's will

The will The testament

Come down

You shall have leave

Stand back Room Bear back

O woeful day

Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill

Slay Let not a traitor live

We'll mutiny

Away then Come seek the conspirators

Peace ho Hear Antony most noble Antony

Most true The will Let's stay and hear the will

O royal Caesar

Peace ho

Pluck down benches

Where do you dwell

Ay and truly you were best

Your name sir truly

Tear him tear him Come brands ho

firebrands To Brutus' to Cassius' burn all Some

to Decius' house and some to Casca's some to

Ligarius' Away go
