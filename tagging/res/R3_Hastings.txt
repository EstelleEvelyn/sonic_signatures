


Good time of day unto my gracious lord

With patience noble lord as prisoners must

But I shall live my lord to give them thanks

That were the cause of my imprisonment

More pity that the eagles should be mewed

Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty

No news so bad abroad as this at home

The King is sickly weak and melancholy

And his physicians fear him mightily

He is

O 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe

And the most merciless that e'er was heard of

False-boding woman end thy frantic curse

Lest to thy harm thou move our patience

So thrive I as I truly swear the like

So prosper I as I swear perfect love

And so swear I

And so say I

On what occasion God He knows not I

The Queen your mother and your brother York

Have taken sanctuary The tender prince

Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace

But by his mother was perforce withheld

I go my lord

Who knocks

What is 't o'clock

Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights

What then

Go fellow go Return unto thy lord

Bid him not fear the separated council

His Honor and myself are at the one

And at the other is my good friend Catesby

Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us

Whereof I shall not have intelligence

Tell him his fears are shallow without instance

And for his dreams I wonder he's so simple

To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers

To fly the boar before the boar pursues

Were to incense the boar to follow us

And make pursuit where he did mean no chase

Go bid thy master rise and come to me

And we will both together to the Tower

Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly

Good morrow Catesby You are early stirring

What news what news in this our tott'ring state

How wear the garland Dost thou mean the crown

I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders

Before I'll see the crown so foul misplaced

But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it

Indeed I am no mourner for that news

Because they have been still my adversaries

But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side

To bar my master's heirs in true descent

God knows I will not do it to the death

But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence

That they which brought me in my master's hate

I live to look upon their tragedy

Well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older

I'll send some packing that yet think not on 't

O monstrous monstrous And so falls it out

With Rivers Vaughan Grey and so 'twill do

With some men else that think themselves as safe

As thou and I who as thou know'st are dear

To princely Richard and to Buckingham

I know they do and I have well deserved it

Come on come on Where is your boar-spear man

Fear you the boar and go so unprovided

My lord I hold my life as dear as you do yours

And never in my days I do protest

Was it so precious to me as 'tis now

Think you but that I know our state secure

I would be so triumphant as I am

Come come Have with you Wot you what my lord

Today the lords you talked of are beheaded

Go on before I'll talk with this good fellow

How now sirrah How goes the world with thee

I tell thee man 'tis better with me now

Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet

Then was I going prisoner to the Tower

By the suggestion of the Queen's allies

But now I tell theekeep it to thyself

This day those enemies are put to death

And I in better state than e'er I was

Gramercy fellow There drink that for me

I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart

I am in your debt for your last exercise

Come the next sabbath and I will content you

Good faith and when I met this holy man

The men you talk of came into my mind

What go you toward the Tower

Nay like enough for I stay dinner there

I'll wait upon your Lordship

Now noble peers the cause why we are met

Is to determine of the coronation

In God's name speak When is the royal day

I thank his Grace I know he loves me well

But for his purpose in the coronation

I have not sounded him nor he delivered

His gracious pleasure any way therein

But you my honorable lords may name the time

And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice

Which I presume he'll take in gentle part

His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning

There's some conceit or other likes him well

When that he bids good morrow with such spirit

I think there's never a man in Christendom

Can lesser hide his love or hate than he

For by his face straight shall you know his heart

Marry that with no man here he is offended

For were he he had shown it in his looks

The tender love I bear your Grace my lord

Makes me most forward in this princely presence

To doom th' offenders whosoe'er they be

I say my lord they have deservd death

If they have done this deed my noble lord

Woe woe for England Not a whit for me

For I too fond might have prevented this

Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm

And I did scorn it and disdain to fly

Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble

And started when he looked upon the Tower

As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse

O now I need the priest that spake to me

I now repent I told the pursuivant

As too triumphing how mine enemies

Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered

And I myself secure in grace and favor

O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse

Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head

O momentary grace of mortal men

Which we more hunt for than the grace of God

Who builds his hope in air of your good looks

Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast

Ready with every nod to tumble down

Into the fatal bowels of the deep

O bloody Richard Miserable England

I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee

That ever wretched age hath looked upon

Come lead me to the block Bear him my head

They smile at me who shortly shall be dead

Bloody and guilty guiltily awake

And in a bloody battle end thy days

Think on Lord Hastings Despair and die

Quiet untroubled soul awake awake

Arm fight and conquer for fair England's sake
