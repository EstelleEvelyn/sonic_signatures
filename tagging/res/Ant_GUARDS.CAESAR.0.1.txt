Caesar hath sent—

Approach, ho! All’s not well. Caesar’s beguiled.

What work is here, Charmian? Is this well done?

A simple countryman that brought her figs.

This was his basket.

O Caesar,

This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.

I found her trimming up the diadem

On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,

And on the sudden dropped.

This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves

Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves

Upon the caves of Nile.
