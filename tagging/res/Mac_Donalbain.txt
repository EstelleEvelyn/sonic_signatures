What should be spoken here, where our fate,

Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?

Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brewed.

So all.

Well contented.

To Ireland I. Our separated fortune

Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,

There’s daggers in men’s smiles. The near in blood,

The nearer bloody.
