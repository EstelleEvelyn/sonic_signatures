
Hearts of most hard temper

Melt and lament for her.

Alas, poor lady,

She’s a stranger now again!

Our content

Is our best having.

Beshrew me, I would,

And venture maidenhead for ’t; and so would you,

For all this spice of your hypocrisy.

You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,

Have too a woman’s heart, which ever yet

Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;

Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,

Saving your mincing, the capacity

Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive

If you might please to stretch it.

Yes, troth, and troth. You would not be a queen?

’Tis strange. A threepence bowed would hire me,

Old as I am, to queen it. But I pray you,

What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs

To bear that load of title?

Then you are weakly made. Pluck off a little.

I would not be a young count in your way

For more than blushing comes to. If your back

Cannot vouchsafe this burden, ’tis too weak

Ever to get a boy.

In faith, for little England

You’d venture an emballing. I myself

Would for Carnarvanshire, although there longed

No more to th’ crown but that. Lo, who comes here?

Why, this it is! See, see!

I have been begging sixteen years in court,

Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could

Come pat betwixt too early and too late

For any suit of pounds; and you—O, fate!—

A very fresh fish here—fie, fie, fie upon

This compelled fortune!—have your mouth filled up

Before you open it.

How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no.

There was a lady once—’tis an old story—

That would not be a queen, that would she not,

For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it?

With your theme, I could

O’ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke?

A thousand pounds a year for pure respect?

No other obligation? By my life,

That promises more thousands; honor’s train

Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time

I know your back will bear a duchess. Say,

Are you not stronger than you were?

What do you think me?

I’ll not come back! The tidings that I bring

Will make my boldness manners.—Now, good angels

Fly o’er thy royal head and shade thy person

Under their blessèd wings!

Ay, ay, my liege,

And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven

Both now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl

Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen

Desires your visitation, and to be

Acquainted with this stranger. ’Tis as like you

As cherry is to cherry.

An hundred marks? By this light, I’ll ha’ more.

An ordinary groom is for such payment.

I will have more or scold it out of him.

Said I for this the girl was like to him?

I’ll have more or else unsay ’t. And now,

While ’tis hot, I’ll put it to the issue.
