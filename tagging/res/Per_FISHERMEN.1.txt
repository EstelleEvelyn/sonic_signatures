What, Patchbreech, I say!

Look how thou stirr’st now! Come

away, or I’ll fetch thee with a wanion.

Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart

to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help

them, when, welladay, we could scarce help

ourselves!

Why, as men do a-land: the great

ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich

misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: he plays

and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him and

at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such

whales have I heard on a’ the land, who never leave

gaping till they swallowed the whole parish—

church, steeple, bells and all.

No, friend, cannot you beg? Here’s

them in our country of Greece gets more with begging

than we can do with working.

Die, quotha? Now gods forbid ’t, an I

have a gown. Here, come, put it on; keep thee

warm. Now, afore

me, a handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home,

and we’ll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting

days, and, moreo’er, puddings and flapjacks, and

thou shalt be welcome.

Hark you, sir, do you know where

you are?

Why, I’ll tell you. This is called Pentapolis,

and our king the good Simonides.

Ay, sir, and he deserves so to be called

for his peaceable reign and good government.

Marry, sir, half a day’s journey. And

I’ll tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and tomorrow

is her birthday; and there are princes and knights

come from all parts of the world to joust and tourney

for her love.

O, sir, things must be as they may;

and what a man cannot get he may lawfully deal

for his wife’s soul.

What mean you, sir?

Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?

Why, do ’ee take it, and the gods give

thee good on ’t.
