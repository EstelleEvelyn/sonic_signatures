


In that you brook it ill it makes him worse

Therefore for God's sake entertain good comfort

And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes

No other harm but loss of such a lord

The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son

To be your comforter when he is gone

Here comes the lord of Buckingham and Derby

To who in all this presence speaks your Grace

God bless the Prince from all the pack of you

A knot you are of damnd bloodsuckers

Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads

When she exclaimed on Hastings you and I

For standing by when Richard stabbed her son

Think upon Grey and let thy soul despair

Awake and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom

Will conquer him Awake and win the day
