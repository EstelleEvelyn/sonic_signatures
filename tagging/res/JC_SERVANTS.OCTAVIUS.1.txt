He did receive his letters and is coming,

And bid me say to you by word of mouth—

O Caesar!

He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.

Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.

He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.

I heard him say Brutus and Cassius

Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
