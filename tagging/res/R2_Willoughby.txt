


Barely in title not in revenues

Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford

If it be so out with it boldly man

Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him

And daily new exactions are devised

As blanks benevolences and I wot not what

But what i' God's name doth become of this

The King grown bankrupt like a broken man

Nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours

Hold out my horse and I will first be there

And far surmounts our labor to attain it

Base men by his endowments are made great
