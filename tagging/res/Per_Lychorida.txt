


Here is a thing too young for such a place

Who if it had conceit would die as I

Am like to do Take in your arms this piece

Of your dead queen

Patience good sir Do not assist the storm

Here's all that is left living of your queen

A little daughter For the sake of it

Be manly and take comfort

Patience good sir

Even for this charge

Here she lies sir
