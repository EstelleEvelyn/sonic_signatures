Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes.

So looks the pent-up lion o’er the wretch

That trembles under his devouring paws;

And so he walks, insulting o’er his prey;

And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder.

Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword

And not with such a cruel threat’ning look.

Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.

I am too mean a subject for thy wrath.

Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.

Then let my father’s blood open it again;

He is a man and, Clifford, cope with him.

O, let me pray before I take my death!

To thee I pray: sweet Clifford, pity me!

I never did thee harm. Why wilt thou slay me?

But ’twas ere I was born.

Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,

Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,

He be as miserably slain as I.

Ah, let me live in prison all my days,

And when I give occasion of offense

Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.

Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
