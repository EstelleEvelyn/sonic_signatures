


I can but say their protestation over

So much dear liege I have already sworn

That is to live and study here three years

But there are other strict observances

As not to see a woman in that term

Which I hope well is not enrolld there

And one day in a week to touch no food

And but one meal on every day besides

The which I hope is not enrolld there

And then to sleep but three hours in the night

And not be seen to wink of all the day

When I was wont to think no harm all night

And make a dark night too of half the day

Which I hope well is not enrolld there

O these are barren tasks too hard to keep

Not to see ladies study fast not sleep

Let me say no my liege an if you please

I only swore to study with your Grace

And stay here in your court for three years' space

By yea and nay sir Then I swore in jest

What is the end of study let me know

Things hid and barred you mean from common sense

Come on then I will swear to study so

To know the thing I am forbid to know

As thusto study where I well may dine

When I to feast expressly am forbid

Or study where to meet some mistress fine

When mistresses from common sense are hid

Or having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath

Study to break it and not break my troth

If study's gain be thus and this be so

Study knows that which yet it doth not know

Swear me to this and I will ne'er say no

Why all delights are vain and that most vain

Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain

As painfully to pore upon a book

To seek the light of truth while truth the while

Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look

Light seeking light doth light of light beguile

So ere you find where light in darkness lies

Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes

Study me how to please the eye indeed

By fixing it upon a fairer eye

Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed

And give him light that it was blinded by

Study is like the heaven's glorious sun

That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks

Small have continual plodders ever won

Save base authority from others' books

These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights

That give a name to every fixd star

Have no more profit of their shining nights

Than those that walk and wot not what they are

Too much to know is to know naught but fame

And every godfather can give a name

The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding

Fit in his place and time

Something then in rhyme

Well say I am Why should proud summer boast

Before the birds have any cause to sing

Why should I joy in any abortive birth

At Christmas I no more desire a rose

Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows

But like of each thing that in season grows

So you to study now it is too late

Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate

No my good lord I have sworn to stay with you

And though I have for barbarism spoke more

Than for that angel knowledge you can say

Yet confident I'll keep what I have sworn

And bide the penance of each three years' day

Give me the paper Let me read the same

And to the strictest decrees I'll write my name

Item That no woman shall come within

a mile of my court Hath this been proclaimed

Let's see the penalty On pain of

losing her tongue Who devised this penalty

Sweet lord and why

A dangerous law against gentility

Item If any man be seen to talk with a

woman within the term of three years he shall endure

such public shame as the rest of the court can possible

devise

This article my liege yourself must break

For well you know here comes in embassy

The French king's daughter with yourself to speak

A maid of grace and complete majesty

About surrender up of Aquitaine

To her decrepit sick and bedrid father

Therefore this article is made in vain

Or vainly comes th' admird princess hither

So study evermore is overshot

While it doth study to have what it would

It doth forget to do the thing it should

And when it hath the thing it hunteth most

'Tis won as towns with fireso won so lost

Necessity will make us all forsworn

Three thousand times within this three years' space

For every man with his affects is born

Not by might mastered but by special grace

If I break faith this word shall speak for me

I am forsworn on mere necessity

So to the laws at large I write my name

And he that breaks them in the least degree

Stands in attainder of eternal shame

Suggestions are to other as to me

But I believe although I seem so loath

I am the last that will last keep his oath

But is there no quick recreation granted

Armado is a most illustrious wight

A man of fire-new words fashion's own knight

This fellow What wouldst

This is he

How low soever the matter I hope in God

for high words

To hear or forbear hearing

Well sir be it as the style shall give us cause

to climb in the merriness

In what manner

For the following sir

As we would hear an oracle

This is not so well as I looked for but the

best that ever I heard

It is so varied too for it was proclaimed

virgin

I'll lay my head to any goodman's hat

These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn

Sirrah come on

Did not I dance with you in Brabant once

I know you did

You must not be so quick

Your wit's too hot it speeds too fast 'twill tire

What time o' day

Now fair befall your mask

And send you many lovers

Nay then will I be gone

Lady I will commend you to

my own heart

I would you heard it groan

Sick at the heart

Would that do it good

Will you prick 't with your eye

Now God save thy life

I cannot stay thanksgiving

What's her name in the cap

Is she wedded or no

You are welcome sir Adieu

My good knave Costard exceedingly well

met

What is a remuneration

Why then three farthing worth of silk

Stay slave I must employ thee

As thou wilt win my favor good my knave

Do one thing for me that I shall entreat

This afternoon

Thou knowest not what it is

Why villain thou must know first

It must be done this afternoon Hark slave

it is but this

The Princess comes to hunt here in the park

And in her train there is a gentle lady

When tongues speak sweetly then they name her name

And Rosaline they call her Ask for her

And to her white hand see thou do commend

This sealed-up counsel There's thy guerdonGo

And I forsooth in love I that have been love's whip

A very beadle to a humorous sigh

A critic nay a nightwatch constable

A domineering pedant o'er the boy

Than whom no mortal so magnificent

This wimpled whining purblind wayward boy

This Signior Junior giant dwarf Dan Cupid

Regent of love rhymes lord of folded arms

Th' anointed sovereign of sighs and groans

Liege of all loiterers and malcontents

Dread prince of plackets king of codpieces

Sole imperator and great general

Of trotting paritorsO my little heart

And I to be a corporal of his field

And wear his colors like a tumbler's hoop

What I love I sue I seek a wife

A woman that is like a German clock

Still a-repairing ever out of frame

And never going aright being a watch

But being watched that it may still go right

Nay to be perjured which is worst of all

And among three to love the worst of all

A whitely wanton with a velvet brow

With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes

Ay and by heaven one that will do the deed

Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard

And I to sigh for her to watch for her

To pray for her Go to It is a plague

That Cupid will impose for my neglect

Of his almighty dreadful little might

Well I will love write sigh pray sue groan

Some men must love my lady and some Joan

The King he is hunting the deer I am

coursing myself They have pitched a toil I am

toiling in a pitchpitch that defiles Defile A foul

word Well set thee down sorrow for so they

say the fool said and so say I and I the fool Well

proved wit By the Lord this love is as mad as Ajax

It kills sheep it kills me I a sheep Well proved

again o' my side I will not love If I do hang me I'

faith I will not O but her eye By this light but for

her eye I would not love her yes for her two eyes

Well I do nothing in the world but lie and lie in my

throat By heaven I do love and it hath taught me to

rhyme and to be melancholy And here is part of my

rhyme and here my melancholy Well she hath one

o' my sonnets already The clown bore it the fool

sent it and the lady hath it Sweet clown sweeter

fool sweetest lady By the world I would not care a

pin if the other three were in Here comes one with

a paper God give him grace to groan

Shot by heaven Proceed sweet

Cupid Thou hast thumped him with thy birdbolt

under the left pap In faith secrets

Now in thy likeness one more fool appear

Why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers

One drunkard loves another of the name

I could put thee in comfort not by two that I know

Thou makest the triumviry the corner-cap of society

The shape of love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity

O rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose

Disfigure not his shop

This is the liver vein which makes flesh a deity

A green goose a goddess Pure pure idolatry

God amend us God amend We are much out o' th' way

All hid all hidan old infant play

Like a demigod here sit I in the sky

And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye

More sacks to the mill O heavens I have my wish

Dumaine transformed Four woodcocks in a dish

O most profane coxcomb

By Earth she is not corporal There you lie

An amber-colored raven was well noted

Stoop I say

Her shoulder is with child

Ay as some days but then no sun must shine

Amen so I had mine Is not that a good word

A fever in your blood Why then incision

Would let her out in saucers Sweet misprision

Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit

Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy

Ah good my liege I pray thee pardon me

Good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove

These worms for loving that art most in love

Your eyes do make no coaches in your tears

There is no certain princess that appears

You'll not be perjured 'tis a hateful thing

Tush none but minstrels like of sonneting

But are you not ashamed Nay are you not

All three of you to be thus much o'ershot

You found his mote the King your mote did see

But I a beam do find in each of three

O what a scene of fool'ry have I seen

Of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen

O me with what strict patience have I sat

To see a king transformd to a gnat

To see great Hercules whipping a gig

And profound Solomon to tune a jig

And Nestor play at pushpin with the boys

And critic Timon laugh at idle toys

Where lies thy grief O tell me good Dumaine

And gentle Longaville where lies thy pain

And where my liege's All about the breast

A caudle ho

Not you to me but I betrayed by you

I that am honest I that hold it sin

To break the vow I am engagd in

I am betrayed by keeping company

With men like you men of inconstancy

When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme

Or groan for Joan or spend a minute's time

In pruning me When shall you hear that I

Will praise a hand a foot a face an eye

A gait a state a brow a breast a waist

A leg a limb

I post from love Good lover let me go

A toy my liege a toy Your Grace needs not fear it

Ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born to do me shame

Guilty my lord guilty I confess I confess

That you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess

He he and youand you my liegeand I

Are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die

O dismiss this audience and I shall tell you more

True true we are four

Will these turtles be gone

Sweet lords sweet lovers O let us embrace

As true we are as flesh and blood can be

The sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face

Young blood doth not obey an old decree

We cannot cross the cause why we were born

Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn

Did they quoth you Who sees the heavenly Rosaline

That like a rude and savage man of Ind

At the first op'ning of the gorgeous East

Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind

Kisses the base ground with obedient breast

What peremptory eagle-sighted eye

Dares look upon the heaven of her brow

That is not blinded by her majesty

My eyes are then no eyes nor I Berowne

O but for my love day would turn to night

Of all complexions the culled sovereignty

Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek

Where several worthies make one dignity

Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek

Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues

Fie painted rhetoric O she needs it not

To things of sale a seller's praise belongs

She passes praise Then praise too short doth blot

A withered hermit fivescore winters worn

Might shake off fifty looking in her eye

Beauty doth varnish age as if newborn

And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy

O 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine

Is ebony like her O word divine

A wife of such wood were felicity

O who can give an oath Where is a book

That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack

If that she learn not of her eye to look

No face is fair that is not full so black

Devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light

O if in black my lady's brows be decked

It mourns that painting and usurping hair

Should ravish doters with a false aspect

And therefore is she born to make black fair

Her favor turns the fashion of the days

For native blood is counted painting now

And therefore red that would avoid dispraise

Paints itself black to imitate her brow

Your mistresses dare never come in rain

For fear their colors should be washed away

I'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here

O if the streets were pavd with thine eyes

Her feet were much too dainty for such tread

Nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn

O 'tis more than need

Have at you then affection's men-at-arms

O we have made a vow to study lords

And in that vow we have forsworn our books

For when would you my liege or you or you

In leaden contemplation have found out

Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes

Of beauty's tutors have enriched you with

Other slow arts entirely keep the brain

And therefore finding barren practicers

Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil

But love first learnd in a lady's eyes

Lives not alone immurd in the brain

But with the motion of all elements

Courses as swift as thought in every power

And gives to every power a double power

Above their functions and their offices

It adds a precious seeing to the eye

A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind

A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound

When the suspicious head of theft is stopped

Love's feeling is more soft and sensible

Than are the tender horns of cockled snails

Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste

For valor is not love a Hercules

Still climbing trees in the Hesperides

Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical

As bright Apollo's lute strung with his hair

And when love speaks the voice of all the gods

Make heaven drowsy with the harmony

Never durst poet touch a pen to write

Until his ink were tempered with love's sighs

O then his lines would ravish savage ears

And plant in tyrants mild humility

From women's eyes this doctrine I derive

They sparkle still the right Promethean fire

They are the books the arts the academes

That show contain and nourish all the world

Else none at all in ought proves excellent

Then fools you were these women to forswear

Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools

For wisdom's sake a word that all men love

Or for love's sake a word that loves all men

Or for men's sake the authors of these women

Or women's sake by whom we men are men

Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves

Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths

It is religion to be thus forsworn

For charity itself fulfills the law

And who can sever love from charity

Advance your standards and upon them lords

Pell-mell down with them But be first advised

In conflict that you get the sun of them

First from the park let us conduct them thither

Then homeward every man attach the hand

Of his fair mistress In the afternoon

We will with some strange pastime solace them

Such as the shortness of the time can shape

For revels dances masques and merry hours

Forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers

Allons Allons Sowed cockle reaped no corn

And justice always whirls in equal measure

Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn

If so our copper buys no better treasure

Their eyes villain their eyes

Once to behold rogue

Is this your perfectness Begone you rogue

Nothing but peace and gentle visitation

Tell her we measure them by weary steps

We number nothing that we spend for you

Our duty is so rich so infinite

That we may do it still without account

Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face

That we like savages may worship it

White-handed mistress one sweet word with thee

Nay then two treys an if you grow so nice

Metheglin wort and malmsey Well run dice

There's half a dozen sweets

One word in secret

Thou grievest my gall

Therefore meet

By heaven all dry-beaten with pure scoff

This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas

And utters it again when God doth please

He is wit's peddler and retails his wares

At wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs

And we that sell by gross the Lord doth know

Have not the grace to grace it with such show

This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve

Had he been Adam he had tempted Eve

He can carve too and lisp Why this is he

That kissed his hand away in courtesy

This is the ape of form Monsieur the Nice

That when he plays at tables chides the dice

In honorable terms Nay he can sing

A mean most meanly and in ushering

Mend him who can The ladies call him sweet

The stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet

This is the flower that smiles on everyone

To show his teeth as white as whale's bone

And consciences that will not die in debt

Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet

See where it comes Behavior what wert thou

Till this madman showed thee And what art thou now

This jest is dry to me Gentle sweet

Your wits makes wise things foolish When we greet

With eyes' best seeing heaven's fiery eye

By light we lose light Your capacity

Is of that nature that to your huge store

Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor

I am a fool and full of poverty

O I am yours and all that I possess

I cannot give you less

Where When What vizard Why demand you this

Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury

Can any face of brass hold longer out

Here stand I lady Dart thy skill at me

Bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout

Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance

Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit

And I will wish thee nevermore to dance

Nor nevermore in Russian habit wait

O never will I trust to speeches penned

Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue

Nor never come in vizard to my friend

Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song

Taffeta phrases silken terms precise

Three-piled hyperboles spruce affectation

Figures pedanticalthese summer flies

Have blown me full of maggot ostentation

I do forswear them and I here protest

By this white glovehow white the hand God knows

Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed

In russet yeas and honest kersey noes

And to begin Wench so God help me law

My love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw

Yet I have a trick

Of the old rage Bear with me I am sick

I'll leave it by degrees Soft let us see

Write Lord have mercy on us on those three

They are infected in their hearts it lies

They have the plague and caught it of your eyes

These lords are visited You are not free

For the Lord's tokens on you do I see

Our states are forfeit Seek not to undo us

Peace for I will not have to do with you

Speak for yourselves My wit is at an end

Neither of either I remit both twain

I see the trick on 't Here was a consent

Knowing aforehand of our merriment

To dash it like a Christmas comedy

Some carry-tale some please-man some slight zany

Some mumble-news some trencher-knight some Dick

That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick

To make my lady laugh when she's disposed

Told our intents before which once disclosed

The ladies did change favors and then we

Following the signs wooed but the sign of she

Now to our perjury to add more terror

We are again forsworn in will and error

Much upon this 'tis And might not you

Forestall our sport to make us thus untrue

Do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier

And laugh upon the apple of her eye

And stand between her back sir and the fire

Holding a trencher jesting merrily

You put our page out Go you are allowed

Die when you will a smock shall be your shroud

You leer upon me do you There's an eye

Wounds like a leaden sword

Lo he is tilting straight Peace I have done

Welcome pure wit Thou part'st a fair fray

What are there but three

And three times thrice is nine

Is not nine

By Jove I always took three threes for nine

How much is it

Art thou one of the Worthies

Go bid them prepare

We are shame-proof my lord and 'tis some policy

To have one show worse than the King's and his company

A right description of our sport my lord

Why ask you

There is five in the first show

The pedant the braggart the hedge

priest the fool and the boy

Abate throw at novum and the whole world again

Cannot pick out five such take each one in his vein

You lie you are not he

Well said old mocker I must needs be friends with thee

My hat to a halfpenny Pompey proves the

best Worthy

Your nose smells no in this most tender-smelling knight

Pompey the Great

Take away the conqueror Take away

Alisander

A kissing traitorHow art thou proved

Judas

Well followed Judas was hanged on an

elder

Because thou hast no face

A death's face in a ring

Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch

Ay and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer

And now forward for we have put thee in

countenance

False We have given thee faces

An thou wert a lion we would do so

For the ass to the Jude Give it himJud-as away

Hide thy head Achilles Here comes Hector

in arms

This cannot be Hector

A lemon

Greater than Great Great great great

Pompey Pompey the Huge

Pompey is moved More Ates more Ates

Stir them on stir them on

Ay if he have no more man's blood in his

belly than will sup a flea

What reason have you for 't

Worthies away The scene begins to cloud

Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief

And by these badges understand the King

For your fair sakes have we neglected time

Played foul play with our oaths Your beauty ladies

Hath much deformed us fashioning our humors

Even to the opposd end of our intents

And what in us hath seemed ridiculous

As love is full of unbefitting strains

All wanton as a child skipping and vain

Formed by the eye and therefore like the eye

Full of strange shapes of habits and of forms

Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll

To every varied object in his glance

Which parti-coated presence of loose love

Put on by us if in your heavenly eyes

Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities

Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults

Suggested us to make Therefore ladies

Our love being yours the error that love makes

Is likewise yours We to ourselves prove false

By being once false forever to be true

To those that make us bothfair ladies you

And even that falsehood in itself a sin

Thus purifies itself and turns to grace

Studies my lady Mistress look on me

Behold the window of my heart mine eye

What humble suit attends thy answer there

Impose some service on me for thy love

To move wild laughter in the throat of death

It cannot be it is impossible

Mirth cannot move a soul in agony

A twelvemonth Well befall what will befall

I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital

Our wooing doth not end like an old play

Jack hath not Jill These ladies' courtesy

Might well have made our sport a comedy

That's too long for a play
