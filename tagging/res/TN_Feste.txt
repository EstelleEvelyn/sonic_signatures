


Let her hang me He that is well hanged in this

world needs to fear no colors

He shall see none to fear

Where good Mistress Mary

Well God give them wisdom that have it and

those that are Fools let them use their talents

Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage

and for turning away let summer bear it out

Not so neither but I am resolved on two points

Apt in good faith very apt Well go thy way If Sir

Toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a

piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria

Wit an 't be thy will put me into good

fooling Those wits that think they have thee do very

oft prove fools and I that am sure I lack thee may

pass for a wise man For what says Quinapalus

Better a witty Fool than a foolish witGod bless

thee lady

Do you not hear fellows Take away the Lady

Two faults madonna that drink and good counsel

will amend For give the dry Fool drink then is

the Fool not dry Bid the dishonest man mend

himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if he

cannot let the botcher mend him Anything that's

mended is but patched virtue that transgresses is

but patched with sin and sin that amends is but

patched with virtue If that this simple syllogism

will serve so if it will not what remedy As there is

no true cuckold but calamity so beauty's a flower

The Lady bade take away the Fool Therefore I say

again take her away

Misprision in the highest degree Lady cucullus

non facit monachum That's as much to say as I

wear not motley in my brain Good madonna give

me leave to prove you a fool

Dexteriously good madonna

I must catechize you for it madonna Good my

mouse of virtue answer me

Good madonna why mourn'st thou

I think his soul is in hell madonna

The more fool madonna to mourn for your

brother's soul being in heaven Take away the fool

gentlemen

God send you sir a speedy infirmity for the

better increasing your folly Sir Toby will be sworn

that I am no fox but he will not pass his word for

twopence that you are no fool

Now Mercury endue thee with leasing for thou

speak'st well of Fools

Thou hast spoke for us madonna as if thy eldest

son should be a Fool whose skull Jove cram with

brains forhere he comesone of thy kin has a

most weak pia mater

Good Sir Toby

Like a drowned man a fool and a madman One

draught above heat makes him a fool the second

mads him and a third drowns him

He is but mad yet madonna and the Fool shall

look to the madman

How now my hearts Did you never see the

picture of We Three

I did impeticos thy gratillity for Malvolio's nose

is no whipstock my lady has a white hand and the

Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses

Would you have a love song or a song of good

life

O mistress mine where are you roaming

O stay and hear Your truelove's coming

That can sing both high and low

Trip no further pretty sweeting

Journeys end in lovers meeting

Every wise man's son doth know

What is love 'Tis not hereafter

Present mirth hath present laughter

What's to come is still unsure

In delay there lies no plenty

Then come kiss me sweet and twenty

Youth's a stuff will not endure

By 'r Lady sir and some dogs will catch well

Hold thy peace thou knave knight I shall be

constrained in 't to call thee knave knight

I shall never begin if I hold my peace

Beshrew me the knight's in admirable fooling

His eyes do show his days are almost done

Sir Toby there you lie

What an if you do

O no no no no you dare not

Yes by Saint Anne and ginger shall be hot i' th'

mouth too

Are you ready sir

Come away come away death

And in sad cypress let me be laid

Fly away fly away breath

I am slain by a fair cruel maid

My shroud of white stuck all with yew

O prepare it

My part of death no one so true

Did share it

Not a flower not a flower sweet

On my black coffin let there be strown

Not a friend not a friend greet

My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown

A thousand thousand sighs to save

Lay me O where

Sad true lover never find my grave

To weep there

No pains sir I take pleasure in singing sir

Truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or

another

Now the melancholy god protect thee and the

tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy

mind is a very opal I would have men of such

constancy put to sea that their business might be

everything and their intent everywhere for that's it

that always makes a good voyage of nothing

Farewell

No sir I live by the church

No such matter sir I do live by the church for I

do live at my house and my house doth stand by the

church

You have said sir To see this age A sentence is

but a chev'ril glove to a good wit How quickly the

wrong side may be turned outward

I would therefore my sister had had no name

sir

Why sir her name's a word and to dally with

that word might make my sister wanton But

indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced

them

Troth sir I can yield you none without words

and words are grown so false I am loath to prove

reason with them

Not so sir I do care for something But in my

conscience sir I do not care for you If that be to

care for nothing sir I would it would make you

invisible

No indeed sir The Lady Olivia has no folly She

will keep no Fool sir till she be married and Fools

are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings the

husband's the bigger I am indeed not her Fool but

her corrupter of words

Foolery sir does walk about the orb like the

sun it shines everywhere I would be sorry sir but

the Fool should be as oft with your master as with

my mistress I think I saw your Wisdom there

Now Jove in his next commodity of hair send

thee a beard

Would not a pair of these have bred sir

I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir to

bring a Cressida to this Troilus

The matter I hope is not great sir begging but a

beggar Cressida was a beggar My lady is within sir

I will conster to them whence you come Who you

are and what you would are out of my welkinI

might say element but the word is overworn

Will you make me believe that I am not sent for

you

Well held out i' faith No I do not know you nor

I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come

speak with her nor your name is not Master

Cesario nor this is not my nose neither Nothing

that is so is so

Vent my folly He has heard that word of some

great man and now applies it to a Fool Vent my

folly I am afraid this great lubber the world will

prove a cockney I prithee now ungird thy strangeness

and tell me what I shall vent to my lady Shall I

vent to her that thou art coming

By my troth thou hast an open hand These wise

men that give Fools money get themselves a good

reportafter fourteen years' purchase

This will I tell my lady straight I would

not be in some of your coats for twopence

Well I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in

't and I would I were the first that ever dissembled

in such a gown I am

not tall enough to become the function well nor

lean enough to be thought a good student but to be

said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as

fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar

The competitors enter

Bonos dies Sir Toby for as the old hermit of

Prague that never saw pen and ink very wittily said

to a niece of King Gorboduc That that is is so I

being Master Parson am Master Parson for what is

that but that and is but is

What ho I say Peace in this

prison

Sir Topas the curate who comes to visit Malvolio

the lunatic

Out hyperbolical fiend How vexest thou this

man Talkest thou nothing but of ladies

Fie thou dishonest Satan I call thee by the most

modest terms for I am one of those gentle ones

that will use the devil himself with courtesy Sayst

thou that house is dark

Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes

and the clerestories toward the south-north

are as lustrous as ebony and yet complainest

thou of obstruction

Madman thou errest I say there is no darkness

but ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than

the Egyptians in their fog

What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning

wildfowl

What thinkst thou of his opinion

Fare thee well Remain thou still in darkness

Thou shalt hold th' opinion of Pythagoras ere I will

allow of thy wits and fear to kill a woodcock lest

thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam Fare thee

well

Nay I am for all waters

Hey Robin jolly Robin

Tell me how thy lady does

My lady is unkind perdy

Alas why is she so

She loves another

Who calls ha

Master Malvolio

Alas sir how fell you besides your five wits

But as well Then you are mad indeed if you be

no better in your wits than a Fool

Advise you what you say The minister is here

Malvolio Malvolio thy

wits the heavens restore Endeavor thyself to sleep

and leave thy vain bibble-babble

Maintain no words with him good

fellow Who I sir Not I sir God buy

you good Sir Topas Marry amen

I will sir I will

Alas sir be patient What say you sir I am

shent for speaking to you

Welladay that you were sir

I will help you to 't But tell me true are you not

mad indeed or do you but counterfeit

Nay I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his

brains I will fetch you light and paper and ink

I am gone sir and anon sir

I'll be with you again

In a trice like to the old Vice

Your need to sustain

Who with dagger of lath in his rage and his wrath

Cries aha to the devil

Like a mad lad Pare thy nails dad

Adieu goodman devil

Good Master Fabian grant me another request

Do not desire to see this letter

Ay sir we are some of her trappings

Truly sir the better for my foes and the worse

for my friends

No sir the worse

Marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me

Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass so that by

my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself and

by my friends I am abused So that conclusions to

be as kisses if your four negatives make your two

affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and

the better for my foes

By my troth sir nothough it please you to be

one of my friends

But that it would be double-dealing sir I would

you could make it another

Put your grace in your pocket sir for this once

and let your flesh and blood obey it

Primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old

saying is the third pays for all The triplex sir is a

good tripping measure or the bells of Saint Bennet

sir may put you in mindone two three

Marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come

again I go sir but I would not have you to think

that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness

But as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I

will awake it anon

O he's drunk Sir Toby an hour agone his eyes

were set at eight i' th' morning

Truly madam he holds Beelzebub at the stave's

end as well as a man in his case may do Has here

writ a letter to you I should have given 't you today

morning But as a madman's epistles are no gospels

so it skills not much when they are delivered

Look then to be well edified when the Fool

delivers the madman By the Lord

madam

No madam I do but read madness An your

Ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must

allow vox

So I do madonna But to read his right wits is to

read thus Therefore perpend my princess and

give ear

Ay madam

Why some are born great some achieve greatness

and some have greatness thrown upon them

I was one sir in this interlude one Sir Topas sir

but that's all one By the Lord Fool I am not

madbut do you remember Madam why laugh

you at such a barren rascal an you smile not he's

gagged And thus the whirligig of time brings in

his revenges

When that I was and a little tiny boy

With hey ho the wind and the rain

A foolish thing was but a toy

For the rain it raineth every day

But when I came to man's estate

With hey ho the wind and the rain

'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate

For the rain it raineth every day

But when I came alas to wive

With hey ho the wind and the rain

By swaggering could I never thrive

For the rain it raineth every day

But when I came unto my beds

With hey ho the wind and the rain

With tosspots still had drunken heads

For the rain it raineth every day

A great while ago the world begun

With hey ho the wind and the rain

But that's all one our play is done

And we'll strive to please you every day
