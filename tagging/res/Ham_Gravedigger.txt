


Is she to be buried in Christian burial

when she willfully seeks her own salvation

How can that be unless she drowned

herself in her own defense

It must be se offendendo it cannot be

else For here lies the point if I drown myself

wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three

branchesit is to act to do to perform Argal she

drowned herself wittingly

Give me leave Here lies the water

good Here stands the man good If the man go to

this water and drown himself it is will he nill he

he goes mark you that But if the water come to him

and drown him he drowns not himself Argal he

that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his

own life

Ay marry is 'tcrowner's 'quest law

Why there thou sayst And the more

pity that great folk should have count'nance in this

world to drown or hang themselves more than

their even-Christian Come my spade There is no

ancient gentlemen but gard'ners ditchers and

grave-makers They hold up Adam's profession

He was the first that ever bore arms

What art a heathen How dost thou

understand the scripture The scripture says Adam

digged Could he dig without arms I'll put another

question to thee If thou answerest me not to the

purpose confess thyself

What is he that builds stronger than

either the mason the shipwright or the carpenter

I like thy wit well in good faith The

gallows does well But how does it well It does

well to those that do ill Now thou dost ill to say the

gallows is built stronger than the church Argal the

gallows may do well to thee To 't again come

Ay tell me that and unyoke

To 't

Cudgel thy brains no more about it

for your dull ass will not mend his pace with

beating And when you are asked this question

next say a grave-maker The houses he makes

lasts till doomsday Go get thee in and fetch me a

stoup of liquor

In youth when I did love did love

Methought it was very sweet

To contractOthe time foramy behove

O methought thereawas nothingameet

But age with his stealing steps

Hath clawed me in his clutch

And hath shipped me into the land

As if I had never been such

A pickax and a spade a spade

For and a shrouding sheet

O a pit of clay for to be made

For such a guest is meet

Mine sir

O a pit of clay for to be made

For such a guest is meet

You lie out on 't sir and therefore 'tis

not yours For my part I do not lie in 't yet it is

mine

'Tis a quick lie sir 'twill away again

from me to you

For no man sir

For none neither

One that was a woman sir but rest

her soul she's dead

Of all the days i' th' year I came to 't

that day that our last King Hamlet overcame

Fortinbras

Cannot you tell that Every fool can

tell that It was that very day that young Hamlet

was bornhe that is mad and sent into England

Why because he was mad He shall

recover his wits there Or if he do not 'tis no great

matter there

'Twill not be seen in him there There

the men are as mad as he

Very strangely they say

Faith e'en with losing his wits

Why here in Denmark I have been

sexton here man and boy thirty years

Faith if he be not rotten before he die

as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will

scarce hold the laying in he will last you some

eight year or nine year A tanner will last you nine

year

Why sir his hide is so tanned with his

trade that he will keep out water a great while and

your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead

body Here's a skull now hath lien you i' th' earth

three-and-twenty years

A whoreson mad fellow's it was

Whose do you think it was

A pestilence on him for a mad rogue

He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once

This same skull sir was sir Yorick's skull the

King's jester

E'en that
