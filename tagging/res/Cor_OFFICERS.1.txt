many stand for consulships

That's a brave fellow but he's vengeance

proud and loves not the common people

If he did not care whether he had their

love or no he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them

neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with

greater devotion than they can render it him and

leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him

their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice

and displeasure of the people is as bad as that

which he dislikes to flatter them for their love

No more of him he's a worthy man

Make way They are coming

He doth appear
