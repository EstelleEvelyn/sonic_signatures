


That is the way to make her scorn you still

I partly guess for I have loved ere now

Into a thousand that I have forgotten

Who calls

Else are they very wretched

And to you gentle sir and to you all

Fair sir I pity her

And wish for her sake more than for mine own

My fortunes were more able to relieve her

But I am shepherd to another man

And do not shear the fleeces that I graze

My master is of churlish disposition

And little recks to find the way to heaven

By doing deeds of hospitality

Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed

Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now

By reason of his absence there is nothing

That you will feed on But what is come see

And in my voice most welcome shall you be

That young swain that you saw here but erewhile

That little cares for buying anything

Assuredly the thing is to be sold

Go with me If you like upon report

The soil the profit and this kind of life

I will your very faithful feeder be

And buy it with your gold right suddenly

And how like you this shepherd's life Master

Touchstone

No more but that I know the more one sickens

the worse at ease he is and that he that wants

money means and content is without three good

friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire

to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that

a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he

that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may

complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull

kindred

No truly

Nay I hope

For not being at court Your reason

Not a whit Touchstone Those that are good

manners at the court are as ridiculous in the

country as the behavior of the country is most

mockable at the court You told me you salute not at

the court but you kiss your hands That courtesy

would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds

Why we are still handling our ewes and their

fells you know are greasy

Besides our hands are hard

And they are often tarred over with the surgery

of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The

courtier's hands are perfumed with civet

You have too courtly a wit for me I'll rest

Sir I am a true laborer I earn that I eat get that

I wear owe no man hate envy no man's happiness

glad of other men's good content with my harm

and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze

and my lambs suck

Here comes young Master Ganymede my new

mistress's brother

Mistress and master you have oft inquired

After the shepherd that complained of love

Who you saw sitting by me on the turf

Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess

That was his mistress

If you will see a pageant truly played

Between the pale complexion of true love

And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain

Go hence a little and I shall conduct you

If you will mark it

Our master and mistress seeks you Come away

away
