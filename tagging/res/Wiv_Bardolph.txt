Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman

had drunk himself out of his five sentences.

And being fap, sir, was, as

they say, cashiered. And so conclusions passed the

careers.

It is a life that I have desired. I will thrive.

Sir John, there’s one Master Brook below

would fain speak with you and be acquainted with

you, and hath sent your Worship a morning’s

draught of sack.

Ay, sir.

Here, sir.

Here’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with

you.

Come in, woman.

With eggs, sir?

Sir, the Germans desire to have three of

your horses. The Duke himself will be tomorrow at

court, and they are going to meet him.

Ay, sir. I’ll call them to you.

Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere

cozenage!

Run away with the cozeners. For so soon as

I came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind

one of them in a slough of mire, and set

spurs, and away, like three German devils, three

Doctor Faustuses.
