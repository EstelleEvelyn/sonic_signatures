


I came yonder from a great supper. The

Prince your brother is royally entertained by

Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an

intended marriage.

Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.

Even he.

Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of

Leonato.

Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was

smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and

Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference. I

whipped me behind the arras, and there heard it

agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for

himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count

Claudio.

We’ll wait upon your Lordship.

And that is Claudio. I know him by his

bearing.

So did I too, and he swore he would marry

her tonight.

Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.

Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that

no dishonesty shall appear in me.

I think I told your Lordship a year since,

how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the

waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

I can, at any unseasonable instant of the

night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber

window.

The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go

you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell

him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying

the renowned Claudio, whose estimation do you

mightily hold up, to a contaminated stale, such a

one as Hero.

Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex

Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you

for any other issue?

Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don

Pedro and the Count Claudio alone. Tell them that

you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal

both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your

brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his

friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened

with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered

thus. They will scarcely believe this without

trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less

likelihood than to see me at her chamber window,

hear me call Margaret “Hero,” hear Margaret term

me “Claudio,” and bring them to see this the very

night before the intended wedding, for in the meantime

I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be

absent, and there shall appear such seeming truth

of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called

assurance and all the preparation overthrown.

Be you constant in the accusation, and my

cunning shall not shame me.

What, Conrade!

Conrade, I say!

Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there

would a scab follow.

Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse,

for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true

drunkard, utter all to thee.

Therefore know, I have earned of Don

John a thousand ducats.

Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible

any villainy should be so rich. For when rich

villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may

make what price they will.

That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou

knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a

cloak, is nothing to a man.

I mean the fashion.

Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.

But seest thou not what a deformed thief this

fashion is?

Didst thou not hear somebody?

Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief

this fashion is, how giddily he turns about all the

hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty,

sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers

in the reechy painting, sometimes like god Bel’s

priests in the old church window, sometimes like

the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten

tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his

club?

Not so, neither. But know that I have tonight

wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman,

by the name of Hero. She leans me out at

her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand

times goodnight. I tell this tale vilely. I should first

tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master,

planted and placed and possessed by my master

Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable

amiable encounter.

Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio,

but the devil my master knew she was Margaret;

and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them,

partly by the dark night, which did deceive them,

but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any

slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio

enraged, swore he would meet her as he was

appointed next morning at the temple, and there,

before the whole congregation, shame her with

what he saw o’ernight and send her home again

without a husband.

We are like to prove a goodly

commodity, being taken up of these men’s bills.

Borachio.

Yea, sir, we hope.

Sir, I say to you we are none.

Master constable—

Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine

answer. Do you hear me, and let this count kill me.

I have deceived even your very eyes. What your

wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools

have brought to light, who in the night overheard

me confessing to this man how Don John your

brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero, how

you were brought into the orchard and saw me

court Margaret in Hero’s garments, how you disgraced

her when you should marry her. My villainy

they have upon record, which I had rather seal with

my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is

dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation.

And, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a

villain.

Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of

it.

If you would know your wronger, look on me.

Yea, even I alone.

No, by my soul, she was not,

Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,

But always hath been just and virtuous

In anything that I do know by her.
