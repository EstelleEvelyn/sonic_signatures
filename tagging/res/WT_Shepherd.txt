three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the

rest, for there is nothing in the between but getting

wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,

fighting—Hark you now. Would any but these

boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt

this weather? They have scared away two of my best

sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than

the master. If anywhere I have them, ’tis by the

seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an ’t be thy will,

what have we here? Mercy on ’s, a bairn! A very

pretty bairn. A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty

one, a very pretty one. Sure some scape. Though I

am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman

in the scape. This has been some stair-work,

some trunk-work, some behind-door work. They

were warmer that got this than the poor thing is

here. I’ll take it up for pity. Yet I’ll tarry till my son

come. He halloed but even now.—Whoa-ho-ho!

What, art so near? If thou ’lt see a thing to

talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.

What ail’st thou, man?

Why, boy, how is it?

Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Would I had been by to have helped the old

man.

Heavy matters, heavy matters. But look

thee here, boy. Now bless thyself. Thou met’st with

things dying, I with things newborn. Here’s a sight

for thee. Look thee, a bearing cloth for a squire’s

child. Look thee here. Take up, take up, boy. Open

’t. So, let’s see. It was told me I should be rich by

the fairies. This is some changeling. Open ’t. What’s

within, boy?

This is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so.

Up with ’t, keep it close. Home, home, the next way.

We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires

nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good

boy, the next way home.

That’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern

by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to

th’ sight of him.

’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good

deeds on ’t.

Fie, daughter, when my old wife lived, upon

This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,

Both dame and servant; welcomed all; served all;

Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here

At upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle;

On his shoulder, and his; her face afire

With labor, and the thing she took to quench it

She would to each one sip. You are retired

As if you were a feasted one and not

The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid

These unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is

A way to make us better friends, more known.

Come, quench your blushes and present yourself

That which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on,

And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,

As your good flock shall prosper.

They call him Doricles, and boasts himself

To have a worthy feeding. But I have it

Upon his own report, and I believe it.

He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.

I think so too, for never gazed the moon

Upon the water as he’ll stand and read,

As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain,

I think there is not half a kiss to choose

Who loves another best.

So she does anything, though I report it

That should be silent. If young Doricles

Do light upon her, she shall bring him that

Which he not dreams of.

Away! We’ll none on ’t. Here has been too

much homely foolery already.—I know, sir, we

weary you.

Leave your prating. Since these good men

are pleased, let them come in—but quickly now.

But my daughter,

Say you the like to him?

Take hands, a bargain.—

And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to ’t:

I give my daughter to him and will make

Her portion equal his.

Come, your hand—

And daughter, yours.

Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve

At knowing of thy choice.

O, my heart!

I cannot speak, nor think,

Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir,

You have undone a man of fourscore three,

That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,

To die upon the bed my father died,

To lie close by his honest bones; but now

Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me

Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursèd wretch,

That knew’st this was the Prince, and wouldst adventure

To mingle faith with him!—Undone, undone!

If I might die within this hour, I have lived

To die when I desire.

Nay, but hear me.

Go to, then.

I will tell the King all, every word, yea, and

his son’s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest

man, neither to his father nor to me, to go about to

make me the King’s brother-in-law.

Well, let us to the King. There is that in this

fardel will make him scratch his beard.

To th’ palace, an it like your Worship.

Are you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?

My business, sir, is to the King.

I know not, an ’t like you.

None, sir. I have no pheasant,

cock nor hen.

His garments are rich, but he wears them

not handsomely.

Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and

box which none must know but the King, and

which he shall know within this hour if I may come

to th’ speech of him.

Why, sir?

So ’tis said, sir—about his son, that should

have married a shepherd’s daughter.

An ’t please you, sir, to

undertake the business for us, here is that gold I

have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this

young man in pawn till I bring it you.

Ay, sir.

Let’s before, as he bids us. He was provided

to do us good.

Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy

sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.

And so have I, boy.

We may live, son, to shed many more.

Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle now

we are gentlemen.

You may say it, but not swear it.

How if it be false, son?
