


Long live Queen Margaret England's happiness

Cousin of Buckingham though Humphrey's pride

And greatness of his place be grief to us

Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal

His insolence is more intolerable

Than all the princes' in the land besides

If Gloucester be displaced he'll be Protector

If Somerset be unworthy of the place

Let York be regent I will yield to him

Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire

Have cost a mass of public treasury

I humbly thank your royal Majesty

All health unto my gracious sovereign

That all your interest in those territories

Is utterly bereft you All is lost

If York with all his far-fet policy

Had been the regent there instead of me

He never would have stayed in France so long

And in the number thee that wishest shame

Rear up his body Wring him by the nose

My lord

I'll yield myself to prison willingly

Or unto death to do my country good

O monstrous traitor I arrest thee York

Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown

Obey audacious traitor Kneel for grace
