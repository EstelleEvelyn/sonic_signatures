


Are not these large enough

It is a man's voice Gentle Isabella

Turn you the key and know his business of him

You may I may not You are yet unsworn

When you have vowed you must not speak with men

But in the presence of the Prioress

Then if you speak you must not show your face

Or if you show your face you must not speak

He calls again I pray you answer him
