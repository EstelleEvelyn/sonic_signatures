
Peace ho Caesar speaks

Bid every noise be still Peace yet again

You pulled me by the cloak Would you speak

with me

Why you were with him were you not

Why there was a crown offered him and being

offered him he put it by with the back of his hand

thus and then the people fell a-shouting

Why for that too

Why for that too

Ay marry was 't and he put it by thrice every

time gentler than other and at every putting-by

mine honest neighbors shouted

Why Antony

I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it

It was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark

Antony offer him a crown yet 'twas not a crown

neither 'twas one of these coronets and as I told

you he put it by once but for all that to my

thinking he would fain have had it Then he offered

it to him again then he put it by again but to my

thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it

And then he offered it the third time He put it the

third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement

hooted and clapped their chopped hands and

threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a

deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the

crown that it had almost choked Caesar for he

swooned and fell down at it And for mine own part

I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and

receiving the bad air

He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at

mouth and was speechless

I know not what you mean by that but I am

sure Caesar fell down If the tag-rag people did not

clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and

displeased them as they use to do the players in the

theater I am no true man

Marry before he fell down when he perceived

the common herd was glad he refused the crown

he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his

throat to cut An I had been a man of any occupation

if I would not have taken him at a word I

would I might go to hell among the rogues And so

he fell When he came to himself again he said if he

had done or said anything amiss he desired their

Worships to think it was his infirmity Three or four

wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and

forgave him with all their hearts But there's no

heed to be taken of them if Caesar had stabbed

their mothers they would have done no less

Ay

Ay he spoke Greek

Nay an I tell you that I'll ne'er look you i' th'

face again But those that understood him smiled at

one another and shook their heads But for mine

own part it was Greek to me I could tell you more

news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarves

off Caesar's images are put to silence Fare you

well There was more foolery yet if I could remember

it

No I am promised forth

Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your

dinner worth the eating

Do so Farewell both

Are not you moved when all the sway of earth

Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero

I have seen tempests when the scolding winds

Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen

Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam

To be exalted with the threat'ning clouds

But never till tonight never till now

Did I go through a tempest dropping fire

Either there is a civil strife in heaven

Or else the world too saucy with the gods

Incenses them to send destruction

A common slave you know him well by sight

Held up his left hand which did flame and burn

Like twenty torches joined and yet his hand

Not sensible of fire remained unscorched

Besides I ha' not since put up my sword

Against the Capitol I met a lion

Who glazed upon me and went surly by

Without annoying me And there were drawn

Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women

Transformd with their fear who swore they saw

Men all in fire walk up and down the streets

And yesterday the bird of night did sit

Even at noonday upon the marketplace

Hooting and shrieking When these prodigies

Do so conjointly meet let not men say

These are their reasons they are natural

For I believe they are portentous things

Unto the climate that they point upon

He doth for he did bid Antonius

Send word to you he would be there tomorrow

Farewell Cicero

A Roman

Your ear is good Cassius what night is this

Who ever knew the heavens menace so

But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens

It is the part of men to fear and tremble

When the most mighty gods by tokens send

Such dreadful heralds to astonish us

'Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius

Indeed they say the Senators tomorrow

Mean to establish Caesar as a king

And he shall wear his crown by sea and land

In every place save here in Italy

So can I

So every bondman in his own hand bears

The power to cancel his captivity

You speak to Casca and to such a man

That is no fleering telltale Hold My hand

Be factious for redress of all these griefs

And I will set this foot of mine as far

As who goes farthest

Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste

O he sits high in all the people's hearts

And that which would appear offense in us

His countenance like richest alchemy

Will change to virtue and to worthiness

No

You shall confess that you are both deceived

Here as I point my sword the sun arises

Which is a great way growing on the south

Weighing the youthful season of the year

Some two months hence up higher toward the north

He first presents his fire and the high east

Stands as the Capitol directly here

Let us not leave him out

Indeed he is not fit

Speak hands for me

Go to the pulpit Brutus

Why he that cuts off twenty years of life

Cuts off so many years of fearing death
