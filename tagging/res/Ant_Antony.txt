There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned

Then must thou needs find out new heaven new Earth

Grates me the sum

How my love

Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch

Of the ranged empire fall Here is my space

Kingdoms are clay Our dungy earth alike

Feeds beast as man The nobleness of life

Is to do thus when such a mutual pair

And such a twain can do 't in which I bind

On pain of punishment the world to weet

We stand up peerless

But stirred by Cleopatra

Now for the love of Love and her soft hours

Let's not confound the time with conference harsh

There's not a minute of our lives should stretch

Without some pleasure now What sport tonight

Fie wrangling queen

Whom everything becomesto chide to laugh

To weep whose every passion fully strives

To make itself in thee fair and admired

No messenger but thine and all alone

Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note

The qualities of people Come my queen

Last night you did desire it Speak not to us

Against my brother Lucius

Well what worst

When it concerns the fool or coward On

Things that are past are done with me 'Tis thus

Who tells me true though in his tale lie death

I hear him as he flattered

Antony thou wouldst say

Speak to me home mince not the general tongue

Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome

Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults

With such full license as both truth and malice

Have power to utter O then we bring forth weeds

When our quick winds lie still and our ills told us

Is as our earing Fare thee well awhile

From Sicyon how the news Speak there

Is there such an one

Let him appear

These strong Egyptian fetters I must break

Or lose myself in dotage    What are you

Where died she

Forbear me

There's a great spirit gone Thus did I desire it

What our contempts doth often hurl from us

We wish it ours again The present pleasure

By revolution lowering does become

The opposite of itself She's good being gone

The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on

I must from this enchanting queen break off

Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know

My idleness doth hatchHow now Enobarbus

I must with haste from hence

I must be gone

She is cunning past man's thought

Would I had never seen her

Fulvia is dead

Fulvia is dead

Dead

The business she hath broachd in the state

Cannot endure my absence

No more light answers Let our officers

Have notice what we purpose I shall break

The cause of our expedience to the Queen

And get her leave to part For not alone

The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches

Do strongly speak to us but the letters too

Of many our contriving friends in Rome

Petition us at home Sextus Pompeius

Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands

The empire of the sea Our slippery people

Whose love is never linked to the deserver

Till his deserts are past begin to throw

Pompey the Great and all his dignities

Upon his son whohigh in name and power

Higher than both in blood and lifestands up

For the main soldier whose quality going on

The sides o' th' world may danger Much is breeding

Which like the courser's hair hath yet but life

And not a serpent's poison Say our pleasure

To such whose place is under us requires

Our quick remove from hence

I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose

Now my dearest queen

What's the matter

The gods best know

Cleopatra

Most sweet queen

How now lady

Hear me queen

The strong necessity of time commands

Our services awhile but my full heart

Remains in use with you Our Italy

Shines o'er with civil swords Sextus Pompeius

Makes his approaches to the port of Rome

Equality of two domestic powers

Breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength

Are newly grown to love the condemned Pompey

Rich in his father's honor creeps apace

Into the hearts of such as have not thrived

Upon the present state whose numbers threaten

And quietness grown sick of rest would purge

By any desperate change My more particular

And that which most with you should safe my going

Is Fulvia's death

She's dead my queen

Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read

The garboils she awaked at the last best

See when and where she died

Quarrel no more but be prepared to know

The purposes I bear which are or cease

As you shall give th' advice By the fire

That quickens Nilus' slime I go from hence

Thy soldier servant making peace or war

As thou affects

My precious queen forbear

And give true evidence to his love which stands

An honorable trial

You'll heat my blood No more

Now by my sword

I'll leave you lady

But that your Royalty

Holds idleness your subject I should take you

For idleness itself

Let us go Come

Our separation so abides and flies

That thou residing here goes yet with me

And I hence fleeting here remain with thee

Away

If we compose well here to Parthia

Hark Ventidius

'Tis spoken well

Were we before our armies and to fight

I should do thus

Thank you

Sit sir

I learn you take things ill which are not so

Or being concern you not

My being in Egypt Caesar what was 't to you

How intend you practiced

You do mistake your business My brother never

Did urge me in his act I did inquire it

And have my learning from some true reports

That drew their swords with you Did he not rather

Discredit my authority with yours

And make the wars alike against my stomach

Having alike your cause Of this my letters

Before did satisfy you If you'll patch a quarrel

As matter whole you have to make it with

It must not be with this

Not so not so

I know you could not lackI am certain on 't

Very necessity of this thought that I

Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought

Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars

Which fronted mine own peace As for my wife

I would you had her spirit in such another

The third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle

You may pace easy but not such a wife

So much uncurbable her garboils Caesar

Made out of her impatiencewhich not wanted

Shrewdness of policy tooI grieving grant

Did you too much disquiet For that you must

But say I could not help it

Sir

He fell upon me ere admitted then

Three kings I had newly feasted and did want

Of what I was i' th' morning But next day

I told him of myself which was as much

As to have asked him pardon Let this fellow

Be nothing of our strife if we contend

Out of our question wipe him

No Lepidus let him speak

The honor is sacred which he talks on now

Supposing that I lacked itBut on Caesar

The article of my oath

Neglected rather

And then when poisoned hours had bound me up

From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may

I'll play the penitent to you But mine honesty

Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power

Work without it Truth is that Fulvia

To have me out of Egypt made wars here

For which myself the ignorant motive do

So far ask pardon as befits mine honor

To stoop in such a case

Thou art a soldier only Speak no more

You wrong this presence therefore speak no more

I am not married Caesar Let me hear

Agrippa further speak

Will Caesar speak

What power is in Agrippa

If I would say Agrippa be it so

To make this good

May I never

To this good purpose that so fairly shows

Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand

Further this act of grace and from this hour

The heart of brothers govern in our loves

And sway our great designs

I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey

For he hath laid strange courtesies and great

Of late upon me I must thank him only

Lest my remembrance suffer ill report

At heel of that defy him

Where lies he

What is his strength by land

So is the fame

Would we had spoke together Haste we for it

Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we

The business we have talked of

Let us Lepidus not lack your company

The world and my great office will sometimes

Divide me from your bosom

Goodnight sirMy Octavia

Read not my blemishes in the world's report

I have not kept my square but that to come

Shall all be done by th' rule Good night dear lady

Good night sir

Now sirrah you do wish yourself in Egypt

If you can your reason

Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher

Caesar's or mine

Speak this no more

Get thee gone

Say to Ventidius I would speak with him

He shall to Parthia Be it art or hap

He hath spoken true The very dice obey him

And in our sports my better cunning faints

Under his chance If we draw lots he speeds

His cocks do win the battle still of mine

When it is all to naught and his quails ever

Beat mine inhooped at odds I will to Egypt

And though I make this marriage for my peace

I' th' East my pleasure lies    O come Ventidius

You must to Parthia your commission's ready

Follow me and receive 't

Thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails

We'll speak with thee at sea At land thou know'st

How much we do o'ercount thee

Which do not be entreated to but weigh

What it is worth embraced

That's our offer

I have heard it Pompey

And am well studied for a liberal thanks

Which I do owe you

The beds i' th' East are soft and thanks to you

That called me timelier than my purpose hither

For I have gained by 't

That will I Pompey

You have heard much

And fair words to them

Show 's the way sir

Thus do they sir they take the flow o' th' Nile

By certain scales i' th' Pyramid they know

By th' height the lowness or the mean if dearth

Or foison follow The higher Nilus swells

The more it promises As it ebbs the seedsman

Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain

And shortly comes to harvest

Ay Lepidus

They are so

It is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as

it hath breadth It is just so high as it is and moves

with it own organs It lives by that which nourisheth

it and the elements once out of it it

transmigrates

Of it own color too

'Tis so and the tears of it are wet

With the health that Pompey gives him else he

is a very epicure

These quicksands Lepidus

Keep off them for you sink

Bear him ashoreI'll pledge it for him Pompey

It ripens towards it Strike the vessels ho

Here's to Caesar

Be a child o' th' time

Come let's all take hands

Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense

In soft and delicate Lethe

Cup us till the world go round

Cup us till the world go round

And shall sir Give 's your hand

No further sir

Make me not offended

In your distrust

You shall not find

Though you be therein curious the least cause

For what you seem to fear So the gods keep you

And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends

We will here part

The April's in her eyes It is love's spring

And these the showers to bring it onBe cheerful

Her tongue will not obey her heart nor can

Her heart inform her tonguethe swan's-down feather

That stands upon the swell at the full of tide

And neither way inclines

Come sir come

I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love

Look here I have you thus I let you go

And give you to the gods

Farewell

Nay nay Octavia not only that

That were excusable that and thousands more

Of semblable importbut he hath waged

New wars 'gainst Pompey made his will and read it

To public ear

Spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not

But pay me terms of honor cold and sickly

He vented them most narrow measure lent me

When the best hint was given him he not took 't

Or did it from his teeth

Gentle Octavia

Let your best love draw to that point which seeks

Best to preserve it If I lose mine honor

I lose myself better I were not yours

Than yours so branchless But as you requested

Yourself shall go between 's The meantime lady

I'll raise the preparation of a war

Shall stain your brother Make your soonest haste

So your desires are yours

When it appears to you where this begins

Turn your displeasure that way for our faults

Can never be so equal that your love

Can equally move with them Provide your going

Choose your own company and command what cost

Your heart has mind to

Is it not strange Canidius

That from Tarentum and Brundusium

He could so quickly cut the Ionian Sea

And take in ToryneYou have heard on 't sweet

A good rebuke

Which might have well becomed the best of men

To taunt at slacknessCanidius we will fight

With him by sea

For that he dares us to 't

By sea by sea

I'll fight at sea

Our overplus of shipping will we burn

And with the rest full-manned from th' head of Actium

Beat th' approaching Caesar But if we fail

We then can do 't at land    Thy business

Can he be there in person 'Tis impossible

Strange that his power should be Canidius

Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land

And our twelve thousand horse We'll to our ship

Away my Thetis    How now worthy soldier

Well well away

Set we our squadrons on yond side o' th' hill

In eye of Caesar's battle from which place

We may the number of the ships behold

And so proceed accordingly

Hark the land bids me tread no more upon 't

It is ashamed to bear me Friends come hither

I am so lated in the world that I

Have lost my way forever I have a ship

Laden with gold Take that divide it Fly

And make your peace with Caesar

I have fled myself and have instructed cowards

To run and show their shoulders Friends begone

I have myself resolved upon a course

Which has no need of you Begone

My treasure's in the harbor take it O

I followed that I blush to look upon

My very hairs do mutiny for the white

Reprove the brown for rashness and they them

For fear and doting Friends begone You shall

Have letters from me to some friends that will

Sweep your way for you Pray you look not sad

Nor make replies of loathness Take the hint

Which my despair proclaims Let that be left

Which leaves itself To the seaside straightway

I will possess you of that ship and treasure

Leave me I pray a littlepray you now

Nay do sofor indeed I have lost command

Therefore I pray youI'll see you by and by

No no no no no

Oh fie fie fie

Yes my lord yes He at Philippi kept

His sword e'en like a dancer while I struck

The lean and wrinkled Cassius and 'twas I

That the mad Brutus ended He alone

Dealt on lieutenantry and no practice had

In the brave squares of war yet nowno matter

I have offended reputation

A most unnoble swerving

O whither hast them led me Egypt See

How I convey my shame out of thine eyes

By looking back what I have left behind

'Stroyed in dishonor

Egypt thou knew'st too well

My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings

And thou shouldst tow me after O'er my spirit

Thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that

Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods

Command me

Now I must

To the young man send humble treaties dodge

And palter in the shifts of lowness who

With half the bulk o' th' world played as I pleased

Making and marring fortunes You did know

How much you were my conqueror and that

My sword made weak by my affection would

Obey it on all cause

Fall not a tear I say one of them rates

All that is won and lost Give me a kiss

Even this repays me

We sent our schoolmaster Is he come back

Love I am full of leadSome wine

Within there and our viands Fortune knows

We scorn her most when most she offers blows

Is that his answer

The Queen shall then have courtesy so she

Will yield us up

Let her know 't

To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head

And he will fill thy wishes to the brim

With principalities

To him again Tell him he wears the rose

Of youth upon him from which the world should note

Something particular his coin ships legions

May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail

Under the service of a child as soon

As i' th' command of Caesar I dare him therefore

To lay his gay caparisons apart

And answer me declined sword against sword

Ourselves alone I'll write it Follow me

Favors By Jove that thunders

What art thou fellow

Approach thereAh you kiteNow gods and devils

Authority melts from me Of late when I cried Ho

Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth

And cry Your will Have you no ears I am

Antony yet    Take hence this jack and whip him

Moon and stars

Whip him Were 't twenty of the greatest tributaries

That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them

So saucy with the hand of she herewhat's her name

Since she was Cleopatra Whip him fellows

Till like a boy you see him cringe his face

And whine aloud for mercy Take him hence

Tug him away Being whipped

Bring him again This jack of Caesar's shall

Bear us an errand to him

You were half blasted ere I knew you Ha

Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome

Forborne the getting of a lawful race

And by a gem of women to be abused

By one that looks on feeders

You have been a boggler ever

But when we in our viciousness grow hard

O misery on 'tthe wise gods seel our eyes

In our own filth drop our clear judgments make us

Adore our errors laugh at 's while we strut

To our confusion

I found you as a morsel cold upon

Dead Caesar's trencher nay you were a fragment

Of Gneius Pompey's besides what hotter hours

Unregistered in vulgar fame you have

Luxuriously picked out For I am sure

Though you can guess what temperance should be

You know not what it is

To let a fellow that will take rewards

And say God quit you be familiar with

My playfellow your hand this kingly seal

And plighter of high hearts O that I were

Upon the hill of Basan to outroar

The hornd herd For I have savage cause

And to proclaim it civilly were like

A haltered neck which does the hangman thank

For being yare about him    Is he whipped

Cried he And begged he pardon

If that thy father live let him repent

Thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry

To follow Caesar in his triumph since

Thou hast been whipped for following him Henceforth

The white hand of a lady fever thee

Shake thou to look on 't Get thee back to Caesar

Tell him thy entertainment Look thou say

He makes me angry with him for he seems

Proud and disdainful harping on what I am

Not what he knew I was He makes me angry

And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't

When my good stars that were my former guides

Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires

Into th' abysm of hell If he mislike

My speech and what is done tell him he has

Hipparchus my enfranchd bondman whom

He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture

As he shall like to quit me Urge it thou

Hence with thy stripes begone

Alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed

And it portends alone the fall of Antony

To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes

With one that ties his points

Coldhearted toward me

I am satisfied

Caesar sits down in Alexandria where

I will oppose his fate Our force by land

Hath nobly held our severed navy too

Have knit again and fleet threatening most sealike

Where hast thou been my heart Dost thou hear lady

If from the field I shall return once more

To kiss these lips I will appear in blood

I and my sword will earn our chronicle

There's hope in 't yet

I will be treble-sinewed -hearted -breathed

And fight maliciously for when mine hours

Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives

Of me for jests But now I'll set my teeth

And send to darkness all that stop me Come

Let's have one other gaudy night Call to me

All my sad captains Fill our bowls once more

Let's mock the midnight bell

We will yet do well

Do so we'll speak to them and tonight I'll force

The wine peep through their scarsCome on my queen

There's sap in 't yet The next time I do fight

I'll make Death love me for I will contend

Even with his pestilent scythe

He will not fight with me Domitius

Why should he not

Tomorrow soldier

By sea and land I'll fight Or I will live

Or bathe my dying honor in the blood

Shall make it live again Woo't thou fight well

Well said Come on

Call forth my household servants    Let's tonight

Be bounteous at our mealGive me thy hand

Thou hast been rightly honestSo hast thou

Thouand thouand thou You have served me well

And kings have been your fellows

And thou art honest too

I wish I could be made so many men

And all of you clapped up together in

An Antony that I might do you service

So good as you have done

Well my good fellows wait on me tonight

Scant not my cups and make as much of me

As when mine empire was your fellow too

And suffered my command

Tend me tonight

May be it is the period of your duty

Haply you shall not see me more or if

A mangled shadow Perchance tomorrow

You'll serve another master I look on you

As one that takes his leave Mine honest friends

I turn you not away but like a master

Married to your good service stay till death

Tend me tonight two hoursI ask no more

And the gods yield you for 't

Ho ho ho

Now the witch take me if I meant it thus

Grace grow where those drops fall My hearty friends

You take me in too dolorous a sense

For I spake to you for your comfort did desire you

To burn this night with torches Know my hearts

I hope well of tomorrow and will lead you

Where rather I'll expect victorious life

Than death and honor Let's to supper come

And drown consideration

Eros Mine armor Eros

No my chuckEros come mine armor Eros

Come good fellow put thine iron on

If fortune be not ours today it is

Because we brave her Come

Ah let be let be Thou art

The armorer of my heart False false This this

Well well

We shall thrive nowSeest thou my good fellow

Go put on thy defenses

Rarely rarely

He that unbuckles this till we do please

To daff 't for our repose shall hear a storm

Thou fumblest Eros and my queen's a squire

More tight at this than thou DispatchO love

That thou couldst see my wars today and knew'st

The royal occupation thou shouldst see

A workman in 't    Good morrow to thee Welcome

Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge

To business that we love we rise betime

And go to 't with delight

'Tis well blown lads

This morning like the spirit of a youth

That means to be of note begins betimes

So soCome give me that This wayWell said

Fare thee well dame Whate'er becomes of me

This is a soldier's kiss Rebukable

And worthy shameful check it were to stand

On more mechanic compliment I'll leave thee

Now like a man of steelYou that will fight

Follow me close I'll bring you to 'tAdieu

Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed

To make me fight at land

Who's gone this morning

What sayest thou

Is he gone

Go Eros send his treasure after Do it

Detain no jot I charge thee Write to him

I will subscribegentle adieus and greetings

Say that I wish he never find more cause

To change a master O my fortunes have

Corrupted honest men DispatchEnobarbus

Thou bleed'st apace

They do retire

I will reward thee

Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold

For thy good valor Come thee on

We have beat him to his camp Run one before

And let the Queen know of our gests  Tomorrow

Before the sun shall see 's we'll spill the blood

That has today escaped I thank you all

For doughty-handed are you and have fought

Not as you served the cause but as 't had been

Each man's like mine You have shown all Hectors

Enter the city Clip your wives your friends

Tell them your feats whilst they with joyful tears

Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss

The honored gashes whole    Give me thy hand

To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts

Make her thanks bless theeO thou day o' th' world

Chain mine armed neck Leap thou attire and all

Through proof of harness to my heart and there

Ride on the pants triumphing

Mine nightingale

We have beat them to their beds What girl though gray

Do something mingle with our younger brown yet ha' we

A brain that nourishes our nerves and can

Get goal for goal of youth Behold this man

Commend unto his lips thy favoring hand

Kiss it my warrior He hath fought today

As if a god in hate of mankind had

Destroyed in such a shape

He has deserved it were it carbuncled

Like holy Phoebus' car Give me thy hand

Through Alexandria make a jolly march

Bear our hacked targets like the men that owe them

Had our great palace the capacity

To camp this host we all would sup together

And drink carouses to the next day's fate

Which promises royal perilTrumpeters

With brazen din blast you the city's ear

Make mingle with our rattling taborins

That heaven and Earth may strike their sounds together

Applauding our approach

Their preparation is today by sea

We please them not by land

I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air

We'd fight there too But this it is our foot

Upon the hills adjoining to the city

Shall stay with usorder for sea is given

They have put forth the haven

Where their appointment we may best discover

And look on their endeavor

Yet they are not joined Where yond pine does stand

I shall discover all I'll bring thee word

Straight how 'tis like to go

All is lost

This foul Egyptian hath betrayd me

My fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder

They cast their caps up and carouse together

Like friends long lost Triple-turned whore 'Tis thou

Hast sold me to this novice and my heart

Makes only wars on thee Bid them all fly

For when I am revenged upon my charm

I have done all Bid them all fly Begone

O sun thy uprise shall I see no more

Fortune and Antony part here even here

Do we shake hands All come to this The hearts

That spanieled me at heels to whom I gave

Their wishes do discandy melt their sweets

On blossoming Caesar and this pine is barked

That overtopped them all Betrayed I am

O this false soul of Egypt This grave charm

Whose eye becked forth my wars and called them home

Whose bosom was my crownet my chief end

Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose

Beguiled me to the very heart of loss

What Eros Eros    Ah thou spell Avaunt

Vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving

And blemish Caesar's triumph Let him take thee

And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians

Follow his chariot like the greatest spot

Of all thy sex most monster-like be shown

For poor'st diminutives for dolts and let

Patient Octavia plow thy visage up

With her prepard nails 'Tis well th' art gone

If it be well to live But better 'twere

Thou fell'st into my fury for one death

Might have prevented manyEros ho

The shirt of Nessus is upon me Teach me

Alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage

Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon

And with those hands that grasped the heaviest club

Subdue my worthiest self The witch shall die

To the young Roman boy she hath sold me and I fall

Under this plot She dies for 'tEros ho

Eros thou yet behold'st me

Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish

A vapor sometime like a bear or lion

A towered citadel a pendent rock

A forkd mountain or blue promontory

With trees upon 't that nod unto the world

And mock our eyes with air Thou hast seen these signs

They are black vesper's pageants

That which is now a horse even with a thought

The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct

As water is in water

My good knave Eros now thy captain is

Even such a body Here I am Antony

Yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave

I made these wars for Egypt and the Queen

Whose heart I thought I had for she had mine

Which whilst it was mine had annexed unto 't

A million more now lostshe Eros has

Packed cards with Caesar and false-played my glory

Unto an enemy's triumph

Nay weep not gentle Eros There is left us

Ourselves to end ourselves    O thy vile lady

She has robbed me of my sword

Hence saucy eunuch Peace

She hath betrayed me and shall die the death

Dead then

Unarm Eros The long day's task is done

And we must sleepThat thou depart'st hence safe

Does pay thy labor richly Go Off pluck off

The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep

The battery from my heart O cleave my sides

Heart once be stronger than thy continent

Crack thy frail case Apace Eros apace

No more a soldier Bruisd pieces go

You have been nobly borneFrom me awhile

I will o'ertake thee Cleopatra and

Weep for my pardon So it must be for now

All length is torture Since the torch is out

Lie down and stray no farther Now all labor

Mars what it does yea very force entangles

Itself with strength Seal then and all is done

ErosI come my queenErosStay for me

Where souls do couch on flowers we'll hand in hand

And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze

Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops

And all the haunt be oursCome Eros Eros

Since Cleopatra died

I have lived in such dishonor that the gods

Detest my baseness I that with my sword

Quartered the world and o'er green Neptune's back

With ships made cities condemn myself to lack

The courage of a womanless noble mind

Than she which by her death our Caesar tells

I am conqueror of myself Thou art sworn Eros

That when the exigent should come which now

Is come indeed when I should see behind me

Th' inevitable prosecution of

Disgrace and horror that on my command

Thou then wouldst kill me Do 't The time is come

Thou strik'st not me 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st

Put color in thy cheek

Eros

Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see

Thy master thus with pleached arms bending down

His corrigible neck his face subdued

To penetrative shame whilst the wheeled seat

Of fortunate Caesar drawn before him branded

His baseness that ensued

Come then for with a wound I must be cured

Draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn

Most useful for thy country

When I did make thee free swor'st thou not then

To do this when I bade thee Do it at once

Or thy precedent services are all

But accidents unpurposed Draw and come

Lo thee

Then let it do at once

The thing why thou hast drawn it

'Tis said man and farewell

Now Eros

Thrice nobler than myself

Thou teachest me O valiant Eros what

I should and thou couldst not My queen and Eros

Have by their brave instruction got upon me

A nobleness in record But I will be

A bridegroom in my death and run into 't

As to a lover's bed Come then and Eros

Thy master dies thy scholar To do thus

I learned of thee How not dead Not dead

The guard ho O dispatch me

I have done my work ill friends O make an end

Of what I have begun

Let him that loves me strike me dead

Art thou there Diomed Draw thy sword and give me

Sufficing strokes for death

When did she send thee

Where is she

Too late good Diomed Call my guard I prithee

Bear me good friends where Cleopatra bides

'Tis the last service that I shall command you

Nay good my fellows do not please sharp fate

To grace it with your sorrows Bid that welcome

Which comes to punish us and we punish it

Seeming to bear it lightly Take me up

I have led you oft carry me now good friends

And have my thanks for all

Peace

Not Caesar's valor hath o'erthrown Antony

But Antony's hath triumphed on itself

I am dying Egypt dying Only

I here importune death awhile until

Of many thousand kisses the poor last

I lay upon thy lips

O quick or I am gone

I am dying Egypt dying

Give me some wine and let me speak a little

One word sweet queen

Of Caesar seek your honor with your safetyO

Gentle hear me

None about Caesar trust but Proculeius

The miserable change now at my end

Lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts

In feeding them with those my former fortunes

Wherein I lived the greatest prince o' th' world

The noblest and do now not basely die

Not cowardly put off my helmet to

My countrymana Roman by a Roman

Valiantly vanquished Now my spirit is going

I can no more
