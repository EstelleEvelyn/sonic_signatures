but, as you would say, a cobbler.

A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe

conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad

soles.

Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.

Yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

Why, sir, cobble you.

Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the

awl. I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor

women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a

surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger,

I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon

neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.

Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to

get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we

make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his

triumph.
