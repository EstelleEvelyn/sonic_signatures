


God save you worthy general

The Duke and the Senators of Venice greet you

I thank you How does Lieutenant Cassio

He did not call he's busy in the paper

Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio

May be the letter moved him

For as I think they do command him home

Deputing Cassio in his government

My lord this would not be believed in Venice

Though I should swear I saw 't 'Tis very much

Make her amends She weeps

Truly an obedient lady

I do beseech your Lordship call her back

Who I my lord

Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate

Call all in all sufficient Is this the nature

Whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue

The shot of accident nor dart of chance

Could neither graze nor pierce

Are his wits safe Is he not light of brain

What Strike his wife

Is it his use

Or did the letters work upon his blood

And new-create this fault

I am sorry that I am deceived in him

I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further

Madam good night I humbly thank your Ladyship

Hark

Two or three groan 'Tis heavy night

These may be counterfeits Let's think 't unsafe

To come in to the cry without more help

Hark

We do not know

The same indeed a very valiant fellow

As you shall prove us praise us

He sir

Where is this rash and most unfortunate man

Where is that viper Bring the villain forth

Wrench his sword from him

O thou Othello that wert once so good

Fall'n in the practice of a damnd slave

What shall be said to thee

This wretch hath part confessed his villainy

Did you and he consent in Cassio's death

What Not to pray

Sir

You shall understand what hath befall'n

Which as I think you know not Here is a letter

Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo

And here another The one of them imports

The death of Cassio to be undertook

By Roderigo

Now here's another discontented paper

Found in his pocket too and this it seems

Roderigo meant t' have sent this damnd villain

But that belike Iago in the interim

Came in and satisfied him

You must forsake this room and go with us

Your power and your command is taken off

And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave

If there be any cunning cruelty

That can torment him much and hold him long

It shall be his You shall close prisoner rest

Till that the nature of your fault be known

To the Venetian stateCome bring away

O bloody period

O Spartan dog

More fell than anguish hunger or the sea

Look on the tragic loading of this bed

This is thy workThe object poisons sight

Let it be hidGratiano keep the house

And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor

For they succeed on you To you lord governor

Remains the censure of this hellish villain

The time the place the torture O enforce it

Myself will straight aboard and to the state

This heavy act with heavy heart relate
