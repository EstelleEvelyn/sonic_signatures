


A strange beginning borrowed majesty

What now my son Have I not ever said

How that ambitious Constance would not cease

Till she had kindled France and all the world

Upon the right and party of her son

This might have been prevented and made whole

With very easy arguments of love

Which now the manage of two kingdoms must

With fearful bloody issue arbitrate

Your strong possession much more than your right

Or else it must go wrong with you and me

So much my conscience whispers in your ear

Which none but God and you and I shall hear

Out on thee rude man Thou dost shame thy mother

And wound her honor with this diffidence

He hath a trick of Coeur de Lion's face

The accent of his tongue affecteth him

Do you not read some tokens of my son

In the large composition of this man

Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge

And like thy brother to enjoy thy land

Or the reputed son of Coeur de Lion

Lord of thy presence and no land besides

I like thee well Wilt thou forsake thy fortune

Bequeath thy land to him and follow me

I am a soldier and now bound to France

Nay I would have you go before me thither

The very spirit of Plantagenet

I am thy grandam Richard Call me so

Who is it thou dost call usurper France

Out insolent Thy bastard shall be king

That thou mayst be a queen and check the world

There's a good mother boy that blots thy father

Come to thy grandam child

His mother shames him so poor boy he weeps

Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and Earth

Thou unadvisd scold I can produce

A will that bars the title of thy son

Son list to this conjunction make this match

Give with our niece a dowry large enough

For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie

Thy now unsured assurance to the crown

That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe

The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit

I see a yielding in the looks of France

Mark how they whisper Urge them while their souls

Are capable of this ambition

Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath

Of soft petitions pity and remorse

Cool and congeal again to what it was

Look'st thou pale France Do not let go thy hand

O foul revolt of French inconstancy

Farewell gentle cousin

Come hither little kinsman Hark a word

My blessing go with thee
