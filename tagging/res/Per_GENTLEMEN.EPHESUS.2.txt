


Good morrow to your Lordship

That is the cause we trouble you so early

'Tis not our husbandry

Your Honor has through Ephesus poured forth

Your charity and hundreds call themselves

Your creatures who by you have been restored

And not your knowledge your personal pain but even

Your purse still open hath built Lord Cerimon

Such strong renown as time shall never

'Tis like a coffin sir

'Tis so my lord

A delicate odor

Most strange

Most likely sir

Is not this strange
