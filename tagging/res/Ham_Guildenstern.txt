
But we both obey

And here give up ourselves in the full bent

To lay our service freely at your feet

To be commanded

Heavens make our presence and our practices

Pleasant and helpful to him

My honored lord

Happy in that we are not overhappy

On Fortune's cap we are not the very button

Faith her privates we

Prison my lord

Which dreams indeed are ambition

for the very substance of the ambitious is merely

the shadow of a dream

We'll wait upon you

What should we say my lord

My lord we were sent for

O there has been much throwing

about of brains

There are the players

In what my dear lord

Nor do we find him forward to be sounded

But with a crafty madness keeps aloof

When we would bring him on to some confession

Of his true state

But with much forcing of his disposition

Good my lord vouchsafe me a word

with you

The King sir

Is in his retirement marvelous

distempered

No my lord with choler

Good my lord put your discourse into

some frame and start not so wildly from my

affair

The Queen your mother in most great

affliction of spirit hath sent me to you

Nay good my lord this courtesy is not

of the right breed If it shall please you to make me

a wholesome answer I will do your mother's

commandment If not your pardon and my return

shall be the end of my business

O my lord if my duty be too bold my

love is too unmannerly

My lord I cannot

Believe me I cannot

I know no touch of it my lord

But these cannot I command to any

utt'rance of harmony I have not the skill

We will ourselves provide

Most holy and religious fear it is

To keep those many many bodies safe

That live and feed upon your Majesty

A thing my lord
