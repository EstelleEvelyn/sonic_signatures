Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them

Even to their ships.

By his great authority,

Which often hath no less prevailed than so

On your command.

Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.

For her, my lord,

I dare my life lay down—and will do ’t, sir,

Please you t’ accept it—that the Queen is spotless

I’ th’ eyes of heaven, and to you—I mean

In this which you accuse her.

Good my lord—

I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,

Upon this ground. And more it would content me

To have her honor true than your suspicion,

Be blamed for ’t how you might.

Well done, my lord.

You must not enter.

We can, my royal liege.

He is not guilty of her coming hither.

Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.

We have always truly served you, and beseech

So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,

As recompense of our dear services

Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,

Which being so horrible, so bloody, must

Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.

So please you, sir, their speed

Hath been beyond account.

This your request

Is altogether just. Therefore bring forth,

And in Apollo’s name, his oracle.

Now blessèd be the great Apollo!

What fit is this, good lady?

The higher powers forbid!

Say no more.

Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault

I’ th’ boldness of your speech.
