Madam the care I have had to even your

content I wish might be found in the calendar of

my past endeavors for then we wound our modesty

and make foul the clearness of our deservings

when of ourselves we publish them

May it please you madam that he bid Helen

come to you Of her I am to speak

I know madam you love your gentlewoman

entirely

Madam I was very late more near her than I

think she wished me Alone she was and did communicate

to herself her own words to her own

ears she thought I dare vow for her they touched

not any stranger sense Her matter was she loved

your son Fortune she said was no goddess that

had put such difference betwixt their two estates

Love no god that would not extend his might only

where qualities were level Dian no queen of virgins

that would suffer her poor knight surprised

without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward

This she delivered in the most bitter touch

of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in which

I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal

sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns

you something to know it

I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim thither gone

Ambitious love hath so in me offended

That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon

With sainted vow my faults to have amended

Write write that from the bloody course of war

My dearest master your dear son may hie

Bless him at home in peace whilst I from far

His name with zealous fervor sanctify

His taken labors bid him me forgive

I his despiteful Juno sent him forth

From courtly friends with camping foes to live

Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth

He is too good and fair for death and me

Whom I myself embrace to set him free

Pardon me madam

If I had given you this at overnight

She might have been o'erta'en And yet she writes

Pursuit would be but vain
