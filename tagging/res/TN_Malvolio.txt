


Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death

shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth

ever make the better Fool.

I marvel your Ladyship takes delight in

such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other

day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain

than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard

already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to

him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men

that crow so at these set kind of Fools no better than

the Fools’ zanies.

Madam, yond young fellow swears he will

speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes

on him to understand so much, and therefore

comes to speak with you. I told him you were

asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that

too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is

to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any

denial.

Has been told so, and he says he’ll stand at

your door like a sheriff’s post and be the supporter

to a bench, but he’ll speak with you.

Why, of mankind.

Of very ill manner. He’ll speak with you,

will you or no.

Not yet old enough for a man, nor young

enough for a boy—as a squash is before ’tis a

peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis

with him in standing water, between boy and man.

He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.

One would think his mother’s milk were

scarce out of him.

Gentlewoman, my lady calls.

Here, madam, at your service.

Madam, I will.

Were not you even now with the Countess

Olivia?

She returns this ring to you, sir. You might

have saved me my pains to have taken it away

yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put

your lord into a desperate assurance she will none

of him. And one thing more, that you be never so

hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to

report your lord’s taking of this. Receive it so.

Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and

her will is it should be so returned.

If it be worth stooping for, there it

lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.

My masters, are you mad? Or what are you?

Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to

gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do you

make an ale-house of my lady’s house, that you

squeak out your coziers’ catches without any mitigation

or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of

place, persons, nor time in you?

Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady

bade me tell you that, though she harbors you as her

kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders. If

you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors,

you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would

please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to

bid you farewell.

Is ’t even so?

This is much credit to you.

Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favor

at anything more than contempt, you would not give

means for this uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by

this hand.

’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once

told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself

come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be

one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a

more exalted respect than anyone else that follows

her. What should I think on ’t?

To be Count Malvolio.

There is example for ’t. The lady of the

Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.

Having been three months married to her,

sitting in my state—

Calling my officers about me, in my

branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed

where I have left Olivia sleeping—

And then to have the humor of state; and

after a demure travel of regard, telling them I

know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to

ask for my kinsman Toby—

Seven of my people, with an obedient start,

make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance

wind up my watch, or play with my—some

rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me—

I extend my hand to him thus, quenching

my familiar smile with an austere regard of

control—

Saying, “Cousin Toby, my fortunes, having

cast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of

speech—”

“You must amend your drunkenness.”

“Besides, you waste the treasure of your

time with a foolish knight—”

“One Sir Andrew.”

What employment have

we here?

By my life, this is my

lady’s hand! These be her very ’s, her ’s, and her

’s, and thus she makes her great ’s. It is in

contempt of question her hand.

To the unknown beloved, this, and my

good wishes—Her very phrases! By your leave, wax.

Soft. And the impressure her Lucrece, with which

she uses to seal—’tis my lady!

To whom should this be?

Jove knows I love,

But who?

Lips, do not move;

No man must know.

“No man must know.” What follows? The numbers

altered. “No man must know.” If this should be

thee, Malvolio!

I may command where I adore,

But silence, like a Lucrece knife,

With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;

M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.

“M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.” Nay, but first

let me see, let me see, let me see.

“I may command where I adore.” Why, she

may command me; I serve her; she is my lady. Why,

this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no

obstruction in this. And the end—what should that

alphabetical position portend? If I could make that

resemble something in me! Softly! “M.O.A.I.”—

“M”—Malvolio. “M”—why, that begins

my name!

“M.” But then there is no consonancy in

the sequel that suffers under probation. “A” should

follow, but “O” does.

And then “I” comes behind.

“M.O.A.I.” This simulation is not as the

former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow

to me, for every one of these letters are in my name.

Soft, here follows prose.

If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my

stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness.

Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and

some have greatness thrust upon ’em. Thy fates open

their hands. Let thy blood and spirit embrace them.

And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast

thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with

a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang

arguments of state. Put thyself into the trick of singularity.

She thus advises thee that sighs for thee.

Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and

wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember.

Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so. If

not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of

servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune’s fingers.

Farewell. She that would alter services with thee,

The Fortunate-Unhappy.

Daylight and champian discovers not more! This is

open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I

will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance,

I will be point-devise the very man. I do not

now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for

every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.

She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she

did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this

she manifests herself to my love and, with a kind of

injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I

thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout,

in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with

the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be

praised! Here is yet a postscript.

Thou canst not choose but know who I

am. If thou entertain’st my love, let it appear in thy

smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my

presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.

Jove, I thank thee! I will smile. I will do everything

that thou wilt have me.

Sweet lady, ho, ho!

Sad, lady? I could be sad. This does make

some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering,

but what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is

with me as the very true sonnet is: “Please one, and

please all.”

Not black in my mind, though yellow in my

legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall

be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman

hand.

To bed? “Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to

thee.”

At your request? Yes, nightingales answer

daws!

“Be not afraid of greatness.” ’Twas well

writ.

“Some are born great—”

“Some achieve greatness—”

“And some have greatness thrust upon

them.”

“Remember who commended thy yellow

stockings—”

“And wished to see thee cross-gartered.”

“Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be

so—”

“If not, let me see thee a servant still.”

O ho, do you come near me now? No worse

man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs

directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose

that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites

me to that in the letter: “Cast thy humble slough,”

says she. “Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with

servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of

state; put thyself into the trick of singularity,” and

consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad

face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit

of some Sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her,

but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful!

And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be

looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my

degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together,

that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a

scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe

circumstance—what can be said? Nothing that can

be can come between me and the full prospect of

my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and

he is to be thanked.

Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my

private. Go off.

Aha, does she so?

Do you know what you say?

How now, mistress?

Sir!

My prayers, minx?

Go hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow

things. I am not of your element. You shall

know more hereafter.

Who calls there?

Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to

my lady—

Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged.

Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have

laid me here in hideous darkness—

As hell, Sir Topas.

I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this

house is dark.

I say this house is as dark as ignorance,

though ignorance were as dark as hell. And I say

there was never man thus abused. I am no more

mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any

constant question.

That the soul of our grandam might haply

inhabit a bird.

I think nobly of the soul, and no way

approve his opinion.

Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

Fool!

Fool!

Fool, I say!

Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at

my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and

paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful

to thee for ’t.

Ay, good Fool.

Fool, there was never man so notoriously

abused. I am as well in my wits, Fool, as thou art.

They have here propertied me, keep me in

darkness, send ministers to me—asses!—and do

all they can to face me out of my wits.

Sir Topas!

Fool! Fool! Fool, I say!

Good Fool, help me to some light and some

paper. I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any

man in Illyria.

By this hand, I am. Good Fool, some ink,

paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to

my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the

bearing of letter did.

Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.

Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree. I

prithee, begone.

Madam, you have done me wrong,

Notorious wrong.

Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.

You must not now deny it is your hand.

Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,

Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention.

You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,

And tell me, in the modesty of honor,

Why you have given me such clear lights of favor?

Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,

To put on yellow stockings, and to frown

Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?

And, acting this in an obedient hope,

Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,

Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,

And made the most notorious geck and gull

That e’er invention played on? Tell me why.

I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you!
