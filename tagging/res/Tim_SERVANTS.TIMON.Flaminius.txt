As you have said, my lord.

I thank you, sir.

His health is well, sir.

Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which

in my lord’s behalf I come to entreat your Honor

to supply; who, having great and instant occasion

to use fifty talents, hath sent to your Lordship to

furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance

therein.

Your Lordship speaks your pleasure.

Is ’t possible the world should so much differ,

And we alive that lived? Fly, damnèd baseness,

To him that worships thee!

May these add to the number that may scald thee!

Let molten coin be thy damnation,

Thou disease of a friend and not himself!

Has friendship such a faint and milky heart

It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,

I feel my master’s passion. This slave

Unto his honor has my lord’s meat in him.

Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment

When he is turned to poison?

O, may diseases only work upon ’t,

And when he’s sick to death, let not that part of nature

Which my lord paid for be of any power

To expel sickness, but prolong his hour.

No, indeed he is not.

I need not tell him that. He knows you are

too diligent.

Servilius, help! My lord, my lord!
