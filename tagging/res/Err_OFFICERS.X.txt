That labor may you save See where he comes

I do and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me

I do arrest you sir You hear the suit

Good sir be patient

Good now hold thy tongue

Masters let him go

He is my prisoner and you shall not have him

He is my prisoner If I let him go

The debt he owes will be required of me

One Angelo a goldsmith Do you know him

Two hundred ducats

Due for a chain your husband had of him

Away They'll kill us
