


You'll leave your noise anon you rascals Do

you take the court for Parish Garden You rude

slaves leave your gaping

Belong to th' gallows and be hanged you rogue

Is this a place to roar inFetch me a dozen crab-tree

staves and strong ones These are but switches

to 'emI'll scratch your heads You must be seeing

christenings Do you look for ale and cakes here

you rude rascals

How got they in and be hanged

You did nothing sir

I shall be with you presently good master

puppy Keep the door close sirrah

What should you do but knock 'em down by

th' dozens Is this Moorfields to muster in Or have

we some strange Indian with the great tool come to

court the women so besiege us Bless me what a

fry of fornication is at door On my Christian conscience

this one christening will beget a thousand

here will be father godfather and all together

These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse

and fight for bitten apples that no audience

but the tribulation of Tower Hill or the limbs of

Limehouse their dear brothers are able to

endure I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum and

there they are like to dance these three days besides

the running banquet of two beadles that is to come

An 't please your Honor

We are but men and what so many may do

Not being torn a-pieces we have done

An army cannot rule 'em

Make way there for the Princess

You i' th' camlet get up o' th' rail

I'll peck you o'er the pales else
