


I do it not in evil disposition

But from Lord Angelo by special charge

Away sir You must go

Here if it like your Honor

Pray you do  I'll know

His pleasure Maybe he will relent Alas

He hath but as offended in a dream

All sects all ages smack of this vice and he

To die for 't

Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow

Lest I might be too rash

Under your good correction I have seen

When after execution judgment hath

Repented o'er his doom

I crave your Honor's pardon

What shall be done sir with the groaning Juliet

She's very near her hour

Ay my good lord a very virtuous maid

And to be shortly of a sisterhood

If not already

Save your Honor

Heaven give thee moving graces

Pray heaven she win him

I am the Provost What's your will good friar

I would do more than that if more were needful

Look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine

Who falling in the flaws of her own youth

Hath blistered her report She is with child

And he that got it sentenceda young man

More fit to do another such offense

Than die for this

As I do think tomorrow

I have provided for you Stay awhile

And you shall be conducted

'Tis pity of him

Who's there Come in The wish deserves a welcome

And very welcomeLook signior here's your sister

As many as you please

What's your will father

In good time

A bawd of eleven years' continuance may it

please your Honor

So please you this friar hath been with him

and advised him for th' entertainment of death

Come hither sirrah Can you cut off a man's

head

Come sir leave me your snatches and yield

me a direct answer Tomorrow morning are to die

Claudio and Barnardine Here is in our prison a

common executioner who in his office lacks a

helper If you will take it on you to assist him it

shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall

have your full time of imprisonment and your

deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have

been a notorious bawd

What ho AbhorsonWhere's Abhorson

there

Sirrah here's a fellow will help you tomorrow

in your execution If you think it meet compound

with him by the year and let him abide here

with you if not use him for the present and dismiss

him He cannot plead his estimation with you he

hath been a bawd

Go to sir you weigh equally A feather will

turn the scale

Are you agreed

You sirrah provide your block

and your axe tomorrow four o'clock

Call hither Barnardine and Claudio

Th' one has my pity not a jot the other

Being a murderer though he were my brother

Look here's the warrant Claudio for thy death

'Tis now dead midnight and by eight tomorrow

Thou must be made immortal Where's Barnardine

Who can do good on him

Well go prepare yourself But hark what noise

Heaven give your spirits comfortBy and by

I hope it is some pardon or reprieve

For the most gentle Claudio    Welcome father

None since the curfew rung

No

What comfort is for Claudio

It is a bitter deputy

There he must stay until the officer

Arise to let him in He is called up

None sir none

Happily

You something know yet I believe there comes

No countermand No such example have we

Besides upon the very siege of justice

Lord Angelo hath to the public ear

Professed the contrary    This is his Lordship's man

I shall obey him

I told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me

remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted

putting-on methinks strangely for he hath

not used it before

Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let Claudio

be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon

Barnardine For my better satisfaction let me have

Claudio's head sent me by five Let this be duly

performed with a thought that more depends on it

than we must yet deliver Thus fail not to do your

office as you will answer it at your peril

What say you to this sir

A Bohemian born but here nursed up and

bred one that is a prisoner nine years old

His friends still wrought reprieves for him

and indeed his fact till now in the government of

Lord Angelo came not to an undoubtful proof

Most manifest and not denied by himself

A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully

but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and

fearless of what's past present or to come insensible

of mortality and desperately mortal

He will hear none He hath evermore had the

liberty of the prison give him leave to escape

hence he would not Drunk many times a day if not

many days entirely drunk We have very oft awaked

him as if to carry him to execution and showed

him a seeming warrant for it It hath not moved him

at all

Pray sir in what

Alack how may I do it having the hour

limited and an express command under penalty

to deliver his head in the view of Angelo I may

make my case as Claudio's to cross this in the

smallest

Angelo hath seen them both and will discover

the favor

Pardon me good father it is against my oath

To him and to his substitutes

But what likelihood is in that

I know them both

Now sir how do you find the prisoner

Here in the prison father

There died this morning of a cruel fever

One Ragozine a most notorious pirate

A man of Claudio's years his beard and head

Just of his color What if we do omit

This reprobate till he were well inclined

And satisfy the Deputy with the visage

Of Ragozine more like to Claudio

This shall be done good father presently

But Barnardine must die this afternoon

And how shall we continue Claudio

To save me from the danger that might come

If he were known alive

I am your free dependent

Here is the head I'll carry it myself

I'll make all speed

It was commanded so

No my good lord it was by private message

Pardon me noble lord

I thought it was a fault but knew it not

Yet did repent me after more advice

For testimony whereof one in the prison

That should by private order else have died

I have reserved alive

His name is Barnardine

This my lord

This is another prisoner that I saved

Who should have died when Claudio lost his head

As like almost to Claudio as himself
