


Fair princess you have lost much good sport

What color madam How shall I answer you

You amaze me ladies I would have told you of

good wrestling which you have lost the sight of

I will tell you the beginning and if it please

your Ladyships you may see the end for the best is

yet to do and here where you are they are coming

to perform it

There comes an old man and his three sons

Three proper young men of excellent growth

and presence

The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles

the Duke's wrestler which Charles in a moment

threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is

little hope of life in him So he served the second

and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man

their father making such pitiful dole over them that

all the beholders take his part with weeping

Why this that I speak of

You must if you stay here for here is the place

appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to

perform it

Even he madam

Monsieur the challenger the

Princess calls for you

He cannot speak my lord

Good sir I do in friendship counsel you

To leave this place Albeit you have deserved

High commendation true applause and love

Yet such is now the Duke's condition

That he misconsters all that you have done

The Duke is humorous What he is indeed

More suits you to conceive than I to speak of

Neither his daughter if we judge by manners

But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter

The other is daughter to the banished duke

And here detained by her usurping uncle

To keep his daughter company whose loves

Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters

But I can tell you that of late this duke

Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece

Grounded upon no other argument

But that the people praise her for her virtues

And pity her for her good father's sake

And on my life his malice 'gainst the lady

Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well

Hereafter in a better world than this

I shall desire more love and knowledge of you
