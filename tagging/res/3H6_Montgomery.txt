


To help King Edward in his time of storm

As every loyal subject ought to do

Then fare you well for I will hence again

I came to serve a king and not a duke

Drummer strike up and let us march away

What talk you of debating In few words

If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king

I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone

To keep them back that come to succor you

Why shall we fight if you pretend no title

Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself

And now will I be Edward's champion

And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right

By this I challenge him to single fight

Long live Edward the Fourth
